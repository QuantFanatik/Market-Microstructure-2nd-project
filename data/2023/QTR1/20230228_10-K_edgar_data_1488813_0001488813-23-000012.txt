CUSTOMERS BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Customers Bancorp is a bank holding company engaged in banking activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, Customers Bank, collectively referred to as "Customers" herein. The Bank is a digital-forward financial institution that provides commercial and consumer customers the stability and trust inherent in working with an established and regulated financial institution. The Bank has diversified lending activities that build overall franchise value and a high-tech, high-touch branch-light strategy that serves its customers through a single-point-of-contact private banking strategy with a focus on community banking businesses including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans (to borrowers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York City, New England and other geographies), multifamily lending, SBA lending and residential mortgage lending. The Bank also serves specialty niche businesses nationwide, including its specialty lending, commercial loans to mortgage companies and commercial equipment financing. The Bank offers digital banking to commercial and consumer businesses nationwide, including Banking-as-a-Service to fintech companies, payments and treasury services such as CBIT TM to businesses, and consumer loans through relationships with fintech companies. In 2021, Customers Bank launched CBIT on the TassatPay TM blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, which serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments, including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and other B2B verticals. 
 On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, through a merger with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. All of BankMobile s serviced deposits and loans including the related net interest income remained with Customers Bank after the divestiture. BankMobile was a division of Customers Bank, which offered state-of-the-art high-tech digital banking services to consumers, students and the "under banked" nationwide, along with Banking-as-a-Service offerings with white label partners. The main sources of BankMobile s revenue were from interchange income from its digital checking and savings accounts, deposit servicing fees from sourcing and servicing deposits, digital checking and savings account fees, and subscription fees paid by colleges and universities for disbursement services. BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture are reflected in Customers Bancorp s results of operations as discontinued operations. Customers Bancorp's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the financial results of BankMobile. As a result of the divestiture, Customers' interchange income, deposit account fees and subscription fees decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021. Customers' non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, technology, professional services, merger and acquisition related expenses, and other non-interest expenses including reimbursements from the white label relationship associated with BMT also decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with the divestiture, Customers also entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers incurred expenses of 57.0 million and 59.5 million to BM Technologies under the deposit servicing agreement, included within the technology, communication and bank operations expense in income from continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers held 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers currently expects that approximately half of these serviced deposits will leave Customers Bank by the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of such deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. The deposit service agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. Customers and BM Technologies also agreed to remove Customers' obligation under the deposit servicing agreement to pay BM Technologies the interchange maintenance fee which is the difference between the Durbin-exempt and Durbin-recalculated interchange revenues. The other terms of the deposit servicing agreement remain in effect through the new termination date. Customers and BM Technologies are currently negotiating an extension of this agreement with respect to the serviced deposits expected to remain at Customers Bank after June 30, 2023. The loan agreement with BM Technologies was terminated early in November 2021. The transition services agreement with BM Technologies, as amended, expired on March 31, 2022. Customers entered into a special limited agency agreement with BM Technologies, whereby Customers originates consumer installment loans referred by BM Technologies for an initial period from April 20, 2022 to December 31, 2022, and renews annually unless terminated by either party.

Business Summary

The Bank has a diversified lending business consisting of geographically in-market community banking offerings such as commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, multifamily loans and residential mortgage loans. In addition, on a national level, the Bank also provides SBA lending and financing to specialty banking businesses such as specialty lending, commercial loans to mortgage companies and commercial equipment financing. The Bank also offers digital banking to commercial and consumer businesses nationwide, including Banking-as-a-Service to fintech companies, payments and treasury services to businesses, and consumer loans through relationships with fintech companies. The Bank's specialty lending includes fund finance, real estate specialty finance, technology and venture, healthcare and financial institutions group. Customers' fund finance provides secured and variable rate financing to private debt funds and private equity funds and cash management services to the alternative investment industry. Customers' technology and venture capital banking provides loans to businesses with mission critical software products, recurring software revenues and funded by well-known venture capital firms. Customers' SBA lending also includes a digital small balance 7(a) lending. At December 31, 2022, Customers had total assets of 20.9 billion, including total loans and leases, net of the ACL of 15.7 billion, total deposits of 18.2 billion and shareholders equity of 1.4 billion. Included in total loans and leases was 1.0 billion of PPP loans at December 31, 2022. 
 Customers differentiates itself through its superior technology capabilities combined with a unique single-point-of-contact business strategy executed by very experienced management teams. Customers' strategic plan is to become a leading regional bank holding company through organic core loan and deposit growth and opportunistic value-added acquisitions. Customers identifies itself as a digital-forward thinking super community bank supported by high touch and differentiates itself from its competitors through its focus on state-of-the-art technology and exceptional customer service. Customers' environmental, social and governance, or ESG practices, emphasize its unwavering commitment to its team members, customers, shareholders, and communities in which we live and work. The primary customers of the Bank are privately held businesses, business customers, large corporate clients, not-for-profit organizations and consumers. 
 The Bank s lending activities are primarily funded by deposits from its branch-light business model, which seeks higher deposit levels per branch than a typical bank, combined with lower branch operating expenses, without sacrificing exceptional customer service and its digital bank deposit offerings. In 2021, Customers Bank launched CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, which serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments, including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and other B2B verticals. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the instant B2B payments platform by maintaining U.S. dollars in deposit accounts at Customers Bank. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank held 2.3 billion and 1.9 billion of deposits from customers participating in CBIT, respectively. The CBIT instant payments platform provides a closed-system for intrabank commercial transactions and is not intended to be a trading platform for tokens or digital assets. CBIT tokens are used only in connection with the CBIT instant payments platform and are not securities for purposes of applicable securities laws. There are no scenarios in which the transaction or redemption value of one CBIT would not be equal to one U.S. dollar. Each CBIT is minted with precisely one U.S. dollar equivalent, and those dollars are held in a non-interest bearing omnibus deposit account until the CBIT is burned or redeemed. The number of CBIT outstanding in the CBIT instant payments platform is always equal to the U.S. dollars held in the omnibus deposit account at Customers Bank and is reported as a deposit liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The omnibus deposit account had an outstanding balance of 23 thousand at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. Customers also creates franchise value through its disciplined approach to acquisitions, both in terms of identifying targets and structuring transactions. Enterprise risk management is an important part of the strategies Customers employs.

Current Markets 
 Customers' target market is broadly defined as extending from Washington D.C. to Boston, Massachusetts roughly following Interstate 95. In 2021, Customers expanded its target market to include Texas, Florida, North Carolina and other geographies. In 2022, Customers completed the consolidation of five branches into other existing locations in Southern Pennsylvania, as well as the relocation of a branch in Berks County, Pennsylvania into the Bancorp headquarters and the relocation of the Bank headquarters that were previously announced in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, Customers had bank branches or LPOs serving businesses and consumers in the following locations: Market Offices Type Berks County, PA 2 Branch/LPO Boston, MA 1 LPO Chicago, IL 1 LPO Dallas, TX 1 LPO Mercer County, NJ 1 Branch/LPO New York, NY 1 LPO Jacksonville, FL 1 LPO Philadelphia-Southeastern, PA 4 Branch/LPO Portsmouth, NH 1 LPO Providence, RI 1 LPO Suffolk County, NY 1 LPO Westchester County, NY 1 Branch/LPO Wilmington, NC 1 LPO 
 In addition to the above locations, Customers had 16 other locations with executive and administrative offices and LPOs serving mortgage companies and small businesses throughout the United States as of December 31, 2022. 
 Customers believes its target market has highly attractive demographic, economic and competitive dynamics that are consistent with its objectives and favorable to executing its organic core loan and deposit growth and opportunistic acquisition strategies. Customers believes that digital delivery without geographic limitations is the future of retail banking. 
 Prospective Markets 
 The organic core loan and deposit growth strategy of Customers focuses on expanding market share in its existing and contiguous markets by generating deposits, loan and fee-based services through its Concierge Banking high-tech/high-touch single-point-of-contact personalized service supported by state-of-the-art technology for its commercial, consumer, not-for-profit and specialized lending markets. While Customers has not acquired any banks since 2011, its bank acquisition strategy is focused on opportunistic acquisitions that further Customers' objectives and meet its critical success factors. Customers will also consider opportunistically other acquisitions that will contribute to its banking business. As Customers evaluates potential acquisition and asset purchase opportunities, it believes that there are banking institutions that continue to face credit challenges, capital constraints and liquidity issues and that lack the scale and management expertise to manage the regulatory burden. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Experienced and respected management team. An integral element of Customers' business strategy is to capitalize on and leverage the prior experience of its executive management team. The management team is led by Chairman and CEO, Jay Sidhu, who is the former CEO and Chairman of Sovereign Bancorp. During his tenure at Sovereign, Mr. Sidhu established a track record of producing strong financial results, integrating acquisitions, managing risk, working with regulators and achieving organic growth and expense control. Team leaders Timothy Romig, Head of Middle Market and Community Banking; and Lyle Cunningham, Chief Lending Officer and Head of Corporate and Specialty Banking; have over 30 years of experience. In addition, the banking to mortgage companies group, which primarily includes commercial loans (warehouse facilities) to residential mortgage originators is led by Glenn Hedde, President of Warehouse Lending, who brings 30 years of experience in this sector. This team has significant experience in successfully building a banking organization as well as building valuable community and business relationships in our core markets. Customers continues to hire new talent and promote from within the organization to lead its various product offering initiatives.

Digital-forward super community bank. On July 1, 2021, Mr. Sam Sidhu became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Customers Bank. Under Mr. Sam Sidhu s leadership, Customers Bank partnered with several leading fintechs to establish a technology enabled hybrid banking model, allowing Customers to outperform larger lenders' efforts to support small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through the SBA's PPP loans. As a result, the executive management team undertook a complete rebranding to reposition Customers as a digital-forward super community bank that provides commercial and consumer customers the stability and trust inherent in working with an established and regulated financial institution. In 2021, Customers Bank launched CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, which serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments, including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and other B2B verticals. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the instant B2B payments platform by maintaining U.S. dollars in deposit accounts at Customers Bank. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. CBIT enables Customers to generate additional core deposits. Fueled by a digital-forward, super community bank hybrid business model, and the Bank's recent successes, Customers Bank launched other new commercial financial product lines and opened additional offices in key metro markets around the country, with a focus on the Southeast region. 
 Unique Asset and Deposit Generation Strategies. Customers focuses on local market lending combined with relatively low-risk specialty lending verticals as we expand into new markets across the country. Local market asset generation provides various types of business lending products (i.e., commercial and industrial loans) and consumer lending products, such as mortgage loans and home equity loans. Customers has also established a multifamily and commercial real estate product line that has been primarily focused on the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly New York City. The strategy is to focus on obtaining deposits and refinancing existing loans with other banks, recruiting and retaining strong teams, conservative underwriting standards and minimizing costs. Through the multifamily and commercial real estate products, Customers primarily earns interest income and generates commercial deposits. Customers also maintains specialty lending businesses, commercial loans to mortgage originators and installment loans originated directly or with third-party fintech companies. Customers has significantly expanded its lending and deposit gathering activities through its specialty lending verticals including fund finance (capital call lines and lender finance), real estate specialty finance, technology and venture, healthcare and financial institutions group. Customers' commercial loans to mortgage originators is a national business where Customers provides liquidity to non-depository mortgage companies to fund their mortgage pipelines and meet other business needs. Through the loans to mortgage companies, Customers earns interest and fee income and generates core deposits. Customers' installment loan business is a national business in which Customers originates directly or purchases installment loans through arrangements with third-party fintech companies. Customers also has digital, online savings banking product that generates core deposits nationally. Through the installment loans and digital, online savings banking product, Customers earns interest and generates core deposits. The digital-forward, super community bank hybrid business model enables Customers to earn interest income and generate core deposits. 
 Attractive low-credit risk profile. Customers has sought to maintain high asset quality and moderate credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards, maintaining a diversified loan portfolio, and being selective with its consumer installment loans by focusing on prime borrowers (defined as borrowers with a FICO score of 660 or above at origination) combined with a risk-adjusted pricing model and early identification of potential problem assets. Customers has also formed a Special Assets Group ("SAG") to manage classified and NPAs. As of December 31, 2022, only 30.7 million, or 0.19 , of the Bank's total loan portfolio was non-performing. 
 Superior Community Banking Model. Customers expects to drive organic core loan and deposit growth by employing its Concierge Banking and single-point-of-contact strategies, which provide specific relationship managers or private bankers for all customers, delivering an appointment banking approach available 12 hours a day, seven days a week. This allows Customers to provide services in a personalized, convenient and expeditious manner. This approach, coupled with superior technology, including remote account opening, remote deposit capture and mobile banking, results in a competitive advantage over larger institutions, which management believes contributes to the profitability of its franchise and allows the Bank to generate core deposits. The high-tech, high-touch, model requires less staff and smaller branch locations to operate, thereby significantly reducing operating costs. 
 12 

Acquisition Expertise. The depth of Customers' management team and their experience successfully completing acquisitions provides unique insight in identifying and analyzing potential markets and acquisition targets. The experience of Customers' team, which includes the acquisition and integration of over 35 institutions, as well as numerous asset and branch acquisitions, provides a substantial advantage in pursuing and consummating future acquisitions. Additionally, management believes Customers' strengths in structuring transactions to limit its risk, its experience in the financial reporting and regulatory process related to troubled bank acquisitions, and its ongoing risk management expertise, particularly in problem loan workouts, collectively enable it to capitalize on the potential of the franchises it acquires. With Customers' depth of operational experience in connection with completing merger and acquisition transactions, it expects to be able to integrate and reposition acquired franchises cost-efficiently with a minimum disruption to customer relationships. 
 Customers believes its ability to operate efficiently is enhanced by its centralized risk-management structure, its access to attractive labor and real estate costs in its markets, and an infrastructure that is unencumbered by legacy systems. Furthermore, Customers anticipates additional expense synergies from the integration of its acquisitions, which it believes will enhance its financial performance. 
 Segments 
 On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, through a merger with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. All of BankMobile s serviced deposits and loans including the related net interest income remained with Customers Bank after the completion of the divestiture. BMT s historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture are reflected in Customers' consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Following the completion of the divestiture of BMT, BankMobile's serviced deposits and loans and the related net interest income were combined with Customers' financial condition and results of operations as a single reportable segment. Refer to "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" and "NOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Products 
 Customers offers a broad range of traditional loan and deposit banking products and financial services, and non-traditional products and services such as CBIT, to its commercial and consumer customers. Customers offers an array of lending products to cater to its customers needs, including specialty loans, commercial mortgage warehouse loans, multifamily and commercial real estate loans, business banking, small business loans, equipment financing, residential mortgage loans and installment loans. Customers also offers traditional deposit products, including commercial and consumer checking accounts, non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand accounts, MMDA, savings accounts, time deposit accounts and cash management services. 
 Lending Activities 
 Customers focuses its lending efforts on the following lending areas: 
 Commercial Lending Customers' primary focus is on business banking (i.e., commercial and industrial lending), including small and middle market business banking (including SBA and PPP loans), specialty lending, commercial loans to mortgage companies, multifamily and commercial real estate lending and commercial equipment financing, and 
 Consumer Lending local-market mortgage and home equity lending and the origination and purchase of installment loans through arrangements with third-party fintech companies and other market place lenders. 
 Commercial Lending 
 Customers' commercial lending activities are divided into six groups: Business Banking; Small and Middle Market Business Banking; Corporate and Specialty Banking; Multifamily and Commercial Real Estate Lending; Lending to Mortgage Banking Businesses; and SBA Lending. This grouping is designed to allow for greater resource deployment, higher standards of risk management, stronger asset quality, lower interest-rate risk and higher productivity levels. 
 The commercial lending group, including commercial and industrial loans, owner occupied commercial real estate loans and specialty lending, focus on building business relationships that provide a complete offering of financial services customized to the present and future needs of each business customer. 
 13 

The small and middle market business banking platform originates loans, including SBA loans, through the branch network sales force and a team of dedicated relationship managers. The support administration of this platform is centralized, including technology, risk management, product management, marketing, performance tracking and overall strategy. Credit and sales training has been established for Customers' sales force, ensuring that it has small business experts in place providing appropriate financial solutions to the small business owners in its communities. A division approach focuses on industries that offer high asset quality and are deposit rich to drive profitability. Customers' SBA Lending includes digital small balance 7(a) lending. 
 Customers' Corporate and Specialty Banking includes lending to mortgage banking businesses, commercial equipment finance, healthcare lending, real estate specialty finance, fund finance, technology and venture and financial institutions group. Fund finance, which consists of capital call lines and lender finance verticals, provides secured and variable rate financing to the private debt funds and private equity funds and cash management services to the alternative investment industry. Customers' technology and venture capital banking provides loans to businesses with mission critical software products and recurring software revenues and funded by well-known venture capital firms. 
 The goal of commercial loans to mortgage banking businesses is to provide liquidity to mortgage companies. The loans are predominately short-term facilities used by mortgage companies to fund their pipelines from closing of individual mortgage loans until their sale into the secondary market. Most of the individual mortgage loans that collateralize our commercial loans to mortgage companies are insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government through one of its programs, such as FHA, VA, or they are conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Customers is continuously expanding its product offerings to mortgage companies to meet a wider array of business needs. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank funded 29.0 billion and 55.0 billion of mortgage loans, respectively, to mortgage originators via warehouse facilities. The commercial loans to mortgage companies are reported as loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 Customers' Equipment Finance Group goes to market through the following origination platforms: vendors, intermediaries, direct and capital markets. The Equipment Finance Group is primarily focused on serving the following segments: transportation, construction (includes crane and utility), marine, franchise, general manufacturing (includes machine tool), helicopter/fixed wing, solar, packaging, plastics and food processing. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had 560.3 million and 378.7 million, respectively, of equipment finance loans outstanding. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had 157.4 million and 146.5 million, respectively, of equipment finance leases outstanding. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had 197.3 million and 117.4 million, respectively, of operating leases entered into under this program, net of accumulated depreciation of 52.6 million and 40.7 million, respectively. 
 The goal of Customers' multifamily and commercial real estate lending group is to manage a portfolio of high-quality multifamily and commercial real estate loans within Customers' covered markets while cross-selling other products and services. These lending activities primarily target the refinancing of loans with other banks using conservative underwriting standards and provide purchase money for new acquisitions by borrowers. The primary collateral for these loans is a first-lien mortgage on the commercial real estate or multifamily property, plus an assignment of all leases related to such property. Customers had been deemphasizing its multifamily lending activities and focusing on growing relationship-based commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending activities in the past few years. However, in late 2021, Customers began to increase its multifamily lending. Customers had 2.2 billion and 1.5 billion of multifamily loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank had 13.5 billion and 12.4 billion, respectively, in commercial loans outstanding, composing approximately 85.8 and 85.3 , respectively, of its total loan portfolio, which includes loans held for sale, loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value and loans receivable, PPP. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank originated 7.0 billion and 2.7 billion, respectively, of commercial and industrial loans and leases, exclusive of multifamily loan originations, loans to mortgage originators via warehouse facilities and PPP loans.

Paycheck Protection Program 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. It contained substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included the SBA's PPP, a nearly 350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans were intended to guarantee an eight-week or 24-week period of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. On December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, which provided 284 billion in additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAA provided small businesses who received an initial PPP loan and experienced a 25 reduction in gross receipts to request a second PPP loan of up to 2.0 million. On January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP program to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was enacted expanding eligibility for first and second round of PPP loans and revising the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Customers has helped thousands of small businesses by funding over 10 billion in PPP loans directly or through partnerships and purchases. Customers had 1.0 billion and 3.3 billion of PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, provided that the SBA's eligibility criteria are met and earn a fixed interest rate of 1.00 . 
 Consumer Lending 
 Customers provides home equity and residential mortgage loans to customers. Underwriting standards for home equity lending are conservative, and lending is offered to solidify customer relationships and grow relationship revenues in the long term. This lending is important in Customers' efforts to grow total relationship revenues for its consumer households. These areas also support Customers' commitment to lower-and-moderate-income families in its market area. 
 Customers Bank has a community outreach program in Philadelphia to finance homeownership in urban communities. As part of this program, Customers is offering an Affordable Mortgage Product." This community outreach program is penetrating the underserved population, especially in low-and moderate income neighborhoods. The program includes homebuyer seminars that prepare potential homebuyers for homeownership by teaching money management and budgeting skills, including the financial responsibilities that come with having a mortgage and owning a home. The Affordable Mortgage Product is offered throughout Customers' assessment areas. 
 Customers also originates and purchases installment loans to be held for investment or to be held for sale through arrangements with third-party fintech companies. Customers performs extensive due-diligence procedures on existing and potential fintech partners and only originates and purchases loans that meet its defined credit parameters, which includes but is not limited to minimum FICO scores and debt to income ratios. As part of its due-diligence process, Customers reviews loan level data, historical performance of the asset and distribution of credit and loss information. Customers does not originate or purchase installment loans to be held for investment or to be held for sale that are considered sub-prime at the time of origination, which Customers considers to be those with FICO scores below 660. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had 2.2 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, in consumer loans outstanding (including consumer loans held for investment and held for sale), comprising 14.2 and 14.7 , respectively, of Customers' total loan portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers purchased 481.0 million and 371.0 million of consumer loans, respectively. 
 Private Banking 
 Customers has a Private Banking model for its commercial clients in the major markets within its geographic footprint. This unique model provides unparalleled service to customers through an in-market team of experienced private bankers. Acting as a single-point-of-contact for all the banking needs of Customers commercial clients, these private bankers deliver the whole bank not only to its clients, but to their families, their management teams and their employees, as well. With a world-class suite of sophisticated cash management products, these private bankers deliver on Customers' high-tech, high-touch strategy and provide real value to its mid-market commercial clients. 
 15 

Deposit Products and Other Funding Sources 
 Customers offers a variety of deposit products to its customers, including checking accounts, savings accounts, MMDA and other deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed-maturity retail time deposits ranging in terms from 30 days to five years, individual retirement accounts, and non-retail time deposits consisting of jumbo certificates greater than or equal to 100,000. Customers also focuses on niche businesses as a source of lower-cost core deposits, including property management and mortgage banking businesses, title and escrow funds, health savings accounts, and Section 1031 of the IRS exchange deposits. Using its "high-tech, high-touch" model, Customers has experienced strong growth in core deposits. Customers also utilizes wholesale deposit products, money market accounts and certificates of deposits obtained through listing services and borrowings from the FRB and FHLB as a source of funding. These funding sources offer attractive funding costs in comparison to traditional sources of funding given the current interest-rate environment. 
 In 2021, Customers Bank launched CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, which serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments, including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and other B2B verticals. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the instant B2B payments platform by maintaining U.S. dollars in deposit accounts at Customers Bank. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank held 2.3 billion and 1.9 billion of deposits from new customers participating in CBIT, respectively. The CBIT instant payments platform provides a closed-system for intrabank commercial transactions and is not intended to be a trading platform for tokens or digital assets. CBIT tokens are used only in connection with the CBIT instant payments platform and are not securities for purposes of applicable securities laws. There are no scenarios in which the transaction or redemption value of one CBIT would not be equal to one U.S. dollar. Each CBIT is minted with precisely one U.S. dollar equivalent, and those dollars are held in a non-interest bearing omnibus deposit account until the CBIT is burned or redeemed. The number of CBIT outstanding in the CBIT instant payments platform is always equal to the U.S. dollars held in the omnibus deposit account at Customers Bank and is reported as a deposit liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The omnibus deposit account had an outstanding balance of 23 thousand at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. 
 Financial Products and Services 
 In addition to traditional banking activities, Customers provides other financial services to its customers, including: mobile phone banking, internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment, lock box services, remote deposit capture services, courier services, merchant processing services, cash vault, controlled disbursements, positive pay and cash management services (including account reconciliation, collections and sweep accounts). 
 Competition 
 Customers competes with other financial institutions for deposit and loan business. Competitors include other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, fintech companies, mutual funds, money market funds and certain government agencies. Financial institutions compete principally on the quality of the services rendered, interest rates offered on deposit products, interest rates charged on loans, fees and service charges, the convenience of banking office locations and hours of operation and, in the consideration of larger commercial borrowers, lending limits. 
 Many competitors are significantly larger than Customers and have significantly greater financial resources, personnel and locations from which to conduct business. In addition, Customers is subject to regulation, while certain of its competitors are not. Non-regulated companies face relatively few barriers to entry into the financial services industry. Customers' larger competitors enjoy greater name recognition and greater resources to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns. Customers competes for business principally on the basis of high-quality, personal service to customers, customer access to Customers' decision makers and competitive interest and fee structure. Customers also strives to provide maximum convenience of access to services by employing innovative delivery vehicles such as internet and digital banking, and the convenience of Concierge Banking and our single-point-of-contact business model. 
 Customers' current market is primarily served by large national and regional banks, with a few larger institutions capturing more than 50 of the deposit market share. Customers' large competitors primarily utilize expensive, branch-based models to sell products to consumers and small businesses, which requires Customers' larger competitors to price their products with wider margins and charge more fees to justify their higher expense base. While maintaining physical branch locations remains an important component of Customers' strategy, Customers utilizes an operating model with fewer and less expensive locations, thereby lowering overhead costs and allowing for greater pricing flexibility. 
 16 

Customers Bank's CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments. If a competitor or another third party were to launch an alternative to CBIT (such as Federal Reserve's FedNow Service, a virtual real time payment system for banks, to be launched in mid-2023) we could lose these deposits. Even if we are otherwise able to grow and maintain our deposit base, our deposit balances may still decrease if our digital currency customers are offered more attractive returns from our competitors. There may be competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits to our digital currency customers, which could increase funding costs and compress net interest margins. Further, new technologies, such as the blockchain and tokenized payment technologies used by CBIT, could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including fintech companies. 
 ESG 
 ESG considerations are integrated across our business and incorporated into the policies and principles that govern how we operate. We continuously seek to address some of the practical challenges in balancing short term and long term business trade offs to ensure that our stakeholders and shareholders prosper together.

We continue to make strides in effective external candidate engagement by improving messaging and our employer brand. From an employer brand perspective, we continue to strengthen our external perception by increasing our presence on social media and our Career website page. 
 Internship Program Investing in Early Careers 
 We have developed and implemented an enhanced 10-week internship program to offer a route into banking for exceptional talent. The program offers our interns hands on experience in their role, including, collaboration on team projects, assisting on streamlining tasks and processes, and participating in a Fundamentals of Banking speaker series with senior leaders from all areas of the organization. With this session being the first cohort since pre-pandemic programs, we created a competitive selection process focusing on interns from universities within our markets that are currently majoring in programs that are aligned with the areas of the Bank in which they are stationed. The long-term goal for the program is to build a talent pipeline that can be transitioned into full-time, high contributing team members upon graduation. By providing these individuals with enhanced learning experiences via networking, team building, and on the job training opportunities, we believe these individuals will be prepared to succeed in both their internships and potential roles within our company. This pilot program set the framework for future internship programs, and due to the feedback and overall success of the first cohort, the program will expand in 2023 into additional business units within our company. 
 
 Learning and Professional Development 
 We remain committed to building a learning organization by driving learning through technology and creating an engaging, personalized and varied learner experience accessible to all team members, at every stage of their career. 
 We offer a variety of programs to help team members learn new skills, establish and meet personalized development goals, take on new roles and become better leaders. Our performance management program is an interactive practice that engages team members through performance reviews, goal setting and on-going feedback from managers to their team members. In addition, we developed a career mapping process for several business areas that identified the leadership competencies and KSAs (Knowledge, Skills and Abilities) needed to advance and support an increasingly digital strategy with an emphasis on the four Q s: Emotional Intelligence ("EQ"), Adaptability ("AQ"), Technical Skills and Knowledge ("IQ"), and Cultural Intelligence ("CQ").

Team members have access to business, design, and technology courses to help them develop critical competencies and key leadership attributes. The new learning platform offers a tremendous potential for managers and team members to create development plans as part of the performance review process. 
 Digital Transformation Office Lunch Learns were hosted to educate and train team members on automated processes and procedures on digital platforms across our footprints.

Team Member Engagement 
 2022 was a year devoted to understanding how to successfully transition back to the office in a hybrid model that continues to align with our business strategy and culture during changing times. During the transition we put the health and safety of our team members first while balancing consistent presence with flexibility. We continued to focus on our customers, deliver what we promise, and promote an environment where our team members felt connected, supported and valued. 
 We recognize that our team members' physical and mental health and well-being is incredibly important, deserving of both protection and promotion. We emphasize individual responsibility in terms of personal health but consider health management to be an integral part of our culture. We are committed to providing programs and measures to promote our team members health and well-being in the workplace. 
 Team Member Engagement Initiatives:

Programs included body relaxation, body muscle recovery, light pain management, and strengthening exercises. Total number of team members who participated was 129. 
 Day of Learning Team members are granted up to eight hours of paid time off to participate in an educational course, seminar, or class. 
 Matching Gift Program recognizes the need for individual and corporate support of charitable organizations. For this reason, we will match the financial contributions of active team members up to 500 annually. 
 Community Service Day Team members can earn up to eight hours paid time off for participating in a qualifying event of community service. 
 Team Member Referral Program was refreshed and relaunched in second quarter 2022. The program is a strategy and initiative that monetarily rewards team members for successfully referring highly qualified candidates for open positions. We offer three referral bonus reward levels to team members who submit qualified referrals who are subsequently hired. We hired a total of 55 new team members through the Team Member Referral Program in 2022. 
 United Way We continue to encourage team members to support their local United Way, which provides significant support to the communities in which they live and work. We continue to match team member contributions dollar for dollar. Team members who contributed at a certain level were eligible for additional paid time off. 
 Blood Drive We sponsor an Adopt a Day blood drive through the local blood center several times a year. This allows more flexibility for team members to sign up and donate the Gift of Life. Participating team members are awarded two hours of additional community service paid time off and earn wellness points toward the wellness program. 
 EQ Assessment Coaching EQ is one of the four cultural pillars that we highly value within our team member base. Through 2022, we have continued to provide team members the opportunity to receive an EQ assessment from our leadership and EQ coach, who has been a valuable resource to us for nearly a decade and continues to support our team member population by providing assessments on EQ and coaching participants based on the quantitative data received from their assessments.

Juneteenth Federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans has been incorporated into the Bank holidays. 
 Digital Feedback Tool Team members need to be heard, included, recognized, and cared for and provided with positive leadership to promote a productive and engaging working environment. We utilize a feedback software tool to foster continuous feedback by surveying our team members on a periodic basis on subject matters relating to their work environment, managers, work life balance and overall engagement. Additionally, to further increase team member engagement and increase knowledge of our benefit offerings, we added a user-friendly educational tool to support our annual benefits enrollment. 
 Benefits 
 We view health care as an essential element in building and sustaining a fulfilled, successful, and rewarding work-life balance. We offer a variety of life, disability and medical insurance programs to protect our team members and their families. We constantly review our offerings to ensure they meet the needs of our team members. We increased the Paid Parental Leave Policy to 4 weeks paid leave for eligible team members to care for and bond with a newborn child or child placed within a team member s home due to adoption or foster care. 
 Amid the rising demands of the day-to-day work of our team members and the recent pandemic, we placed particular focus on mental health by providing active and preventive support for team members and their families. We actively encouraged team members to prioritize their mental well-being with several tools, initiatives and resources. We continue to provide free of charge access to our health advocacy vendor, which can assist with services ranging from health care and insurance-related issues to providing one-on-one support for improving health and well-being. In addition to providing access to registered nurses, medical directors and benefits and claims specialists, team members also have access to an Employee Assistance Program ("EAP"). The EAP provides confidential counseling, legal, financial and referral services. EAP participants are entitled to three face-to-face consultations free of charge. 
 In 2022, we continued to offer several enhanced benefits through our family care service provider. Team members have access to a premium membership for ongoing care for their families. Resources included nannies, senior caregivers, transportation assistance, tutors, summer camps, special needs caregivers and more. We also enhanced our telemedicine/telehealth benefits to include general medical visits at no cost to team members, along with no cost dermatological visits, nutritional counseling, mental health visits, as well as expert second opinions and neck and back care. 
 We offer a 401(k) plan whereby eligible team members may contribute an amount (percentage) of their salary (less applicable tax and benefit deductions) and we provide a matching contribution equal to 50 of the first 6 of pay. We hosted a series of financial well-being sessions focusing on a variety of topics: 
 Financial Wellness Workshops We offered workshops to all team members to not only enhance financial knowledge but to better prepare our team members to meet their savings goals and achieve financial wellness. Topics covered included budgeting, managing for unexpected expenses, maximizing Social Security, saving for retirement, preserving savings, preparing for healthcare in retirement and more. 
 Retirement Readiness Workshops We also provided Retirement Readiness workshops to all team members who reached at least age 50 in 2022 to help them to begin the process of preparing for retirement. These workshops included topics such as Medicare, when to start collecting Social Security, budgeting for and in retirement, and education on 401(k) withdrawals in retirement. 
 Diversity 
 We are deeply committed to establishing a workplace culture which is built upon a foundation of dignity, mutual trust, integrity, and transparency. We believe that being intentional about applying the principles and practices of DEIB is essential to achieving the level of CQ necessary to move us forward. The Customers Bank Diversity Council (the "Council") in collaboration with corporate leadership, incorporates the lens of DEIB in establishing clear objectives, measurable goals, accountability, and succession planning to sustain a robust DEIB culture into the future. The Council also works to develop and oversee the Bank s Equity Diversity Inclusion For You ("EDIFY") initiatives which include DEIB-related education, training, resources, programs and team member engagement. This includes the Bank s team member-driven emERGe Forums, which are employee resource groups designed to strengthen team member engagement, support the unique needs of each group, and increase cultural awareness and understanding through allyship. Current emERGe Forums include Asian American Pacific Islander ("AAPI"), Black Excellence, HOLA! (Latino), LGBTQ+, Millennial/GenZ and the Women s forum.

DEIB activities in 2022: 
 Unconscious Bias Training Nearly 400 team members attended one of 16, one hour-long live virtual training sessions entitled, Respecting Each Other Inclusively in Divisive Times . Each interactive session challenged attendees to check their personal biases at the door and be open to listen and learn from those around them. The facilitator's ability to draw from his personal stories provided a learning experience that was fun yet effective in creating understanding and connection. 
 Women s Forum presented a "Women in STEM" virtual webinar on cybersecurity conducted by one of our own cybersecurity professionals. The Women's Forum also hosted internationally known guest speaker in our New York City office where she addressed over 100 team members virtually and in-person. The Bank sponsored approximately 100 women to attend the virtual ABA Women s Leadership Symposium and a hybrid version of the 2022 Pennsylvania Conference for Women, both designed to provide a wealth of personal and professional development opportunities for women. 
 AAPI Forum delivered sweet treats to team members throughout our footprint in celebration of Holi. 
 LGBTQ+ Forum represented the Bank by sponsoring a table at the annual LGBTQ+ event in Phoenixville, PA. 
 Millennial/GenZ Forum hosted a happy hour networking event in our new West Reading branch lobby where they were able to have updated headshot photos taken. 
 HOLA! Forum hosted a pre-Memorial Day cookout on the deck at our West Reading office where team members were treated to delicious Latin-inspired foods. 
 All forums came together to host an emERGe Forum event at our Malvern office which included multicultural foods, games, a photo booth, self-defense training sessions and information about the forums. 
 Freedom Scholarship Program was created in 2020 in tribute to Juneteenth, the annual celebration of the emancipation of African American slaves in the United States. We recognize that the promise of freedom is vitally linked to the power of, and access to, quality education. The Customers Bank Freedom Scholarship Program is our way of providing financial support to dependents of eligible team members towards their educational pursuits. In 2022, a total of 100,000 was distributed among 12 of our team members children. 
 Management and Succession Planning 
 Strategic succession management starts with position-based succession planning and is implemented alongside our performance management process to enable integrated people decisions and follow-up. Succession planning ensures a sustainable pipeline of internal talent for our most senior, key executive, and critical positions, and that these individuals are intentionally developed for enhanced leadership responsibility. There is critical focus on strengthening talent in the succession pipeline, with a focus on individuals who have the required leadership, functional and technical expertise as well as a broad understanding of the Bank. 
 The process used to identify successors includes an assessment based on a series of leadership competencies aimed at continuously deepening our leadership bench of talent to ensure the best possible results are achieved and a plan is established for any management change. In this process, resources not aligned with the competencies at the level of desired performance may be redeployed, shifted, or provided coaching and development opportunities to enhance their performance. 
 We have a structured leadership competency measurement program which was rolled out to the entire company with training opportunities included in the rollout. We continue to identify additional potential successors to the current leadership team of high potential individuals, all of whom have been invited to join a special leadership development program. 
 Digital Transformation of People Operations 
 As an important phase of our digital transformation, we implemented one of the world s top enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms to support the human resources and finance functions including talent acquisition, compensation and benefits. The platform has enabled us to effectively integrate, streamline, and improve human resource administrative functions into a single unified solution.

COVID-19 Response and Return to Office 
 As we entered 2022, we continued to live and work in a COVID-19 environment. The well-being of our team members remained our key focus during the ongoing crisis. We maintained our position on encouraging but not mandating vaccinations as we launched our next phase of the Return to Office ("RTO"). We updated our Code of Commitment to include guidance on managing a mixed immunity workforce and the New York City ("NYC") mandate which stated that any team member required to report to an office in NYC, whether permanently or as an occasional worker or visitor, must either provide proof of vaccination or apply for an accommodation for medical or religious reasons to be exempt from this requirement. Team members who were either assigned to a NYC office or who anticipated working out of a NYC office on occasion, were required to show proof of vaccination status by completing the Vaccine Verification Request form. All badge access was disabled until proof was shown, reviewed, and approved. Proof and accommodations were digitally tracked. The mandate remained in place until November 1, 2022. 
 The Bank's COVID-19 Task Force remained vigilant in tracking and preventing COVID-19 exposures to protect our team members and customers. A COVID-19 Information page was created and maintained on the Bank's intranet and important informational COVID-19 updates were communicated through Bank Notes , an all team member weekly news roundup. All new hires were screened with a COVID-19 questionnaire prior to their start date and informed of the NYC mandate. 
 Effective May 2, 2022, the next phase of our RTO plan went into effect with three flexible options available at the functional and line of business levels: hybrid (2-3 days/or more in the office), remote (no required days in the office except for meetings, training, and collaboration) and traditional (majority of time in the office 5 days) with the goal of having Tuesdays and Thursdays as collaboration days. Our People Experience Team hosted RTO focus groups encouraging open feedback in a relaxed environment. Topics covered in the focus groups included: work-life balance, engagement, areas of opportunity, brand and culture.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 GENERAL 
 Customers Bancorp is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, terms of deposit accounts, loans a bank makes, the interest rates it charges and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations and the establishment of branches. The following discussion summarizes certain laws, regulations and policies to which Customers Bancorp and the Bank are subject. It does not address all applicable laws, regulations and policies that affect us currently or might affect us in the future. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts of the laws, regulations and policies described. 
 Customers Bank has assets in excess of 10 billion, and accordingly, is subject to the supervision, examination and enforcement jurisdiction of the CFPB and is subject to higher FDIC premium assessments applicable to institutions with assets exceeding 10 billion. As a public company, we also file reports with the SEC and are subject to its regulatory authority, as well as the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act, as amended, and the Exchange Act, as amended, with respect to our securities, financial reporting and certain governance matters. Because our securities are listed on the NYSE, we are subject to NYSE's rules for listed companies, including rules relating to corporate governance.

FEDERAL BANKING LAWS 
 Interstate Branching. The Interstate Act, among other things, permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state. A bank may also merge with a bank in another state. Interstate acquisitions and mergers are subject, in general, to certain concentration limits and state entry rules relating to the age of the bank. Under the Interstate Act, the responsible federal regulatory agency is permitted to approve the acquisition of less than all of the branches of an insured bank by an out-of-state bank or bank holding company without the acquisition of an entire bank, only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits. Under the Interstate Act, branches of state-chartered banks that operate in other states are covered by the laws of the chartering state, rather than the host state. The Dodd-Frank Act created a more permissive interstate branching regime by permitting banks to establish de novo branches in any state if a bank chartered by such state would have been permitted to establish the branch. For more information on interstate branching under Pennsylvania law, see Pennsylvania Banking Laws Interstate Branching below. 
 Prompt Corrective Action . Federal banking law mandates certain prompt corrective actions, which Federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions which they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a Federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations have been adopted by the Federal bank regulatory agencies setting forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized. Under the rules, an institution will be deemed to be adequately capitalized or better if it exceeds the minimum Federal regulatory capital requirements. However, it will be deemed undercapitalized if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, significantly undercapitalized if it has a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0 , or has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0 , or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0 , and critically undercapitalized if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . The rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party. In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain restrictions including a prohibition on the payment of dividends, a limitation on asset growth and expansion, and in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers and a prohibition on the payment of certain management fees to any controlling person. Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring, a limitation on the institution s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business, obligations to raise additional capital, restrictions on transactions with affiliates and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits. In certain cases, bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser. If an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized and continues in that category for four quarters, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership. 
 Safety and Soundness; Regulation of Bank Management . The Federal Reserve Board possesses the power to prohibit a bank from engaging in any activity that would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and in violation of the law. Moreover, Federal law enactments have expanded the circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution s Federal supervisory agency; restricted and further regulated lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or related interests thereof; restricted management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions with certain depository institutions whose assets exceed a specified amount or which have an office within a specified geographic area; and restricted management personnel from borrowing from another institution that has a correspondent relationship with the bank for which they work. 
 Capital Rules . Federal banking agencies have issued certain risk-based capital guidelines, which supplemented existing capital requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board imposes certain leverage requirements on member banks. Banking regulators have authority to require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual bank or bank holding company in view of its circumstances. 
 The risk-based capital guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital levels in compliance with risk-based capital ratios. In these ratios, the on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned a risk-weight based upon the perceived and historical risk of incurring a loss of principal from that exposure. The risk-based capital rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. 
 The risk-based capital rules also may consider interest-rate risk. Institutions with interest-rate risk exposure above a normal level would be required to hold extra capital in proportion to that risk. Customers currently monitors and manages its assets and liabilities for interest-rate risk, and management believes that the interest-rate risk rules which have been implemented and proposed will not materially adversely affect its operations. 
 23 

The Federal Reserve Board s leverage ratio rules require member banks which are rated the highest in the composite areas of capital, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of not less than 3.0 . For banks which are not the most highly rated, the minimum leverage ratio will range from 4.0 to 5.0 , or higher at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to be at a level commensurate with the nature of the level of risk of the bank's condition and activities. 
 For purposes of the capital requirements, Tier 1, or core, capital is defined to include common shareholders equity and certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. Tier 2, or qualifying supplementary, capital is defined to include a bank s ACL up to 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, plus certain types of preferred stock and related surplus, certain hybrid capital instruments and certain term subordinated debt instruments. 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bancorp and Customers Bank. The final rules were adopted following the issuance of proposed rules by the Federal Reserve in June 2012 and implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010 and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements. 
 The rules include risk-based capital and leverage ratios, were phased in from 2015 to 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. Effective January 1, 2015, the new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bancorp and Customers Bank under the final rules were: 
 (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 ; 
 (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 ; 
 (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 and 
 (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 for all institutions. 
 The final rules also establish a capital conservation buffer above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements. 
 The capital conservation buffer was phased-in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer was 0.625 of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25 for 2017, 1.875 for 2018, and 2.500 for 2019 and thereafter. 
 Effective January 1, 2019, the minimum capital level requirements (including the capital conservation buffer) applicable to the Bancorp and Customers Bank under the final rules are: 
 (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 ; 
 (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 ; and 
 (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 . 
 Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if their capital levels fall below the minimum capital level plus capital conservation buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 
 Basel III provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer, the countercyclical buffer, of up to 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to take into account the macro-financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth. However, the final rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to advanced approach banks (i.e., banks with 250 billion or more in total assets or 10 billion or more in total foreign exposures), which currently excludes the Bancorp and the Bank. The final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the final rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than 15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, (which includes the Bancorp) will be able to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010, as additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature. 
 In addition, the final rules provide for smaller banking institutions (less than 250 billion in consolidated assets) an opportunity to make a one-time election to opt out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in regulatory capital. Importantly, the opt-out excludes from regulatory capital not only unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities, but also accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit postretirement plans. The Bank selected the opt-out election in its March 31, 2015 Call Report. 
 24 

The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions took effect on January 1, 2015. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized: 
 (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 ; 
 (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 ; 
 (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 ; and 
 (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 . 
 The final rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which were required to be utilized as of January 1, 2015. The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit-risk exposure categories and risk weights and also addressed: 
 (i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; 
 (ii) revisions to recognition of credit-risk mitigation; 
 (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past-due loans; 
 (iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; 
 (v) the option to use a formula-based approach referred to as the simplified supervisory formula approach to determine the risk weight of various securitization tranches in addition to the previous gross-up method (replacing the credit ratings approach for certain securitization); and 
 (vi) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with 50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the advanced approach rules that apply to banks with greater than 250 billion in consolidated assets. 
 In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years, with 25 of the day-one impact recognized on the adoption date (January 1, 2020 for Customers) and an additional 25 recognized annually on January 1 for the next three years. 
 In first quarter 2020, as part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows banking organizations to delay for two years 100 of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25 of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. Customers has elected to adopt the interim final rule. The cumulative CECL capital transition impact as of December 31, 2021 which amounted to 61.6 million will be phased in at 25 per year beginning on January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, our regulatory capital ratios reflected 75 , or 46.2 million, benefit associated with the CECL transition provisions. 
 In April 2020, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that permits banks to exclude the impact of participating in the SBA PPP program in their regulatory capital ratios. Specifically, PPP loans are zero percent risk weighted and a bank can exclude all PPP loans pledged as collateral to the PPPLF from its average total consolidated assets for purposes of calculating the Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio (i.e. leverage ratio). Customers applied this regulatory guidance in the calculation of its regulatory capital ratios. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank and the Bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. For additional information on Customers' regulatory capital ratios, refer to "NOTE 19 REGULATORY CAPITAL" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted by Congress on July 15, 2010, and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Among many other provisions, the legislation: 
 established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a federal agency acting as the financial system s systemic risk regulator with the authority to review the activities of significant bank holding companies and non-bank financial firms, to make recommendations and impose standards regarding capital, leverage, conflicts and other requirements for financial firms and to impose regulatory standards on certain financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to the financial health of the U.S. economy; 
 25 

created a new CFPB within the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has substantive rule-making authority over a wide variety of consumer financial services and products, including the power to regulate unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices; 
 permitted state attorney generals and other state enforcement authorities broader power to enforce consumer protection laws against banks; 
 required that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. On June 29, 2011, for banks with assets of 10 billion or greater, such as the Bank, the Federal Reserve Board set the interchange rate cap at 0.21 per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction; 
 gave the FDIC substantial new authority and flexibility in assessing deposit insurance premiums, which may result in increased deposit insurance premiums for Customers in the future; 
 increased the deposit insurance coverage limit for insurable deposits to 250,000 generally, and removes the limit entirely for transaction accounts; 
 permitted banks to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts; and 
 prohibited banks subject to enforcement action such as a MOU from changing their charter without the approval of both their existing charter regulator and their proposed new charter regulator. 
 In July 2018, the Federal Reserve stated that it would no longer require bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets to comply with the modified version of the liquidity coverage ratio. In addition, in October 2018, the federal bank regulators proposed to revise their liquidity requirements so that banking organizations that are not global systemically important banks and have less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than 75 billion in each of off-balance-sheet exposure, nonbank assets, cross-jurisdictional activity and short-term wholesale funding would not be subject to any liquid coverage ratio or net stable funding ratio requirements. 
 In February 2014, the Federal Reserve adopted rules to implement certain of these enhanced prudential standards. Beginning in 2015, the rules require publicly traded bank holding companies with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees and require bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards. Customers has established a risk committee and is in compliance with this requirement. In October 2018, the Federal Reserve and the other federal bank regulators proposed rules that would tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions pursuant to the EGRRCPA amendments, including by raising the asset threshold for application of many of these standards. For example, all publicly traded bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets would be required to maintain a risk committee. 
 Many of these provisions are subject to further rule making and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, including Customers Bank s primary federal banking regulator, the Federal Reserve. It is not possible to predict at this time the extent to which regulations authorized or mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA will impose requirements or restrictions on Customers Bank in addition to or different from the provisions summarized above. 
 Regulatory Reform and Legislation. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of Customers in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. Customers cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on its financial condition or results of operations. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Customers or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Deposit Insurance Assessments . Customers Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. Under this system, the amount of FDIC assessments paid by an individual insured depository institution, like Customers Bank, is based on the level of perceived risk incurred in its activities. The FDIC places a depository institution in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rates based on certain specified financial ratios. 
 26 

In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate schedules would remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio of the DIF meets or exceeds two percent. As a result of the new rule, the FDIC insurance costs of insured depository institutions, including Customers Bank, would generally increase. 
 On June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP, the PPPLF and MMLF. Pursuant to the final rule, the FDIC will generally remove the effect of PPP lending in calculating an institution's deposit insurance assessment. The final rule also provides an offset to an institution's total assessment amount for the increase in its assessment base attributable to participation in the PPP and MMLF. 
 In addition to deposit insurance assessments, banks are subject to assessments to pay the interest on Financing Corporation bonds. The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. The FDIC sets the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter. 
 Community Reinvestment Act . Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary banks must be considered by the appropriate Federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, in reviewing and approving or disapproving a variety of regulatory applications including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger and certain acquisitions. Federal banking agencies have demonstrated an increased readiness to deny applications based on unsatisfactory CRA performance. The Federal Reserve Board is required to assess Customers' record to determine if it is meeting the credit needs of the community, including the low-and-moderate-income neighborhoods that it serves. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 amended the CRA to require, among other things, that the Federal Reserve Board make publicly available an evaluation of the bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low-and-moderate-income neighborhoods. This evaluation includes a descriptive rating (outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance) and a statement describing the basis for the rating. In May 2022, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a joint proposal that would, among other things (i) expand access to credit, investment and basic banking services in low- and moderate income communities, (ii) adapt to changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (iii) provide greater clarity, consistency and transparency in the application of the regulations and (iv) tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size, business model, and local conditions. Customers will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA and their impact to Customers financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity, which cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors. 
 The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Customers, that are not large, complex banking organizations. These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness, and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 
 27 

In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required certain regulators (including the FDIC, SEC and Federal Reserve Board) to adopt requirements or guidelines prohibiting excessive compensation. In April and May 2016, the Federal Reserve, jointly with five other federal regulators, published a proposed rule in response to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires implementation of regulations or guidelines to: (i) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss and (ii) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulator. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NYSE, to implement listing standards that require listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The final rule requires Customers to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after such listing standard becomes effective. 
 Consumer Financial Protection Laws and Enforcement . The CFPB and the federal banking agencies continue to focus attention on consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB is responsible for promoting fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, deposit accounts and installment financial products and services and for interpreting and enforcing the federal consumer financial laws that govern the provision of such products and services. Federal consumer financial laws enforced by the CFPB include, but are not limited to, the ECOA, TILA, the Truth in Savings Act, HMDA, RESPA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The CFPB is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice in connection with consumer financial products and services. Customers is subject to multiple federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, those referenced above. 
 In particular, fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services, and the enforcement of these laws has been an increasing focus for the CFPB, the HUD, and other regulators. Fair lending laws include ECOA and the Fair Housing Act, which outlaw discrimination in credit and residential real estate transactions on the basis of prohibited factors including, among others, race, color, national origin, gender, and religion. A lender may be liable for policies that result in a disparate treatment of, or have a disparate impact on, a protected class of applicants or borrowers. If a pattern or practice of lending discrimination is alleged by a regulator, then that agency may refer the matter to the DOJ for investigation. Failure to comply with these and similar statutes and regulations can result in Customers Bancorp becoming subject to formal or informal enforcement actions, the imposition of civil money penalties and consumer litigation. 
 The CFPB has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations by institutions under its supervision and is authorized, individually or jointly with the federal bank regulatory agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. The CFPB may bring an administrative enforcement proceeding or civil action in federal district court. In addition, in accordance with a MOU entered into between the CFPB and the DOJ, the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations; however, as a result of recent leadership changes at the DOJ and CFPB, as well as changes in the enforcement policies and priorities of each agency, the extent to which such coordination will continue to occur in the near term is uncertain. As an independent bureau funded by the Federal Reserve Board, the CFPB may impose requirements that are more stringent than those of the other bank regulatory agencies. 
 As an insured depository institution with total assets of more than 10 billion, the Bank is subject to the CFPB s supervisory and enforcement authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. As a result, the Bank operates in a stringent consumer compliance environment and may incur additional costs related to consumer protection compliance, including but not limited to potential costs associated with CFPB examinations, regulatory and enforcement actions and consumer-oriented litigation. The CFPB, other financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, as well as the DOJ, have, over the past several years, pursued a number of enforcement actions against depository institutions with respect to compliance with fair lending laws. 
 UDAP and UDAAP. Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address unethical or otherwise bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as "UDAP," and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. Unjustified consumer injury is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, referred to as "UDAAP," which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP. 
 28 

Privacy Protection and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares "nonpublic personal information," to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. The regulations also require the Bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices. In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not covered by an exception, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to "opt-out" of having the Bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties. 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These regulations implement certain provisions of the GLBA. The guidelines describe the federal bank regulatory agencies expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms. These enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more. The federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards. The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If Customers fails to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, Customers could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. Under a final rule adopted by federal banking agencies in November 2021, banking organizations are required to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a computer-security incident has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization s ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, its businesses and operations that would result in material loss, or its operations that would impact the stability of the United States. In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. In addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Privacy and data security areas are expected to receive increased attention at the federal level. An increasing number of state laws and regulations have been enacted in recent years to implement privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations, including data breach notification and data privacy requirements. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs that meet specified requirements. In addition, other jurisdictions in which our customers do business, such as the European Union, have adopted similar requirements. This trend of activity is expected to continue to expand, requiring continual monitoring of developments in the states and nations in which our customers are located and ongoing investments in our information systems and compliance capabilities. 
 BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION 
 As a bank holding company, Customers Bancorp is also subject to additional regulation. 
 The BHC Act requires the Bancorp to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank. In addition, bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries pursuant to which such holding company may be required to commit financial resources to support such subsidiaries in circumstances when, absent such requirements, they might not do so. 
 A bank holding company is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent (5 of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making this determination, the Federal Reserve Board considers whether the performance of these activities by a bank holding company would offer benefits to the public that outweigh the possible adverse effects. 
 29 

Control Acquisitions. The CBCA prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as Customers Bancorp, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of Customers Bancorp. 
 In addition, the CBCA prohibits any entity from acquiring 25 (the BHC Act has a lower limit for acquirers that are existing bank holding companies) or more of a bank holding company s or bank s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or bank without the approval of the Federal Reserve. On January 31, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board approved the issuance of a final rule (which became effective April 1, 2020) that clarifies and codifies the Federal Reserve s standards for determining whether one company has control over another. The final rule establishes four categories of tiered presumptions of noncontrol that are based on the percentage of voting shares held by the investor (less than 5 , 5-9.9 , 10-14.9 and 15-24.9 and the presence of other indicia of control. As the percentage of ownership increases, fewer indicia of control are permitted without falling outside of the presumption of noncontrol. These indicia of control include nonvoting equity ownership, director representation, management interlocks, business relationship and restrictive contractual covenants. Under the final rule, investors can hold up to 24.9 of the voting securities and up to 33 of the total equity of a company without necessarily having a controlling influence. 
 Applications under the BHC Act and the CBCA are subject to review, based upon the record of compliance of the applicant with the CRA. 
 The Bancorp is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHC Act. Further, under Section 106 of the 1970 amendments to the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve Board s regulations, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit or provision of any property or services. The so-called anti-tie-in provisions state generally that a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the customer obtains additional credit or service from the bank, or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor. 
 The Federal Reserve Board permits bank holding companies to engage in non-banking activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. A number of activities are authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulation, while other activities require prior Federal Reserve Board approval. The types of permissible activities are subject to change by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 PENNSYLVANIA BANKING LAWS 
 Pennsylvania banks that are Federal Reserve members may establish new branch offices only after approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Board. Approval by these regulators can be subject to a variety of factors, including the convenience and needs of the community, whether the institution is sufficiently capitalized and well managed, issues of safety and soundness, the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community, whether there are significant supervisory concerns with respect to the institution or affiliated organizations, and whether any financial or other business arrangement, direct or indirect, involving bank insiders involves terms and conditions more favorable to the insiders than would be available in a comparable transaction with unrelated parties. 
 Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the Bank is permitted to branch throughout Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania law also provides Pennsylvania state-chartered banks elective parity with the power of national banks, federal thrifts, and state-chartered institutions in other states as authorized by the FDIC, subject to a required notice to the Department. The Pennsylvania Banking Code also imposes restrictions on payment of dividends, as well as minimum capital requirements. 
 In October 2012, Pennsylvania enacted three laws known as the Banking Law Modernization Package, all of which became effective on December 24, 2012. The intended goal of the law, which applies to the Bank, is to modernize Pennsylvania s banking laws and to reduce regulatory burden at the state level where possible, given the increased regulatory demands at the federal level as described below. 
 The law also permits banks to disclose formal enforcement actions initiated by the Department, clarifies that the Department has examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries as well as affiliates of regulated banks and bolsters the Department s enforcement authority over its regulated institutions by clarifying its ability to remove directors, officers and employees from institutions for violations of laws or orders or for any unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty. Changes to existing law also allow the Department to assess civil money penalties of up to 25,000 per violation. 
 30 

The law also sets a new standard of care for bank officers and directors, applying the same standard that exists for non-banking corporations in Pennsylvania. The standard is one of performing duties in good faith, in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the institutions and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. Directors may rely in good faith on information, opinions and reports provided by officers, employees, attorneys, accountants or committees of the board, and an officer may not be held liable simply because he or she served as an officer of the institution. 
 Interstate Branching . Federal law allows the Federal Reserve and FDIC, and the Pennsylvania Banking Code allows the Department, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches. For more information on federal law, see the discussion under Federal Banking Laws Interstate Branching above. 
 Pennsylvania banking laws authorize banks in Pennsylvania to acquire existing branches or branch de novo in other states and also permit out-of-state banks to acquire existing branches or branch de novo in Pennsylvania. 
 In April 2008, Banking Regulators in the States of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania entered into the Interstate MOU to clarify their respective roles, as home and host state regulators, regarding interstate branching activity on a regional basis pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997. The Interstate MOU establishes the regulatory responsibilities of the respective state banking regulators regarding bank regulatory examinations and is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on state-chartered banks branching within the region by eliminating duplicative host state compliance exams. 
 Under the Interstate MOU, the activities of branches Customers established in New Jersey or New York would be governed by Pennsylvania state law to the same extent that federal law governs the activities of the branch of an out-of-state national bank in such host states. Issues regarding whether a particular host state law is preempted are to be determined in the first instance by the Department. In the event that the Department and the applicable host state regulator disagree regarding whether a particular host state law is pre-empted, the Department and the applicable host state regulator would use their reasonable best efforts to consider all points of view and to resolve the disagreement.

 General risk factors 
 Risks Related to the Bancorp s Banking Operations 
 Our business is highly susceptible to credit risk. If our ACL is insufficient to absorb losses in our loan and lease portfolio, our earnings could decrease. 
 Lending money is a substantial part of our business, and each loan and lease carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things: 
 the financial condition and cash flows of the borrower and/or the project being financed; 
 whether a loan or lease is collateralized and, if so, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral; 
 the discount on the loan at the time of its acquisition; 
 the duration of the loan or lease; 
 the credit history of a particular borrower; and 
 changes in current and future economic and industry conditions. 
 Our credit standards, policies and procedures are designed to reduce the risk of credit losses to a low level but may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses. 
 Additionally, for certain borrowers, we restructure originated or acquired loans if we believe the borrowers are experiencing problems servicing the debt pursuant to current terms, and we believe the borrower is likely to fully repay their restructured obligations. We are subject to legal or regulatory requirements for restructured loans. With respect to restructured loans, we grant concessions to certain borrowers experiencing financial difficulties in order to facilitate repayment of the loan by a reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining life of the loan to lower than the current market rate for new loans with similar risk or an extension of the maturity date. 
 33 

Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of our borrowers making payments, as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans and leases. As described in "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" to our audited financial statements, on January 1, 2020, Customers adopted ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASC 326"), which replaced the "incurred loss" model for recognizing credit losses with an "expected loss" model referred to as the CECL model. The adoption resulted in an increase of 79.8 million to the beginning balance of our ACL. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and HTM debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model required under previous GAAP, which delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. The CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our reserves. At December 31, 2022, Customers' ACL totaled 130.9 million, which represented 0.93 of total loans and leases held for investment, and 1.00 of total loans and leases held for investment (excluding loan receivable, PPP), a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedules in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, LOANS AND LEASES, Credit Risk ." 
 In determining the amount of the ACL, significant factors considered include loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, trends and absolute levels of classified and criticized loans and leases, trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans and leases, trends in risk ratings, trends in industry and Customers' charge-offs by particular segments and changes in current and future economic and business conditions affecting our lending areas and the national economy, including the economic impact of COVID-19 and its variants. If our assumptions are incorrect, our ACL may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio, resulting in additions to the ACL. 
 Management reviews and re-estimates the ACL quarterly. Additions to our ACL as a result of management's reviews and re-estimates could materially decrease net income. Our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our ACL and may lead us to increase our ACL by recognizing additional provisions for credit losses on loans and leases charged to expense, or to decrease our ACL by recognizing charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such additional provisions for credit losses on loans and leases or net charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and possibly risk-based capital. 
 In first quarter 2020, as part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows banking organizations to delay for two years 100 of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25 of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. We elected to adopt the interim final rule. The cumulative CECL capital transition impact as of December 31, 2021 which amounted to 61.6 million will be phased in at 25 per year beginning on January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, our regulatory capital ratios reflected 75 , or 46.2 million, benefit associated with the CECL transition provisions. 
 Changes in the composition of our loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks. 
 From time to time, we implement changes in the composition of our loan portfolio to emphasize and deemphasize certain types of loans, such as commercial and industrial loans, including specialty loans, loans to mortgage companies and loans to consumers. We may achieve these changes through originations or purchases of loan portfolios from third party originators or fintech companies. Our focus will change, based on our evaluation of current and predicted market conditions and opportunities. Changes in the composition of our loan portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on our overall credit profile, which could result in a higher percentage of non-accrual loans, increased provision for loan losses, and an increased level of net charge-offs, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Consumer loans are particularly affected by economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending, and the number of personal bankruptcies. A weakening in business or economic conditions, including higher unemployment levels, higher inflation, increased interest rates or declines in home prices could adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their loans, which could negatively impact our credit performance. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Customers had 2.2 billion in consumer loans outstanding, or 14.2 of the total loan and lease portfolio, which includes loans held for sale, loans receivable, mortgage warehouse at fair value and loans receivable, PPP, compared to 2.1 billion, or 14.7 of the total loan and lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2021. 
 34 

Our emphasis on commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage warehouse lending may expose us to increased lending risks. 
 We intend to continue emphasizing the origination of commercial loans including specialty loans and loans to mortgage companies. Commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, can expose a lender to risk of non-payment and loss because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or property and the borrower s cash flows. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, we may need to increase our allowance for credit losses in the future to account for an increase in expected credit losses associated with such loans. Also, we expect that many of our commercial borrowers will have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four-family residential mortgage loan. 
 As a lender to mortgage companies, we provide financing to mortgage bankers by purchasing, subject to resale under a master repurchase agreement, the underlying residential mortgages on a short-term basis pending the ultimate sale of the mortgages to investors. We are subject to the risks associated with such lending, including, but not limited to, the risks of fraud, bankruptcy and possible default by the borrower, closing agents and the residential borrower on the underlying mortgage, any of which could result in credit losses. The risk of fraud associated with this type of lending includes, but is not limited to, settlement process risks, the risk of financing nonexistent loans or fictitious mortgage loan transactions, or the risk that collateral delivered is fraudulent or non-existent, creating a risk of loss of the full amount financed on the underlying residential mortgage loan, or in the settlement processes. Fraudulent transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our lending to commercial mortgage companies is a significant part of our assets and earnings. This business is subject to seasonality of the mortgage lending business, and volumes have been declining as interest rates increased. A decline in the rate of growth, volume or profitability of this business unit, or a loss of its leadership could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 13.5 billion in commercial loans outstanding, approximately 85.8 of our total loan and lease portfolio, which includes loans held for sale, loans receivable, mortgage warehouse at fair value and loans receivable, PPP, as compared to 12.4 billion, or 85.3 of the total loan and lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2021. 
 Our New York State multifamily loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation. 
 On June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, impacting about one million rent regulated apartment units. Among other things, the legislation: (i) curtailed rent increases from Material Capital Improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminated the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) eliminated vacancy decontrol and high-income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20 vacancy bonus. In total, it generally limits a landlord's ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing our multifamily loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired. As of December 31, 2022, our total multifamily exposure in New York State was approximately 1.2 billion, of which approximately 693.1 million, or 56 , was provided for loans to rent regulated properties in the multifamily community, primarily in New York City. 
 The fair value of our investment securities fluctuates due to market conditions. Adverse economic performance can lead to adverse security performance and potential impairment. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our available for sale investment securities portfolio was 3.0 billion. We have historically followed a conservative investment strategy, with concentrations in securities that are backed by government-sponsored enterprises. Since 2020, we have been seeking to increase yields through more aggressive strategies, which has included a greater percentage of corporate securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities and other structured credit products. Factors beyond our control significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, such as a change in management's intent to sell the securities, could cause credit losses and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in OCI, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security exists usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.

Changes to estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing financial statements could adversely affect our business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition and capital levels. 
 Changes to estimates and assumptions made by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Changes to management s assumptions or estimates could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition and capital levels. 
 Changes in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results. 
 Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB or the SEC changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the policies that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are at times difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which at times results in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or net worth. For example, we adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 which replaced the incurred loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses and the ACL with the CECL model. As discussed above, our adoption of CECL resulted in an increase to our ACL of 79.8 million. The impact of CECL in future periods will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan and lease portfolio, as well as the current economic conditions and forecasts of macroeconomic variables utilized. Should these factors materially change, we may be required to increase or decrease our ACL which will impact our reported earnings thereby introducing additional volatility into our reported earnings. 
 The geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions makes our business susceptible to downturns in the local economies and depressed banking markets, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We have experienced exponential growth over the last three years as a result of participating in the SBA's PPP loans, and expanded our franchise in new geographies such as Texas, Florida and North Carolina. We intend to grow in these new markets and enter additional markets in the future. As of December 31, 2022, our loan and deposit activities remained largely based in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. As a result, our financial performance depends in part upon economic conditions in these regions. These regions have experienced deteriorating local economic conditions in the past, and a downturn in the regional real estate market could harm our financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within these regions, and because a large percentage of the loans are secured by real property. If there is a decline in real estate values, the collateral value for our loans will decrease, and our probability of incurring losses will increase as the ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be lessened. We expect our loan and deposit activities to continue expanding beyond the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions to service customers across the nation. 
 Additionally, we have made a significant investment in commercial real estate loans. Often in a commercial real estate transaction, repayment of the loan is dependent on the property generating sufficient rental income to service the loan. Economic conditions may affect a tenant s ability to make rental payments on a timely basis, and cause some tenants not to renew their leases, each of which may impact the debtor s ability to make loan payments. Further, if expenses associated with commercial properties increase dramatically, a tenant s ability to repay, and therefore the debtor s ability to make timely loan payments, could be adversely affected. All of these factors could increase the amount of NPLs, increase our provision for loan losses and reduce our net income. 
 We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. 
 We believe that the implementation of our strategy will depend in large part on the skills of our executive management team, and our ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel. Accordingly, the loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect us. We experience leadership changes in our management team from time to time, and if key or significant resignations occur, we may not be able to recruit additional qualified personnel, especially during periods of low unemployment. We believe our executive management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although our CEO, CFO, and President have entered into employment agreements with us, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreement or may choose not to renew it upon expiration. 
 36 

Our customers also rely on us to deliver personalized financial services. Our strategic model is dependent upon relationship managers and private bankers who act as a customer s single point of contact to us. The loss of the service of these individuals could undermine the confidence of our customers in our ability to provide such personalized services. We need to continue to attract and retain these individuals and to recruit other qualified individuals to ensure continued growth. In addition, competitors may recruit these individuals in light of the value of the individuals relationships with their customers and communities, and we may not be able to retain such relationships absent the individuals. In any case, if we are unable to attract and retain our relationship managers and private bankers and recruit individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, our growth strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 In addition, our ability to expand into new business lines, such as specialty lending and digital banking including our CBIT and Banking-as-a-Service offerings, are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We cannot assure you that our recruiting efforts for these positions will be successful or that they will enhance our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key senior personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, such as those in our compliance, risk and legal departments, could have a material adverse effect on us. Because many of our team members continue to work remotely on a hybrid model , the ability of our key personnel and other management to motivate personnel and maintain corporate culture may be adversely affected. 
 We face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, which may materially and adversely affect us. 
 Commercial and consumer banking is highly competitive. Changes in market interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans, and ultimately reduce our net income. Our markets contain a large number of community and regional banks as well as a significant presence of the country s largest commercial banks. We compete with other state and national financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions, for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies, as well as major retailers and fintechs, in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operations in our markets, greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships, as well as better established depositor bases. Competitors may also have greater resources and access to capital and may possess other advantages such as operating more ATMs and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns or operating a more developed Internet platform. Competitors may also exhibit a greater tolerance for risk and behave more aggressively with respect to pricing in order to increase their market share. 
 We expect to drive organic growth by employing our Concierge Banking and single-point-of-contact strategies, which provide specific relationship managers or private bankers for all customers, and by focusing on our corporate and specialty banking verticals. Many of our competitors provide similar services, and others may replicate our model. Our competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be able to provide similar services more quickly, efficiently and extensively. To the extent others replicate our model, we could lose what we view as a competitive advantage, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the ongoing consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Technological advances have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates, as well as non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among others: 
 the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on high quality, personal service, effective and efficient products and services, high ethical standards and safe and sound assets; 
 the scope, relevance and competitive pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; 
 the ability to provide customers with maximum convenience of access to services and availability of banking representatives; 
 the ability to attract and retain highly qualified team members to operate our business; 
 the ability to expand our market position in current and new markets; 
 customer access to our decision makers and customer satisfaction with our level of service; and 
 37 

the ability to operate our business effectively and efficiently. 
 Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 In addition, the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems. In addition to improving the ability to serve customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce long-term costs. These technological advancements also have made it possible for non-financial institutions, such as the "fintech companies" and market place lenders, to offer products and services that have traditionally been offered by financial institutions. The process of "disintermediation," or removing banks from their traditional role as financial intermediaries, could result in loss of customer deposits and other sources of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, in many cases fintech companies and similar non-bank financial service firms, unlike the Bank, are not subject to extensive regulation and supervision. The absence of significant oversight and regulatory compliance obligations may allow such companies to realize certain competitive advantages over us, which has resulted in increased competition for our customers' business. Federal and state banking agencies continue to deliberate over the regulatory treatment of fintech companies, including whether the agencies are authorized to grant charters or licenses to such companies and whether it would be appropriate to do so in consideration of several regulatory and economic factors. The increased demand for, and availability of, alternative payment systems and currencies not only increases competition for such services, but has created a more complex operating environment that, in certain cases, may require additional or different controls to manage fraud, operational, legal and compliance risks. 
 Like other financial services institutions, our asset and liability structures are monetary in nature. Such structures are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of financial instruments held by us. 
 Like other financial services institutions, we have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature and are directly affected by many factors, including domestic and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation, currency values, market conditions, the availability and terms (including cost) of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit capacity or perceived creditworthiness of customers and counterparties and the level and volatility of trading markets. Such factors can impact customers and counterparties of a financial services institution and may impact the value of financial instruments held by a financial services institution. 
 Our earnings and cash flows largely depend upon the level of our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest-rate changes, changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates would reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, and because the magnitude of repricing of interest-earning assets is often greater than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates would reduce net interest income. 
 Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets and liabilities, loan and investment securities portfolios and our overall financial results. Changes in interest rates may also have a significant impact on any future loan origination revenues. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets, both loans and investment securities, on our balance sheet. We have incurred debt and may incur additional debt in the future, and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates and any increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect us. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Adverse changes in the Federal Reserve s interest-rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us. 
 The phase-out of LIBOR as a financial benchmark may adversely affect our business. 
 LIBOR historically has been the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including our lending and borrowing and our purchase and sale of securities that we use to manage risk related to such transactions. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The FCA, which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, has announced that LIBOR will cease after June 30, 2023. 
 38 

Federal banking agencies determined that banks should have ceased entering into any new contract that uses LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021. Banks also were encouraged to identify LIBOR-referencing contracts scheduled to extend beyond June 30, 2023 and implement plans to identify and address insufficient LIBOR-related contingency provisions in those contracts. On March 15, 2022, Congress passed the Adjustable Interest Rate Act to address references to LIBOR in contracts that (i) are governed by U.S. law, (ii) will not mature before June 30, 2023, and (iii) lack fallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practicable replacement for LIBOR. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule implementing this legislation that replaces references to LIBOR in financial contracts addressed by the legislation with certain Federal Reserve-selected benchmark rates based on SOFR. 
 We have adopted a variety of alternative reference rates to replace LIBOR in our financial instruments going forward, including the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index and others. There can be no assurances on which of these alternative rate(s) may become the primary replacement to LIBOR for purposes of financial instruments that are currently referencing LIBOR. We are in the process of managing this transition, facilitating communication with our customers and counterparties, and monitoring the impacts of this transition. The discontinuance of LIBOR may result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and may also increase operational and other risks to Customers and the industry. For Customers' exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments including loans, securities, derivatives, borrowings and preferred stocks, and Customers' transition from LIBOR, refer to "LIBOR Transition" within Part II, Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk". We continue to prepare for the transition of our existing LIBOR exposures prior to the final LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023. 
 Benchmark rates based on SOFR have emerged as viable replacements for LIBOR. The ARRC, which is comprised of a group of large banks convened by the Federal Reserve, has recommended the use of benchmark rates based on SOFR, including a forward-looking term SOFR rate, as alternatives to LIBOR for various categories of contracts. SOFR has been published by the Federal Reserve since May 2018, and it is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve currently publishes SOFR on a daily basis. The Federal Reserve states on its publication page for SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important disclaimers, limitations and indemnification obligations, including that the Federal Reserve may alter the methods of calculation, publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR at any time without notice. In addition, certain benchmark rates based on SOFR, such as the forward-looking term SOFR rate, are calculated and published by third parties. Because SOFR, and such other benchmark rates based on SOFR, are published by the Federal Reserve or such other third parties, Customers does not control their determination, calculation or publication. We cannot assure you that SOFR, or benchmark rates based on SOFR, will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the parties that utilize such rates as the reference rate for transactions. There is no assurance that SOFR (or benchmark rates based on SOFR) will be widely adopted as the replacement reference rate for LIBOR. 
 The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR (or benchmark rates based on SOFR), is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on Customers' business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could: 
 adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with Customers' floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally; 
 adversely affect the value of Customers' floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR s role in determining market interest rates globally; 
 prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Customers' preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates and our implementation of alternative reference rates; 
 result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based financial instruments or discretionary actions taken by us with respect to LIBOR-based securities; and 
 require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, 
 In addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.

Acceptance and success of CBIT, our blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. 
 Customers Bank's CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments, including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and other B2B verticals. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the TassatPay instant B2B payments platform. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank held 2.3 billion and 1.9 billion of deposits from customers participating in CBIT, respectively. These customers are primarily concentrated in the digital currency industry, which has experienced significant disruptions and bankruptcies of FTX and other participants in the digital currency industry in 2022. Customers Bank does not have a deposit relationship with FTX or any of its related companies and has no loans to any customers in the digital currency industry. However, continued disruptions in the digital currency industry could have adverse effects on Customers' business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The CBIT instant payments platform provides a closed-system for intrabank commercial transactions and is not intended to be a trading platform for tokens or digital assets. CBIT tokens are used only in connection with the CBIT instant payments platform and are not securities for purposes of applicable securities laws. There are no scenarios in which the transaction or redemption value of one CBIT would not be equal to one U.S. dollar. Each CBIT is minted with precisely one U.S. dollar equivalent, and those dollars are held in a non-interest bearing omnibus deposit account until the CBIT is burned or redeemed. The number of CBIT outstanding in the CBIT instant payments platform is always equal to the U.S. dollars held in the omnibus deposit account at Customers Bank and is reported as a deposit liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The omnibus deposit account had an outstanding balance of 23 thousand at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. 
 The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems. In addition to improving the ability to serve clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce long-term costs. These technological advancements also have made it possible for non-financial institutions, such as "fintech companies" and market place lenders, to offer products and services that have traditionally been offered by financial institutions. Federal and state banking agencies continue to deliberate over the regulatory treatment of fintech companies, including whether the agencies are authorized to grant charters or licenses to such companies and whether it would be appropriate to do so in consideration of several regulatory and economic factors. The increased demand for, and availability of, alternative payment systems and currencies not only increases competition for such services, but has created a more complex operating environment that, in certain cases, may require additional or different controls to manage fraud, operational, legal and compliance risks. 
 New technologies, such as the blockchain and tokenized payment technologies used by CBIT, could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including fintech companies. New technologies also expose us to additional operational, financial, and regulatory risks. Because many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do, or, at present, operate in a less-burdensome regulatory environment, these institutions could pose a significant competitive threat to us. 
 As noted above, our commercial customers utilizing CBIT are currently concentrated in the digital currency industry. The digital currency industry includes a diverse set of businesses that use digital currencies for different purposes and provide services to others who use digital currencies, including the technologies underlying digital currencies, such as blockchain, and the services associated with digital currencies and blockchain. This is a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the viability and future growth of the industry and adoption of digital currencies and the underlying technology is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, including based upon the adoption of the technology, regulation of the industry, and price volatility, among other factors. Because the sector is relatively new, additional risks may emerge which are not yet known or quantifiable. 
 Digital currencies and tokenized payment platforms, including those utilizing proprietary, non-public tokens such as CBIT, have only recently become selectively accepted as a form of payment by business. Other factors affecting the further development and acceptance of the digital currency and tokenized payment industry, such as CBIT, include, but are not limited to: 
 the adoption and use of digital currencies, including adoption and use as a substitute for fiat currency or for other uses, which may be adversely impacted by continued price volatility; 
 the use of digital currencies, or the perception of such use, to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and ransomware scams by our customers; 
 heightened risks to digital currency businesses, such as digital currency exchanges, of hacking, malware attacks, and other cyber-security risks, which can lead to significant losses; 
 40 

developments in digital currency trading markets, including decreasing price volatility of digital currencies, resulting in narrowing spreads for digital currency trading and diminishing arbitrage opportunities across digital currency exchanges, or increased price volatility, which could negatively impact our customers and therefore our deposits, either of which in turn may reduce the benefits of CBIT and negatively impact our business; and 
 the maintenance and development of the software protocol of the digital currency networks. 
 If any of these factors, or other factors, slows development of the digital currency industry, it could adversely affect our instant B2B payments initiative and the businesses of the customers upon which it relies, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If conditions in digital currency markets change such that certain trading strategies currently employed by our institutional investor customers become less profitable, the benefits of CBIT and our instant B2B payments initiative may be diminished, resulting in a decrease in our deposit balances and adversely impacting our growth strategy. In addition, if a competitor or another third party were to launch an alternative to CBIT (such as Federal Reserve's FedNow Service, a virtual real time payment system for banks, to be launched in mid-2023), we could lose non-interest bearing deposits and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth strategy could be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced employees, which could adversely affect our growth. The further development and acceptance of digital currencies and blockchain technology are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, as discussed above. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital currency networks and blockchain technology may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow and capitalize on our strategy to service the digital assets industry. 
 Our future growth may be adversely impacted if we are unable to retain and grow this strong, low-to-no cost deposit base. We face competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits to our digital currency customers, which could increase funding costs and compress net interest margins. Further, even if we are otherwise able to grow and maintain our non-interest bearing deposit base, our deposit balances may still decrease if our digital currency customers are offered more attractive returns from our competitors. If our digital currency customers withdraw deposits, we would lose a low-cost source of funds which would likely increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. These factors could have material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of our third-party service providers, including CBIT and the instant payments platform on which it operates, could be vulnerable to hardware and cybersecurity issues. Our operations are dependent upon our and our third-party service providers' ability to protect computer equipment upon which these technologies operate against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our or a third-party service provider's team members or other internal sources. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We could also become the target of various cyberattacks as a result of our focus on the digital currency industry. 
 The technology underlying CBIT and the instant payments platform on which it operates may not function properly, which may have a material impact on Customers' operations and financial condition. This same risk exists on our other technology and processing systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems that are outsourced to third-party service providers. The importance of CBIT to Customers' operations means that any technological problems in its functionality may have a material adverse effect on Customers' operations, business model and growth strategy. 
 Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Third parties upon which we rely for the technology underlying CBIT may not be able to develop, on a cost-effective basis, systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, our larger competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 41 

We are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security, or the failure of our third-party service providers to adequately perform their services, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major technology and business process functions, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems to third-party service providers. If we do not effectively select, implement and monitor our outsourcing relationships, or if the third-party service providers do not adequately perform their services or are unable to continue to provide services to us as a result of their own operational or technological limitations or financial or other difficulties, our operations may be materially and adversely affected. While we select third-party service providers carefully, we do not control their operations and at times they encounter difficulties, including disruptions in communications, failures to handle current or increased transaction volumes, cyberattacks, security breaches, data corruption or similar events, during which our ability to operate effectively is adversely affected. Certain of our third-party service providers have experienced performance issues, including a vendor that was engaged to assist us in servicing PPP loans and has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and others will in the future. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the termination of third-party software licenses or service agreements on which any of our information technology and telecommunications systems are based, or other disruption in our relationships with third-party service providers, could adversely affect our operations, and securing replacement licenses and/or engaging alternative third-party service providers and integrating the related technology and services into our systems could result in increased costs and operational difficulties. 
 We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our information technology systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party service providers supplying or supporting our information technology initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace these systems and could suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. These risks are heightened where upgrades and changes are made to information technology systems that are integrated with third party systems. 
 In addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online, over the Internet, through apps and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses, and we expect these expenditures to continue in the future. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Additionally, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Certain competitors may have greater resources to invest in technology and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 42 

Loss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation. 
 We regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, team members and others. This information is necessary for the conduct of our business activities, including the ongoing maintenance of deposit, loan, investment management and other account relationships for our customers, and receiving instructions and affecting transactions for those customers and other users of our products and services. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, team members and others, we compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. 
 Information security risks have increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to team member error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. 
 If this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss. Mishandling, misuse or loss of this confidential or proprietary information could occur, for example, if the confidential or proprietary information were erroneously provided to parties who were not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the systems or our team members or the systems or employees of third parties which have collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored the information on our behalf, where the information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties or where there is a failure or breach of the network, communications or information systems which are used to collect, compile, process, transmit or store the information. 
 Although we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, or that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events would be promptly detected and addressed. Such inadvertent disclosures have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. Such disclosures subject us to liability for damages, including expenses of credit monitoring for those effected, and reputational damage. Additionally, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 
 Breaches of security measures, computer viruses or malware, fraudulent activity and infrastructure failures could materially and adversely affect our reputation or harm our business including the unauthorized access to or disclosure of data relating to BM Technologies serviced deposit account holders. 
 Companies that process and transmit cardholder information have been specifically and increasingly targeted by sophisticated criminal organizations in an effort to obtain the information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions. The encryption software and the other technologies we use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information are not always effective to protect against data-security breaches. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers. 
 Unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records, and could cause interruptions in our operations. Any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our higher education institution customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, expose us to liability for unauthorized purchases and subject us to network fines. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices. Further, a significant data-security breach could lead to additional regulation, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations. Any material increase in our costs resulting from litigation or additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues and profitability. 
 In addition, our student account holders disclose certain personally identifiable information, including student contact information, identification numbers and the amount of credit balances, which they expect we will maintain in confidence. It is possible that hackers, customers or team members acting unlawfully or contrary to our policies or other individuals, could improperly access our or our third-party service providers systems and obtain or disclose data about our customers. Further, because customer data may also be collected, stored or processed by third-party service providers, it is possible that these third-party service providers could intentionally, negligently or otherwise disclose data about our clients or customers. 
 43 

We rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems, databases and infrastructure, and take reasonable steps to protect them. However, due to their size, complexity, content and integration with or reliance on third-party systems, they are vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, natural disaster and random attack, all of which pose a risk of exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized persons or to the public. 
 Our information systems have been, and will continue to be, subject to cybersecurity breaches, which lead to fraudulent activity that can result in identity theft, losses on the part of our banking customers, additional security costs, negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand. In addition, our customers or team members are the targets of scams that result in the release of sufficient information concerning themselves or their accounts to allow others unauthorized access to their accounts or our systems (e.g., phishing and smishing ). Claims for compensatory or other damages may be brought against us as a result of a breach of our systems or fraudulent activity. If we are unsuccessful in defending against any resulting claims against us, we may be forced to pay damages, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because many of our employees continue to work remotely on a hybrid model , the risk of cybersecurity breaches is increased. 
 Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. 
 Further, computer viruses, ransomware or malware could infiltrate our systems, thus disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable. Although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network, they may be ineffective in preventing computer viruses, ransomware or malware that could damage our relationships with our merchant customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, or cause us to be in non-compliance with applicable network rules and regulations. 
 In addition, our team members, systems and customers are regularly targets of fraudulent activity. A significant incident of fraud or an increase in fraud levels generally involving our products could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use of our products and services. Additionally, significant fraudulent activity related to a specific product offering may lead us to limit or discontinue such product. Such incidents could also lead to a large financial loss as a result of the protection for unauthorized purchases we provide to BM Technologies customers given that we may be liable for any uncollectible account holder overdrafts and any other losses due to fraud or theft. Such incidents of fraud could also lead to regulatory intervention, which could increase our compliance costs. Compliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, increased regulatory requirements on our services may increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, account data breaches and related fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A disruption to our systems or infrastructure could damage our reputation, expose us to legal liability, cause us to lose customers and revenue, result in the unintentional disclosure of confidential information or require us to expend significant efforts and resources or incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data and security concerns. The harm to our business could be even greater if such an event occurs during a period of disproportionately heavy demand for our products or services or traffic on our systems or networks. 
 Prior to our acquisition of the Disbursement Business, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC took regulatory enforcement action against Higher One, which subjected us to regulatory inquiry and potential regulatory enforcement action, which may result in liabilities adversely affecting our business, financial conditions and/or results of operations or in reputational harm even after BMT's divestiture. 
 Since August 2013 until the acquisition of the Disbursement Business, we provided deposit accounts and services to college students through Higher One, which had relationships with colleges and universities in the United States, using Higher One s technological services. Because Higher One was not a bank, it had to partner with one or more banks to provide the deposit accounts and services to students. Higher One and one of Higher One s former bank partners (the predecessor bank ), announced in May 2014 that the Federal Reserve Board notified them that certain disclosures and operating processes of these entities may have violated certain laws and regulations and may result in penalties and restitution. In May 2014, the Federal Reserve also informed us, as one of Higher One s bank partners, that it was recommending a regulatory enforcement action be initiated against us based on the same allegations. 
 In July 2014, the predecessor bank referenced above, which no longer is a partner with Higher One, entered into a consent order to cease and desist with the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to which it agreed to pay a total of 3.5 million in civil money penalties and an additional amount that it may be required to pay in restitution to students in the event Higher One is unable to pay the restitution obligations, if any, imposed on Higher One back-up restitution ). We believe that the circumstances of its relationship with Higher One and the student customers are different than the relationship between us and Higher One and the student customers. 
 44 

In December 2015, Higher One entered into consent orders with both the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Under the consent order with the Federal Reserve Board, Higher One agreed to pay 2.2 million in civil money penalties and 24 million in restitution to students. Under the consent order with the FDIC, Higher One agreed to pay an additional 2.2 million in civil money penalties and 31 million in restitution to students. In addition, a third partner bank, which is regulated by the FDIC, also entered into a consent order to cease and desist with the FDIC pursuant to which it agreed to pay 1.8 million in civil money penalties and an additional amount in restitution to students in the event Higher One is unable to meet its restitution obligation. 
 We believe that we identified key critical alleged compliance deficiencies within 30 days of first accepting deposits through our relationship with Higher One and caused such deficiencies to be remediated within approximately 120 days. In addition, we understand that the total amount of fees that Higher One collected from students who opened accounts with us during the relevant time period is substantially less than the total fees that Higher One collected from students who opened deposit accounts at the other partner banks during the relevant time period. In addition, as Higher One paid the restitution and deposited such monies to pay the required restitution, we did not expect that backup restitution would be required. 
 Nonetheless, as previously disclosed, we had been in discussions with the Federal Reserve Board regarding these matters from 2013 and in an effort to move forward, on December 6, 2016, we agreed to the issuance by the Federal Reserve Board of a combined Order to Cease and Desist and Order of Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty Issued Upon Consent Pursuant to the Order and agreed to a penalty of 960 thousand. We had previously set aside a reserve for the civil money penalty and made payment in 2016. 
 In June 2016, Customers acquired the Disbursement Business of Higher One and subsequently combined that business with BankMobile. Customers successfully launched BankMobile, America's first mobile platform based full-service consumer bank in January 2015. On January 4, 2021, Customers completed the divestiture of BMT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, which included the Disbursement Business, through a merger with MFAC. 
 We remain subject to the jurisdiction and examination of the Federal Reserve Board, and further action could be taken to the extent we do not comply with the terms of the Order or if the Federal Reserve Board were to identify additional violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any further action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and/or results of operations or our reputation. 
 We intend to engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time. These acquisitions may not produce revenue or earnings enhancements or cost savings at levels, or within time frames, originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties. 
 Although we currently do not have any agreements or understandings with respect to business acquisitions, we regularly evaluate opportunities to strengthen our current market position by acquiring and investing in banks and in other complementary businesses, or opening new branches, and when appropriate opportunities arise, subject to regulatory approval, we plan to engage in acquisitions of other businesses and in opening new branches. Such transactions could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business. For example, we could issue additional shares of Voting Common Stock in a purchase transaction, which could dilute current shareholders value or ownership interest. These activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash or other liquid assets and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Our acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of: 
 incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating the terms of potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business; 
 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets; 
 being potentially exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire; 
 being required to expend time and expense to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; 
 experiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations; 
 creating an adverse effect on our results of operations; 
 losing key team members and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received; and 
 incurring significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity being acquired into our financial and customer product systems. 
 45 

Additionally, in evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, we may seek to acquire failed banks through FDIC-assisted acquisitions. While the FDIC may, in such acquisitions, provide assistance to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities, of the failed institution, we may not be able to accurately estimate our potential exposure to loan losses and other potential liabilities, or the difficulty of integration, in acquiring such institutions. 
 Depending on the condition of any institutions or assets that are acquired, any acquisition may, at least in the near term, materially adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated following the acquisition, may continue to have such effects. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on levels of reported net income, return on equity and return on assets and the ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain market value. 
 Our acquisitions generally will require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them would restrict our growth. 
 Although we currently do not have any agreements or understandings with respect to business acquisitions, we may in the future seek to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of community banking franchises and other businesses. Generally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, banking centers or other banking assets by us may require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC, as well as state banking regulators. In acting on applications, federal banking regulators consider, among other factors: 
 the effect of the acquisition on competition; 
 the financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, capital levels and future prospects of the applicant and the bank(s) involved; 
 the quantity and complexity of previously consummated acquisitions; 
 the managerial resources of the applicant and the bank(s) involved; 
 the convenience and needs of the community, including the record of performance under CRA; 
 the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities; and 
 the extent to which the acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. 
 Such regulators could delay or deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations, which could restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals, and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. 
 To the extent that we are unable to increase loans through organic core loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 In addition to growing our business through strategic acquisitions, we also intend to grow our business through organic core loan growth. While loan growth has been strong, and our loan balances have increased over the last several fiscal years, if we are unsuccessful in diversifying our loan originations, or if we do not grow the business lines, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth. 
 Our future operating results and financial condition depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our growth has placed, and it may continue to place, significant demands on our operations and management. Whether through additional acquisitions or organic growth, our current plan to expand our business is dependent upon our ability to: 
 continue to implement and improve our operational, credit underwriting and administration, financial, accounting, enterprise risk management and other internal and disclosure controls and procedures and our reporting systems and processes in order to manage a growing number of client relationships; 
 comply with changes in, and an increasing number of, laws, rules and regulations, including those of any national securities exchange on which any of our securities become listed; 
 scale our technology and other systems platforms; 
 maintain and attract appropriate staffing; 
 46 

operate profitably or raise capital; and 
 support our asset growth with adequate deposits, funding and liquidity while expanding our net interest margin and meeting our customers and regulators liquidity requirements. 
 We may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, credit underwriting and administration, internal and disclosure controls, and procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in loan volume in various markets and the infrastructure that comes with new banking centers and banks. Our growth strategy may divert management from our existing business and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure and, if we are unable to effectively manage and grow our banking franchise, including to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to manage our current and future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance, operational and regulatory problems and delays, have to slow our pace of growth or even stop our market and product expansion, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could materially and adversely affect us. If we experience difficulties with the development of new business activities or the integration process of acquired businesses, the anticipated benefits of any particular acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may be unable to recognize synergies, operating efficiencies, cost projections and/or expected benefits within expected time frames, or at all. We also may not be able to preserve the goodwill of an acquired financial institution. Our growth could lead to increases in our legal, audit, administrative and financial compliance costs, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 If our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses. 
 In order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business, we must maintain effective policies, procedures and systems that enable us to identify, monitor and control our exposure to material risks, such as credit, interest rate, operational, compliance and reputational risks. Our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design, implementation or the degree to which we adhere to them, or as a result of the lack of adequate, accurate or timely information or otherwise. If our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to litigation, particularly from our customers, and sanctions or fines from regulators. Our techniques for managing the risks we face may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments, including exposure to risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. 
 We are dependent upon maintaining an effective system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions and activities are conducted in accordance with established policies and procedures and are captured and reported in the financial statements. Failure to comply with the system of internal controls may result in events or losses which could adversely affect our operations, net income, financial condition, reputation and compliance with laws and regulations. 
 Our system of internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, is an important element of our risk management framework. Management regularly reviews and seeks to improve our internal controls, including annual review of key policies and procedures and annual review and testing of key internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and expectations of employee conduct and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control structure are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, net income, financial condition, reputation, compliance with laws and regulations, or may result in untimely or inaccurate financial reporting. 
 As management continues to evaluate and work to enhance internal control over financial reporting, it may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies or strengthen internal control over financial reporting. If Customers' remediation efforts do not operate effectively or if it is unsuccessful in implementing or following its remediation efforts, this may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of Customers' financial results. 
 47 

We may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our loan funding obligations, deposit withdrawals, or other business needs and fund our asset growth unless we maintain sufficient liquidity. 
 We must maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our balance sheet growth in order to successfully grow our revenues, make loans, and repay deposit and other liabilities as these mature or are drawn. This liquidity can be gathered in both wholesale and non-wholesale funding markets. Our asset growth over the past few years has been funded with various forms of deposits and wholesale funding, including brokered and wholesale time deposits, FHLB advances and Federal funds line borrowings. Total wholesale deposits including brokered and municipal deposits were 28.2 of total deposits at December 31, 2022. Our gross loan to deposit ratio was 87.0 at December 31, 2022. Wholesale funding can cost more than deposits generated from our traditional branch system and customer relationships and is subject to certain practical limits such as our liquidity policy limits, our available collateral for FHLB borrowings capacity and Federal funds line limits with our lenders. Additionally, regulators consider wholesale funding beyond certain points to be imprudent and might suggest or require that future asset growth be reduced or halted. In the absence of appropriate levels and mix of funding, we might need to reduce interest-earning asset growth through the reduction of current production, sales of loans and/or the sale of participation interests in future and current loans. This might reduce our future growth and net income. 
 The amount of funds loaned to us is generally dependent on the value of the eligible collateral pledged and our financial condition. These lenders could reduce the percentages loaned against various collateral categories, eliminate certain types of collateral and otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs, if further disruptions in the capital markets occur. Further, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator of FHLB and other federal home loan banks, launched a comprehensive review of the Federal Home Loan Bank System including the mission, membership eligibility requirements, and operational efficiencies of the federal home loan banks in 2022. Any change to or termination of our borrowings from the FHLB or correspondent banks could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, including liquidity. 
 We may not be able to develop and retain a strong core deposit base and other low-cost, stable funding sources. 
 We depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as a primary source of funding for our lending activities. We expect that our future loan growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong, low-cost deposit base. As of December 31, 2022, 3.4 billion, or 79.8 , of our total time deposits, are scheduled to mature through December 31, 2023. We are working to transition certain of our customers to lower-cost traditional bank deposits as higher-cost funding, such as time deposits, mature and to grow our customer deposits. If interest rates continue to increase, whether due to changes in inflation, monetary policy, competition or other factors, we would expect to pay higher interest rates on deposits, which would increase our funding costs and compress our net interest margin. We may not succeed in moving our deposits to lower-yielding savings and transactions products, which could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, customers, particularly those who may maintain deposits in excess of insured limits, continue to be concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Our customers may withdraw deposits to ensure that their deposits with us are fully insured and may place excess amounts in other institutions or make investments that are perceived as being more secure and/or higher yielding. Further, even if we are able to maintain and grow our deposit base, deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, will provide a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits, we could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. 
 Certain deposit balances serviced by BM Technologies can vary over the course of the year based on student enrollment and the timing of deposits made into those accounts, with seasonal inflows at the start of each semester that are drawn down until the following semester. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity. Customers held 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers currently expects that approximately half of these serviced deposits will leave Customers Bank by the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of such deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. The deposit service agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. Customers and BM Technologies are currently negotiating an extension of this agreement with respect to the serviced deposits expected to remain at Customers Bank after June 30, 2023. 
 48 

Competitors technology-driven products and services and improvements to such products and services may adversely affect our ability to generate core deposits through mobile banking. 
 Our organic growth strategy focuses on, among other things, expanding market share through our high-tech model, which includes remote account opening, remote deposit capture, mobile and digital banking. These technological advances are intended to allow us to generate additional core deposits at a lower cost than generating deposits through opening and operating branch locations. Some of our competitors may have greater resources to invest in technology and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. This may result in limiting, reducing or otherwise adversely affecting our growth strategy in this area and our access to deposits through mobile banking. In addition, to the extent we fail to keep pace with technological changes or incur respectively large expenses to implement technological changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 We may incur losses due to minority investments in other financial institutions or related companies. 
 We make and consider making additional minority investments in other financial institutions or technology companies in the financial services business, or other unrelated businesses, including for strategic reasons or to see technological improvements or advantages. If we do so, we may not be able to influence the activities of companies in which we invest and may suffer losses due to these activities. 
 Risks related to the divestiture of BMT 
 We continue to face the risks and challenges associated with BM Technologies following the merger of BMT with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. 
 On January 4, 2021, we completed the divestiture of BMT through the merger of BMT with MFAC. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. Our agreement with MFAC relating to the merger of BMT and MFAC provided that the shares issuable by MFAC in connection with the merger would be issued directly to Customers Bancorp shareholders rather than being issued to and held by us. In connection with the divestiture, we have entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. The deposit service agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. Customers and BM Technologies also agreed to remove Customers' obligation under the deposit servicing agreement to pay BM Technologies the interchange maintenance fee which is the difference between the Durbin-exempt and Durbin-recalculated interchange revenues. The other terms of the deposit servicing agreement remain in effect through the new termination date. Customers and BM Technologies are currently negotiating an extension of this agreement with respect to the serviced deposits expected to remain at Customers Bank after June 30, 2023. The loan agreement with BM Technologies was terminated early in November 2021. The transition services agreement with BM Technologies, as amended, expired on March 31, 2022. Customers entered into a special limited agency agreement with BM Technologies, whereby Customers originates consumer installment loans referred by BM Technologies for an initial period from April 20, 2022 to December 31, 2022, and renews annually unless terminated by either party. We are exposed to potential liabilities to the acquirer under the contractual provisions such as representation, warranties and indemnities. If we are unable to address and manage these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Risks related to Macroeconomic Conditions, COVID-19, Climate Change and Geopolitical Conflict 
 Worsening general business and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy experiences worsening conditions such as a recession, we could be materially and adversely affected. Weak economic conditions may be characterized by deflation or stagflation, instability in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. Adverse changes in any of these factors could be detrimental to our business. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. Federal Government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Adverse changes in economic factors or U.S. Government policies could have a negative effect on us. 
 Over the last several years, there have been several instances where there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of Congress and the President collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters. A period of failure to reach agreement on these matters, particularly if accompanied by an actual or threatened government shutdown, may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy. Additionally, a prolonged government shutdown may inhibit our ability to evaluate borrower creditworthiness and originate and sell certain government-backed loans. 
 49 

In addition, the U.S. economy contracted into a recession in the first half of 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures. The U.S. economy has since strengthened despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, with higher inflation and housing values beginning in 2021. Also, the ongoing global supply chain issues and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine contributed to higher inflation in 2022. In response, the Federal Reserve began normalizing monetary policy with its decision in late 2021 to taper its quantitative easing and raising the federal funds rate beginning in March 2022. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to COVID-19 and its variants, higher food and energy prices from the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and broader price pressures. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly throughout 2022 to lower inflation. While certain factors point to improving economic conditions, including moderating inflation, uncertainty remains regarding the path of the economic recovery and the mitigating impacts of government interventions. Conditions related to inflation, global supply chains, labor market, volatile interest rates, international conflicts, changes in trade policies and other factors, such as real estate values, state and local municipal budget deficits, government spending and the U.S. national debt may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The COVID-19 and its variants have impacted our business, and the ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including their scope, duration and severity and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19 and its variants. 
 The COVID-19 and its variants have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and the labor market. Furthermore, the economic impact of COVID-19 and its variants have influenced and could further influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan and lease portfolios. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, the securities we hold may lose value. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19 and its variants. The extent to which COVID-19 and its variants impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including: 
 The duration, extent, and severity of COVID-19 and its variants. Continuing spread and rise of new variants could affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates and general economic and financial instability. The continuation of the disease may also negatively impact regional economic conditions for a period of time, resulting in declines in loan demand and collateral values. The duration and severity of the disease continues to be impossible to predict, as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence. We may continue to see the economic effects of COVID-19 and its variants even after the national emergency and public health emergency declarations are lifted, which is expected to continue to affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. 
 The response of governmental authorities. Many of the actions of governmental authorities, including eviction forbearance, suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, enacted during the outbreak of COVID-19 have ended. The end of various governmental support may have negative impacts on our customers including increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. 
 The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties have affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Negative impacts on our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. 
 The effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. Governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment and financial-market activity and could have lasting effects on taxes and other economic factors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 To the extent COVID-19 and its variants continue to adversely affect the economy, and/or adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described herein, including those risks related to business operations, industry/market, our securities and credit, or risks described in our other filings with the SEC.

We are a participating lender in SBA s PPP program and have originated a significant number of loans under this program, which may result in a material amount of PPP loans remaining on our consolidated balance sheets at a very low yield for an extended period of time. 
 The PPP, originally established under the CARES Act and extended under the Economic Aid Act and CAA, authorized financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profit organizations. These loans carry an interest rate of 1 per annum and a maturity of 2 years for loans originated prior to June 5, 2020 and 5 years for loans originated on or after June 5, 2020. The PPP provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated. The initial phase of the PPP, after being extended multiple times by Congress, expired on August 8, 2020. However, on January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for First Draw PPP loans to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. Further, on January 13, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for Second Draw loans to small businesses and non-profit organizations that did receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. At least 25 billion had been set aside for Second Draw PPP loans to eligible borrowers with a maximum of 10 employees or for loans of 250,000 or less to eligible borrowers in low or moderate income neighborhoods. Generally, businesses with more than 300 employees and/or less than a 25 percent reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020 were not eligible for Second Draw loans. Further, maximum loan amounts were increased for accommodation and food service businesses. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was enacted expanding eligibility for first and second round of PPP loans and revising the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had PPP loans with outstanding balances of 1.0 billion. Our PPP participation was very significant especially compared to the participation of similarly sized and larger competitor financial institutions. Considering our immediate response to originate PPP loans, the loans originated under this program may present potential fraud or other risks, increasing the risk that loan forgiveness may not be obtained by the borrowers and that the guaranty may not be honored and may result in increased provision expense or charge-offs. In addition, there is risk that the borrowers may not qualify for the loan forgiveness feature due to the conduct of the borrower after the loan is originated. Further, although the SBA has streamlined the loan forgiveness process for loans 150,000 or less, these factors may result in us having to hold a significant amount of these low-yield loans on our books for a significant period of time. We will continue to face increased operational demands and pressures as we monitor and service our PPP loan portfolio, process applications for loan forgiveness and pursue recourse under the SBA guarantees. We have been subjected to regulatory audits and investigations related to our PPP program and could be subject to additional litigation and further investigation and scrutiny by our regulators, Congress, the SBA, the U.S. Treasury Department and other government agencies related to our PPP participation. 
 Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business. 
 The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives are expected to continue, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks' risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systematic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate related factors, and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes and new reporting obligations, each of which may require Customers to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to Customers. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 51 

Severe weather, natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our ability to conduct business. 
 Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, adversely impact our team member base, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and cause us to incur additional expenses. For example, one of our locations experienced flooding and incurred property damage in 2021 as a result. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate, including the effects of heightened regulatory requirements applicable to banks with assets in excess of 10 billion. 
 As a bank holding company, we are subject to federal supervision and regulation. Federal regulation of the banking industry, along with tax and accounting laws, regulations, rules and standards, may limit our operations significantly and control the methods by which we conduct business, just as they limit those of other banking organizations. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations can impose additional compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes on financial institutions, is an example of this type of federal regulation. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, customers, the public, the banking system as a whole, or the FDIC insurance funds, not stockholders. Regulatory requirements and discretion affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. There are laws and regulations which restrict transactions between us and our subsidiaries. These requirements may constrain our operations, and the adoption of new laws and changes to or repeal of existing laws may have a further impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Also, the burden imposed by those federal and state regulations may place banks in general, including Customers Bank in particular, at a competitive disadvantage compared to their non-banking competitors. We are also subject to requirements with respect to the confidentiality of information obtained from clients concerning their identities, business and personal financial information, employment and other matters. We require our team members to agree to keep all such information confidential, and we monitor compliance. Failure to comply with confidentiality requirements could result in material liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 
 Bank holding companies and financial institutions are extensively regulated and currently face an uncertain regulatory environment. Applicable laws, regulations, interpretations, enforcement policies and accounting principles have been subject to significant changes in recent years and may be subject to significant future changes. Future changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Federal and state regulatory agencies may adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or interpreted. We cannot predict the substance or effect of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of laws and regulations on us. Compliance with current and potential regulation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner by requiring us to expend significant time, effort and resources to ensure compliance and respond to any regulatory inquiries or investigations. In addition, press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing by financial services companies (including press coverage and public statements that do not involve us) have and may in the future result in regulatory inquiries or investigations, which, independent of the outcome, may be time-consuming and expensive and may divert time, effort and resources from our business. Evolving regulations and guidance concerning executive compensation may also impose limitations on us that affect our ability to compete successfully for executive and management talent. 
 In addition, given the current economic and financial environment, regulators may elect to alter standards or the interpretation of the standards used to measure regulatory compliance or to determine the adequacy of liquidity, certain risk management or other operational practices for financial services companies in a manner that impacts our ability to implement our strategy and could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies have extremely broad direction in their interpretation of the regulations and laws and their interpretation of the quality of our loan portfolio, securities portfolio and other assets. If any regulatory agency s assessment of the quality of our assets, operations, lending practices, investment practices, capital structure or other assets of our business differs from our assessment, we may be required to take additional charges or undertake or refrain from undertaking actions that would have the effect of materially reducing our earnings, capital ratios and share price. 
 52 

Because our total assets exceeded 10 billion at December 31, 2019, we and our bank subsidiary became subject to increased regulatory requirements in 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with 10 billion or more in total assets. In addition, banks with 10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is some uncertainty as to how the CFPB s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business. Further, the possibility of future changes in the authority of the CFPB by Congress or the current administration is uncertain, and we cannot predict the impact, if any, changes to the CFPB may have on our business. 
 With respect to deposit-taking activities, banks with assets in excess of 10 billion are subject to two changes. First, these institutions are subject to a deposit assessment based on a new scorecard issued by the FDIC. This scorecard considers, among other things, the bank s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the bank s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 1.5 to 40 basis points. Any increase in our bank subsidiary s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source. Additionally, banks with over 10 billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. This means that, as of July 1, 2020, our bank subsidiary is limited to receiving only a reasonable interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by our bank subsidiary to our customers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than 10 billion in total assets to receive more than 0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction plus a 0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. This reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange reduced our revenues in 2020, and will continue to affect our results of operations for the duration of the Deposit Servicing Agreement with BM Technologies. 
 Our regulators may also consider our compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters. 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors and the FDIC s DIF and not our shareholders, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities, limit the dividends or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of our subsidiary bank to engage in transactions with the Bancorp, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than under generally accepted accounting principles. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs and may make certain products impermissible or uneconomic. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, fines and other penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive and also materially and adversely affect us. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with 1 billion or more in assets, such as the Company. These prohibitions may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract executives and other high-performing team members or our ability to compete with companies that are not subject to such provisions. 
 Our use of third-party service providers and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention. 
 We regularly use third-party service providers as part of our business and have other ongoing business relationships with other third parties, including BM Technologies after the completion of the divestiture of BMT on January 4, 2021. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by federal banking regulators. Regulation requires us to perform enhanced due diligence, perform ongoing monitoring and control our third-party service providers and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these third-party service providers to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party service providers or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 53 

We are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations and to regular examinations by our regulators of our business and compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to adequately address any matters identified during our examinations could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Federal banking agencies regularly conduct comprehensive examinations of our business, including our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies. Examination reports and ratings (which often are not publicly available) and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially impact the conduct, organic and acquisition growth and profitability of our business. Our regulators have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities and may impose a variety of remedial actions, conditions or limitations on our business operations if, as a result of an examination, they determined that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management were in violation of any law, regulation or policy. Examples of those actions, conditions or limitations include enjoining unsafe or unsound practices, requiring affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any asserted violation of law, issuing administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, directing increases in our capital, assessing civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, removing officers and directors and, if a conclusion was reached that the offending conditions cannot be corrected, or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, terminating our deposit insurance. Other actions, formal or informal, that may be imposed could restrict our growth, including regulatory denials to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities or merge with or purchase other financial institutions. The timing of these examinations, including the timing of the resolution of any issues identified by our regulators in the examinations and the final determination by them with respect to the imposition of any remedial actions, conditions or limitations on our business operations, is generally not within our control. We also could suffer reputational harm in the event of any perceived or actual noncompliance with certain laws and regulations. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Other litigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities. 
 Our business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally. This focus has only intensified since the latest financial crisis and due to COVID-19 pandemic and related federal and state government responses, with regulators and prosecutors focusing on a variety of financial institution practices and requirements, including our origination and servicing of PPP loans and granting of deferments under the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications by Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus. We may, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business. Legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, depending on, among other factors, the level of our earnings for that period and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The FDIC s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could materially and adversely affect us. 
 The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. In October 2022, FDIC issued a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate by two basis points for all insured depository institutions beginning in 2023. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially and adversely affect us, including reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. 
 54 

The Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our subsidiary bank. 
 As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve, which examines us and our subsidiaries, expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under this requirement, we could be required to provide financial assistance to Customers Bank or any other subsidiary banks we may own in the future should they experience financial distress. 
 A capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore, we may be required to borrow the funds or raise additional equity capital from third parties. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its indebtedness. Any financing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection may be difficult and expensive and may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, which likely would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We are subject to stringent capital requirements which may adversely impact return on equity, require additional capital raises, or limit the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. 
 In September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced an agreement to a strengthened set of capital requirements for internationally active banking organizations in the United States and around the world, known as Basel III. Basel III narrowed the definition of capital, introduced requirements for minimum Tier 1 common capital, increased requirements for minimum Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital, and changed risk-weighting methodologies. Basel III was fully phased in by January 1, 2019. 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule regarding new capital requirements pursuant to Basel III. These rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, for community banks, increased the required amount of regulatory capital that we must hold, and failure to comply with the capital rules will lead to limitations on the dividend payments to us by Customers Bank and other elective distributions. 
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III regulatory framework (commonly referred to as Basel IV). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee s standardized approach for credit risk and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards generally became effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced-approaches institutions and not to us. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators. 
 We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. 
 The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the DOJ, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions (such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans), which could materially and adversely affect us. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. 
 55 

Federal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business. 
 Federal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered predatory. These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make. 
 Loans that we make through certain federal programs are dependent on the Federal Government s continuation and support of these programs and on our compliance with their requirements . 
 We participate in various U.S. Government agency guarantee programs, including PPP and other programs operated by the SBA. We are responsible for following all applicable U.S. Government agency regulations, guidelines and policies whenever we originate loans as part of these guarantee programs. If we or any third-party service providers we have engaged to assist us with such programs fail to follow any applicable regulations, guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, any loans we originate as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee, exposing us to credit risk to which we would not otherwise have been exposed or underwritten as part of our origination process for U.S. Government agency guaranteed loans, or result in our inability to continue originating loans under such programs. The loss of any guarantees for loans we have extended under U.S. Government agency guarantee programs or the loss of our ability to participate in such programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Taxes 
 Reviews performed by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the fiscal years that remain open for investigation may result in a change to income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of various states primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Generally, Customers is no longer subject to examination by federal, state, and local taxing authorities for years prior to the year ended December 31, 2019, with the exception of New York State and New York City. In January 2023, Customers settled the audit examination with New York State to which a reserve for an uncertain tax position was recognized at December 31, 2022. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease over the next twelve months due to the completion of tax authorities' examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitations. While the net effect on the total unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months cannot be reasonably estimated, Customers expects a 1.3 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits in 2023 due to the settlement of the New York State examination, of which 0.6 million will affect the effective tax rate. Customers is currently under audit by New York City for the 2016-2017 tax years. The result of the review could result in increased recognition of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements as well as possible fines and penalties. 
 Changes in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance. 
 We are subject to changes in tax law that could increase Customers' effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect Customers' current and future financial performance. In December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to the Code. The Tax Act reduced Customers' Federal corporate income tax rate to 21 beginning in 2018. However, the Tax Act also imposed limitations on Customers' ability to take certain deductions, such as the deduction for FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which partially offset the increase in net income from the lower tax rate. 
 In addition, a number of the changes to the Code were introduced through the CARES Act and the CAA, and some of the provisions are set to expire in future years. There is substantial uncertainty concerning whether those expiring provisions will be extended, or whether future legislation will further revise the Code. Also, the current administration has indicated it may propose increases to the federal corporate statutory tax rate. An increase in the federal corporate tax rate may increase our tax provision expense. We are unable to predict whether these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. 
 56 

We are Subject to Regulatory Restrictions on Transactions with Our Affiliates and Related Parties. Failure to Comply with Such Regulations Could Materially and Adversely Affect Us. 
 There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the Company may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with the Bank or their respective affiliates and related parties. Under the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve s Regulation W, the Bank is subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit (including credit exposure arising from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions), purchases of assets, and certain other transactions with the Company or its other affiliates. Additionally, transactions between the Bank, on the one hand, and the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand, are required to be on arm s length terms. Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness. The Bank has had, and may be expected to have in the future, banking and other business transactions in the ordinary course of business with affiliates of the Company and the Bank, and their respective executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, their immediate families and affiliated companies (commonly referred to as related parties). The failure of the Company or the Bank to comply with the regulatory restrictions applicable to Customers and the Bank could materially and adversely affect the Company and the Bank. 
 Risks Related to Our Securities 
 Risks Related to Our Voting Common Stock 
 The trading volume in our common stock may generally be less than that of other larger financial services companies. 
 Although the shares of our common stock are listed on the NYSE, the trading volume in our common stock may generally be less than that of many other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time, which presence will be dependent upon the individual decisions of investors, over which we have no control. Illiquidity of the stock market, or in the trading of our common stock on the NYSE, could have a material adverse effect on the value of your shares, particularly if significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of significant sales, were to occur. 
 We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations. 
 We have not historically declared nor paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not expect to do so in the near future. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock, our planned growth in assets and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. We must be current in the payment of dividends to holders of our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock before any dividends can be paid on our common stock. 
 In addition, as a bank holding company, we are subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash and in-kind dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, which, depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time, could include the payment of dividends. Further, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us as its holding company without regulatory approval. See Market Price of Common Stock and Dividends Dividends on Common Stock below for further detail regarding restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. 
 We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future which could adversely affect the value or voting power of our outstanding common stock. 
 Actual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the future could cause the value of our common stock to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our common stock in the future also would, and the issuance of any equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders prior to such issuance. Actual issuances of our common stock could also significantly dilute the voting power of the common stock. 
 We have also made grants of restricted stock units and stock options with respect to shares of our common stock to our directors and certain team members. We may also issue further equity-based awards in the future. As such shares are issued upon vesting and as such options may be exercised and the underlying shares are or become freely tradeable, the value or voting power of our common stock may be adversely affected, and our ability to sell more equity or equity-related securities could also be adversely affected. 
 57 

We are not required to issue any additional equity securities to existing holders of our common stock on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional common stock issuances, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities, warrants or options, will generally dilute the holdings of our existing holders of common stock, and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our common stock. Our outstanding preferred stock has preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital-raising efforts is uncertain. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the value of our common stock. 
 Future issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation, and future issuances of equity securities, which would dilute the holdings of our existing holders of common stock and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of making distributions, periodically or upon liquidation, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 
 In the future, we may issue additional debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings. Upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before holders of our common stock. If we incur debt in the future, our future interest costs could increase and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of us, which could discourage transactions that would otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders and could entrench management. 
 Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Pennsylvania law and the federal CBCA may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of our business through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method even though some of our shareholders might believe a change in control is desirable. They might also increase the costs of completing a transaction in which we acquire another financial services business, merge with another financial institution or sell our business to another financial institution. These increased costs could reduce the value of the shares held by our shareholders upon completion of these types of transactions. 
 Shareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us and our bank subsidiaries, which could impose prior approval requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders. 
 We are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Any entity (including a group composed of natural persons) owning 25 or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock, or a lesser percentage if such holder or group otherwise exercises a controlling influence over us, may be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the BHC Act. In addition, (i) any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to acquire or retain 5 or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock and (ii) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain prior regulatory approval under the CBCA to acquire or retain 10 or more of our outstanding shares of voting stock. Any shareholder that is deemed to control the company for bank regulatory purposes would become subject to prior approval requirements and ongoing regulation and supervision. Such a holder may be required to divest amounts equal to or exceeding 5 of the voting shares of investments that may be deemed incompatible with bank holding company status, such as an investment in a company engaged in non-financial activities. Regulatory determination of control of a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements. 
 Our common stock owned by holders determined by a bank regulatory agency to be acting in concert would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether those holders have control of a bank or bank holding company. Each shareholder obtaining control that is a company would be required to register as a bank holding company. Acting in concert generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Many factors can lead to a finding of acting in concert, including where: (i) the shareholders are commonly controlled or managed; (ii) the shareholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company; (iii) the shareholders each own stock in a bank and are also management officials, controlling shareholders, partners or trustees of another company or (iv) both a shareholder and a controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such shareholder own equity in the bank or bank holding company. 
 58 

Our directors and executive officers can influence the outcome of shareholder votes and, in some cases, shareholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate and affect the investment decision regarding potential investment, acquisition or disposition transactions. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our directors and executive officers, as a group, owned a total of 1,912,564 shares of common stock and exercisable options to purchase up to an additional 726,788 shares of common stock, which potentially gives them, as a group, the ability to control approximately 8.15 of the outstanding common stock. In addition, a director of Customers Bank who is not a director or executive officer of Customers Bancorp owns an additional 13,000 shares of common stock, which if combined with the directors and executive officers of Customers Bancorp, potentially gives them, as a group, the ability to control approximately 8.19 of the outstanding common stock. We believe ownership of stock causes directors and officers to have the same interests as shareholders, but it also gives them the ability to vote as shareholders for matters that are in their personal interest, which may be contrary to the wishes of other shareholders. Shareholders will not necessarily be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more potential investment, acquisition or disposition transactions. Any decision regarding a potential investment or acquisition transaction will be made by our board of directors. Except in limited circumstances as required by applicable law, consummation of an acquisition will not require the approval of holders of common stock. Accordingly, shareholders may not have an opportunity to evaluate and affect the board of directors' decision regarding most potential investment or acquisition transactions and/or certain disposition transactions. 
 The FDIC s policy statement imposing restrictions and criteria on private investors in failed bank acquisitions will apply to us and our investors. 
 In August 2009, the FDIC issued a policy statement imposing restrictions and criteria on private investors in failed bank acquisitions. The policy statement is broad in scope and both complex and potentially ambiguous in its application. In most cases, it would apply to an investor with more than 5 of the total voting power of an acquired depository institution or its holding company; but in certain circumstances, it could apply to investors holding fewer voting shares. The policy statement will be applied to us if we make additional failed bank acquisitions from the FDIC or if the FDIC changes its interpretation of the policy statement or determines at some future date that it should be applied because of our circumstances. 
 Investors subject to the policy statement could be prohibited from selling or transferring their interests for three years. They also would be required to provide the FDIC with information about the investor and all entities in the investor s ownership chain, including information on the size of the capital fund or funds, its diversification, its return profile, its marketing documents, and its management team and business model. Investors owning 80 or more of two or more banks or savings associations would be required to pledge their proportionate interests in each institution to cross-guarantee the FDIC against losses to the DIF. 
 Under the policy statement, the FDIC also could prohibit investment through ownership structures involving multiple investment vehicles that are owned or controlled by the same parent company. Investors that directly or indirectly hold 10 or more of the equity of a bank or savings association in receivership also would not be eligible to bid to become investors in the deposit liabilities of that failed institution. In addition, an investor using ownership structures with entities that are domiciled in bank-secrecy jurisdictions would not be eligible to own a direct or indirect interest in an insured depository institution unless the investor s parent company is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision as recognized by the Federal Reserve, and the investor enters into certain agreements with the U.S. bank regulators regarding access to information, maintenance of records and compliance with U.S. banking laws and regulations. If the policy statement applies, we (including any failed bank we acquire) could be required to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to total assets of at least 10 for a period of three years and thereafter maintain a capital level sufficient to be well capitalized under regulatory standards during the remaining period of ownership of the investors. Bank subsidiaries also may be prohibited from extending any new credit to investors that own at least 10 of our equity. 
 Risks Related to Our Fixed-to-Floating-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E and Series F 
 The shares of our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are equity securities and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness. 
 The shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are equity interests in Customers Bancorp and do not constitute indebtedness of Customers Bancorp or any of our subsidiaries and rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding. 
 59 

We may not pay dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. 
 Dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are payable only if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. As a bank holding company, we are subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, which, depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time, could include the payment of dividends. Further, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us as its holding company without regulatory approval. 
 Dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are non-cumulative. 
 Dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are payable only when, as and if authorized and declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. Consequently, if our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period, holders of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive any such dividend, and such unpaid dividend will cease to accrue or be payable. If we do not declare and pay dividends on the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, the market prices of the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may decline. 
 Our ability to pay dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock is dependent on dividends and distributions we receive from our subsidiaries, which are subject to regulatory and other limitations. 
 Our principal source of cash flow is dividends from Customers Bank. We cannot assure you that Customers Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to us. If Customers Bank fails to make dividend payments or other permitted distributions to us, and sufficient cash is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments on the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. Various federal and state statutes, regulations and rules limit, directly or indirectly, the amount of dividends that our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In particular, dividend and other distributions from Customers Bank to us would require notice to or approval of the applicable regulatory authority. There can be no assurances that we would receive such approval. 
 In addition, our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or otherwise, and, as a result, the ability of a holder of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of preferred equity holders and creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, shares of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and any outstanding preferred equity of our subsidiaries. 
 Holders of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock should not expect us to redeem their shares when they first become redeemable at our option or on any particular date thereafter, and our ability to redeem the shares will be subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
 Our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are perpetual equity securities, meaning that they have no maturity date or mandatory redemption date, and the shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders thereof. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock. However, any determination we make at any time to propose a redemption of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will depend upon a number of factors, including our evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our shareholders equity and general market conditions at that time. In addition, our right to redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock is subject to any limitations established by the Federal Reserve. Under the Federal Reserve s risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will approve any such redemption. 
 We may be able to redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock before their initial redemption dates upon a regulatory capital treatment event. 
 We may be able to redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock before their respective initial redemption dates, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain events involving the capital treatment of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, as applicable. In particular, upon our determination in good faith that an event has occurred that would constitute a regulatory capital treatment event, with respect to a particular series of the preferred stock, we may redeem that particular series of securities in whole, but not in part, upon the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
 60 

Holders of Series E and Series F Preferred stock have limited voting rights. 
 Holders of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting shareholders. However, holders of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will have the right to vote in the event of non-payments of dividends under certain circumstances, with respect to authorizing classes or series of preferred stock senior to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, as applicable, and with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, as applicable, or as otherwise required by law. 
 General market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices for the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. 
 There can be no assurance regarding the market prices for the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could influence the market prices, including: 
 whether we declare or fail to declare dividends on the series of preferred stock from time to time; 
 our operating performance, financial condition and prospects or the operating performance, financial condition and prospects of our competitors; 
 real or anticipated changes in the credit ratings (if any) assigned to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock or our other securities; 
 our creditworthiness; 
 changes in interest rates and expectations regarding changes in rates; 
 our issuance of additional preferred equity; 
 the market for similar securities; 
 developments in the securities, credit and housing markets, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and 
 economic, financial, corporate, securities market, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that affect us, the banking industry or the financial markets generally. 
 The Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may not have an active trading market. 
 Although the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are listed on the NYSE, an active trading market may not be established or maintained for the shares, and transaction costs could be high. As a result, the difference between bid and ask prices in any secondary market could be substantial. 
 The Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may be junior or equal in rights and preferences to preferred stock we may issue in the future. 
 Our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock rank equally. Although we do not currently have outstanding preferred stock that ranks senior to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may rank junior to other preferred stock we may issue in the future that by its terms is expressly senior in rights and preferences to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, although the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of the affected class of preferred stock is required to issue any shares of stock ranking senior in rights and preferences to such class. Any preferred stock that ranks senior to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock in the future would have priority in payment of dividends and the making of distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Customers Bancorp. Additional issuances by us of preferred stock ranking equally with Series E and Series F Preferred Stock do not generally require the approval of holders of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. 
 61 

We intend to calculate the floating rate dividends payable on our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock based on three-month SOFR instead of three-month LIBOR. 
 The dividend rate on our Series E Preferred Stock is currently a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the related dividend determination date plus a spread of 5.14 . The dividend rate on our Series F Preferred Stock is currently a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the related dividend determination date plus a spread of 4.762 . As a result of the winding-down of the use of LIBOR as a financial benchmark, in July 2023, on the date for payment of dividends on our Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, we will calculate the dividends payable on shares of our Series E Preferred Stock based on a floating rate per annum equal to three-month SOFR as determined on the related dividend determination date plus a spread of 5.14 and the dividends payable on shares of our Series F Preferred Stock based on a floating rate per annum equal to three-month SOFR as determined on the related dividend determination date plus a spread of 4.762 . 
 SOFR has a very limited history, and its historical performance is not indicative of future performance. The Federal Reserve began to publish SOFR in April 2018; therefore, SOFR has limited performance history and no actual investment based on the performance of SOFR was possible before April 2018. The level of SOFR during the floating rate period for our Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock may bear little or no relation to the historical level of SOFR. Furthermore, the future performance of SOFR is impossible to predict and, as a result, no future performance of SOFR or our Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock may be inferred from any historical performance data. Changes in the levels of SOFR will affect the return on, and trading price of, our Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, but it is impossible to predict whether such levels will rise or fall. Since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as U.S. dollar LIBOR, during corresponding periods. 
 The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of U.S. dollar LIBOR and any failure of SOFR to gain market acceptance could adversely affect the Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock. SOFR was developed for use in certain U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts as an alternative to the U.S. dollar LIBOR in part because it is considered representative of general funding conditions in the overnight Treasury repo market. However, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does not measure bank-specific credit risk and, as a result, is less likely to correlate with the unsecured short-term funding costs of banks. In addition, SOFR is an overnight rate, while U.S. dollar LIBOR represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as U.S. dollar LIBOR would have at any time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. The differences between SOFR and U.S. dollar LIBOR may mean that market participants would not consider SOFR a suitable substitute or successor for all of the purposes for which U.S. dollar LIBOR historically has been used, which may, in turn, lessen market acceptance of SOFR. If SOFR does not prove to be widely used in securities that are similar or comparable to the Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, the trading price of those securities may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes 
 Our 2.875 Senior Notes, 4.5 Senior Notes, 6.125 Subordinated Notes and 5.375 Subordinated Notes contain limited covenants. 
 The terms of our 2.875 Senior Notes and 4.5 Senior Notes, which we refer to as the Senior Notes, and 6.125 and 5.375 Subordinated Notes, which we refer to as the Subordinated Notes, generally do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or other liabilities. If we incur additional debt or liabilities, our ability to pay our obligations on the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes could be adversely affected. In addition, the terms of our Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes do not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flows or liquidity and, accordingly, do not protect holders of those notes in the event that we experience material adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations. Holders of the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes also have limited protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, default under our existing indebtedness, restructuring, merger or similar transaction. 
 Our ability to make interest and principal payments on the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes is dependent on dividends and distributions we receive from our subsidiaries, which are subject to regulatory and other limitations. 
 Our principal source of cash flow is dividends from Customers Bank. We cannot assure you that Customers Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to us. If Customers Bank fails to make dividend payments to us, and sufficient cash is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make interest and principal payments on the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes. Various federal and state statutes, regulations and rules limit, directly or indirectly, the amount of dividends that our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In particular, dividend and other distributions from Customers Bank to us would require notice to or approval of the applicable regulatory authority. There can be no assurances that we would receive such approval. 
 62 

In addition, our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or otherwise, and, as a result, the ability of a holder of the 2.875 Senior Notes and 4.5 Senior Notes to benefit indirectly from such distribution will be subject to the prior claims of preferred equity holders and creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, the 2.875 Senior Notes and 4.5 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and any outstanding preferred equity of our subsidiaries. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes. 
 Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes will depend on our financial and operating performance, including dividends payable to us from Customers Bank, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. 
 If our cash flows and capital resources and dividends from Customers Bank are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be unable to provide new loans, other products or to fund our obligations to existing customers and otherwise implement our business plans. As a result, we may be unable to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations or seek to restructure our indebtedness, including the notes. We may not be able to consummate these transactions, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations when due. 
 The Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes are our unsecured obligations. The Senior Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of our secured and unsecured senior indebtedness and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our subordinated indebtedness. Although the Senior Notes are senior notes, they will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. Because the Senior Notes are unsecured, they will be effectively subordinated to all of our future secured senior indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 
 The Subordinated Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of our secured and unsecured subordinated indebtedness and will rank junior in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. As is the case with the Senior Notes, the Subordinated Notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. Because the Subordinated Notes are unsecured, they will be effectively subordinated to all of our future secured subordinated indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 
 The Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes may not have an active trading market. 
 The Senior Notes and 6.125 Subordinated Notes are not listed on any securities exchange, and there is no active trading market for these notes. Although the 5.375 Subordinated Notes are listed on the NYSE, there is no guarantee that a trading market will develop or be maintained. In addition to the other factors described below, the lack of a trading market for the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes may adversely affect the holder s ability to sell the notes and the prices at which the notes may be sold. 
 The prices realizable from sales of the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes in any secondary market also will be affected by the supply and demand of the notes, the interest rate, the ranking and a number of other factors, including: 
 yields on U.S. Treasury obligations and expectations about future interest rates; 
 actual or anticipated changes in our financial condition or results, including our levels of indebtedness; 
 general economic conditions and expectations regarding the effects of national policies; 
 investors views of securities issued by both holding companies and similar financial service firms; and 
 the market for similar securities. 
 63 

General Risk Factors 
 Downgrades in U.S. government and federal agency securities could adversely affect us. 
 The long-term impact of the downgrade of the U.S. government and federal agencies from an AAA to an AA+ credit rating is still uncertain. However, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, the downgrade, and any future downgrades and/or failures to raise the U.S. debt limit if necessary in the future, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities owned by us, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition. In particular, it could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed-income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect profitability. Also, the adverse consequences as a result of the downgrade could extend to the borrowers of the loans we make and, as a result, could adversely affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans. 
 We may not be able to maintain consistent earnings or profitability. 
 Although we made profit for the years 2011 through 2022, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent or increase in the future. Our earnings also may be reduced by increased expenses associated with increased assets, such as additional team member compensation expense, and increased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund increases in assets. If earnings do not grow proportionately with our assets or equity, our overall profitability may be adversely affected.

 Item 5. Market For Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Trading Market for Common Stock 
 Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol CUBI. 
 As of February 24, 2023, there were approximately 309 registered shareholders of Customers Bancorp's common stock. Certain shares are held in nominee or street name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing number. 
 Dividends on Common Stock 
 Customers Bancorp historically has not paid any cash dividends on its shares of common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. 
 Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of Customers Bancorp s Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock, including obligations to pay dividends to the holders of Customers Bancorp's issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. 
 In addition, as a bank holding company, Customers Bancorp is subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, which, depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time, could include the payment of dividends. Further, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that bank subsidiaries can pay to their parent holding company without regulatory approval. Generally, subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends when doing so would cause them to fall below the regulatory minimum capital levels, and limits exist on paying dividends in excess of net income for specified periods. 
 Beginning January 1, 2015, the ability to pay dividends and the amounts that can be paid will be limited to the extent the Bank's capital ratios do not exceed the minimum required levels plus 250 basis points, as these requirements were phased in through January 1, 2019. See "Item 1, Business - Federal Banking Laws" for more information relating to restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Bancorp and the Bancorp's payment of dividends. 
 Special Dividends of BM Technologies, Inc. Common Stock 
 On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the previously announced divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Customers Bank, to MFAC Merger Sub Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MFAC, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 6, 2020, as amended, by and among MFAC, MFAC Merger Sub Inc., BMT, Customers Bank and Customers Bancorp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. and began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "BMTX". 
 Customers received cash consideration of 23.1 million upon closing of the divestiture, and 3.7 million of additional cash consideration in May 2021. Upon closing of the divestiture, holders of Customers common stock who held their Customers shares as of the close of business on December 18, 2020 received an aggregate of 4,876,387 shares of BM Technologies' common stock in the form of special dividend. Each holder of Customers common stock was entitled to receive 0.15389 shares of BM Technologies' common stock for each share of Customers common stock held as of the close of business on December 18, 2020. No fractional shares of BM Technologies' common stock were issued; fractional share otherwise issuable were rounded to the nearest whole share. Certain team members of BMT also received 1,348,748 shares of BM Technologies' common stock as severance.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On August 25, 2021, the Board of Directors of Customers Bancorp authorized the Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to 3,235,326 shares of the Company's common stock (representing 10 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock on June 30, 2021). The term of the Share Repurchase Program was extended for one additional year to September 27, 2023, unless earlier terminated.

 Overview 
 Like most financial institutions, Customers derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans, leases and investments. Customers' primary source of funds for making these loans, leases and investments are its deposits and borrowings, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of Customers' success is the amount of its net interest income, or the difference between the interest income on its interest-earning assets and the interest expense on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, relative to the amount of average interest-earning assets, which is referred to as net interest margin. 
 BankMobile, previously a division of Customers Bank, derived a majority of its revenue from interest income on installment loans, interchange and card revenue and deposit fees. On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, through a merger with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. All of BankMobile s serviced deposits and loans including the related net interest income remained with Customers Bank after the divestiture. Beginning in first quarter 2021, BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture are reflected in Customers Bancorp s results of operations as discontinued operations. As a result of the divestiture, Customers' interchange income, deposit account fees and subscription fees decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Customers' non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, technology, professional services, merger and acquisition related expenses and other non-interest expenses, including reimbursements from the white label relationship associated with BMT decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 In connection with the divestiture, Customers entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers incurred expenses of 57.0 million and 59.5 million to BM Technologies under the deposit servicing agreement, included within the technology, communication and bank operations expense in the income from continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers held 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers currently expects that approximately half of these serviced deposits will leave Customers Bank by the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of such deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. The deposit service agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. Customers and BM Technologies also agreed to remove Customers' obligation under the deposit servicing agreement to pay BM Technologies the interchange maintenance fee which is the difference between the Durbin-exempt and Durbin-recalculated interchange revenues. The other terms of the deposit servicing agreement remain in effect through the new termination date. Customers and BM Technologies are currently negotiating an extension of this agreement with respect to the serviced deposits expected to remain at Customers Bank after June 30, 2023. The loan agreement with BM Technologies was terminated early in November 2021. The transition services agreement with BM Technologies, as amended, expired on March 31, 2022. Customers entered into a special limited agency agreement with BM Technologies, whereby Customers originates consumer installment loans referred by BM Technologies for an initial period from April 20, 2022 to December 31, 2022, and renews annually unless terminated by either party. For additional information, refer to "NOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 In 2021, Customers Bank launched CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, which serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments, including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and other B2B verticals. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the instant B2B payments platform by maintaining U.S. dollars in deposit accounts at Customers Bank. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank held 2.3 billion and 1.9 billion of deposits from customers participating in CBIT, respectively. 
 68 

The CBIT instant payments platform provides a closed-system for intrabank commercial transactions and is not intended to be a trading platform for tokens or digital assets. CBIT tokens are used only in connection with the CBIT instant payments platform and are not securities for purposes of applicable securities laws. There are no scenarios in which the transaction or redemption value of one CBIT would not be equal to one U.S. dollar. Each CBIT is minted with precisely one U.S. dollar equivalent, and those dollars are held in a non-interest bearing omnibus deposit account until the CBIT is burned or redeemed. The number of CBIT outstanding in the CBIT instant payments platform is always equal to the U.S. dollars held in the omnibus deposit account at Customers Bank and is reported as a deposit liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The omnibus deposit account had an outstanding balance of 23 thousand at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. 
 There is credit risk inherent in loans and leases requiring Customers to maintain an ACL to absorb credit losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible. Customers maintains this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses on loans and leases against its operating earnings. Customers has included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing its ACL, in "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" and "NOTE 8 LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Impact of Macroeconomic Uncertainties, COVID-19 and Geopolitical Conflict 
 The spread of COVID-19 and its variants since early 2020 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that Customers serves. Governmental responses during the early stages of the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation including the CARES Act and subsequent amendments and the Federal Reserve maintaining a low interest rate environment. 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. It contained substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included the SBA's PPP, a nearly 350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans were intended to guarantee an eight-week or 24-week period of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. On April 16, 2020, the SBA announced that all available funds had been exhausted and applications were no longer being accepted. On April 22, 2020, an additional 310 billion of funds for the PPP was signed into law. On August 8, 2020, the SBA announced that the PPP was closed and no longer accepting PPP applications from participating lenders. On December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, including Division N, Title III, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, which provided 284 billion in additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAA provided small businesses who received an initial PPP loan and experienced a 25 reduction in gross receipts to request a second PPP loan of up to 2.0 million. On January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP program to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was enacted expanding eligibility for first and second round of PPP loans and revising the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Customers has helped thousands of small businesses by funding over 10 billion in PPP loans directly or through partnerships. Customers had 1.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Customers also implemented a short-term loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of its borrowers who met the program's qualifications. This program allowed for a deferral of payments for a maximum of 90 days at a time. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. On December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, which extended and expanded various relief provisions of the CARES Act including the temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs until January 1, 2022. All commercial loans previously on deferments became current by December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, total consumer deferments were 6.1 million. 
 The Federal Reserve also took a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve established a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19, including among others, the PPPLF, which was created to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP by taking loans as collateral at face value. Customers participated in some of these facilities or programs, primarily the PPPLF. Customers fully repaid the borrowing from the PPPLF during the year ended December 31, 2021. No new advances are available from the PPPLF after July 30, 2021.

The U.S. economy has since strengthened despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, with higher inflation and housing values beginning in 2021. Also, the ongoing global supply chain issues and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine contributed to higher inflation in 2022. In response, the Federal Reserve began normalizing monetary policy with its decision in late 2021 to taper its quantitative easing and raising the federal funds rate beginning in March 2022. Inflation remains elevated in 2022, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to COVID-19 and its variants, higher food and energy prices from the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and broader price pressures. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly throughout 2022 and in the early part of 2023 in attempts to bring the inflation to its long run target rate of two percent. Future rate hikes are expected during the remainder of 2023, as the Federal Reserve has indicated ongoing interest rate increases in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to two percent over time. 
 Significant uncertainties as to future economic conditions continue to exist, including higher inflation, global supply chain issues, and higher oil and commodity prices exacerbated by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Customers has taken deliberate actions in response, including maintaining higher levels of liquidity, reserves for credit losses on loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures and strong capital ratios. Customers has also shifted the mix of its loan portfolio towards low credit risk commercial loans with floating or adjustable interest rates and focused on growing its non-interest bearing and lower-cost interest-bearing deposits to position the Bank for higher interest rates. Customers continues to monitor closely the impact of COVID-19 and its variants, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and macroeconomic uncertainties, as well as any effects that may result from the federal government's responses including future rate hikes; however, the extent to which COVID-19 and its variants, the geopolitical conflict, inflation, interest rates and other macroeconomic factors will impact Customers' operations and financial results in 2023 is highly uncertain. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information about the impact that recently adopted or issued accounting guidance will have on us, refer to "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Customers has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Customers' significant accounting policies are described in "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by Customers that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets. Customers considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions management makes, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of Customers' assets. 
 The critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of Customers' financial condition and results of operations and require complex, subjective judgments is the ACL. This critical accounting policy and material estimate, along with the related disclosures, are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Customers' ACL at December 31, 2022 represents Customers' current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan and lease portfolio and its unfunded lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans and leases' expected remaining term. 
 Customers uses external sources in the creation of its forecasts, including current economic conditions and forecasts for macroeconomic variables over its reasonable and supportable forecast period (e.g., GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, BBB spread, commercial real estate and home price index). After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which ranges from two to five years, the models revert the forecasted macroeconomic variables to their historical long-term trends, without specific predictions for the economy, over the expected life of the pool, while also incorporating prepayment assumptions into its lifetime loss rates. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. Significant loan/borrower attributes utilized in the models include property type, initial loan to value, assigned risk ratings, delinquency status, origination date, maturity date, initial FICO scores, and borrower industry and state. 
 70 

The ACL may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that Customers considers to reflect its current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures, including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modelled credit loss estimates, nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio, credit underwriting policy exceptions, peer comparison, industry data, and model and data limitations. The qualitative allowance for economic forecast risk is further informed by multiple alternative scenarios, as deemed applicable, to arrive at a scenario or a composite of scenarios supporting the period-end ACL balance. The evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to changes, sometimes materially and rapidly. Customers recognizes that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments such that additional analysis may be performed at management's discretion. Due in part to its subjectivity, the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events that could lead to revision of reserves to reflect management's best estimate of expected credit losses. 
 The ACL is established in accordance with our ACL policy. The ACL Committee, which includes the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Lending Officer, and Chief Credit Officer, among others, reviews the adequacy of the ACL each quarter, together with Customers' risk management team. The ACL policy, significant judgments and the related disclosures are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 The net decrease in our estimated ACL as of December 31, 2022 as compared to our December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from the sale of consumer installment loans to a third-party sponsored VIE, partially offset by loan growth, deteriorating macroeconomic forecasts and increases in charge-offs primarily attributed to 11.0 million in commercial and industrial loans originated under the PPP that were subsequently determined to be ineligible for SBA forgiveness and guarantee and ultimately deemed uncollectible, a partial charge-off of 7.9 million for a performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan that Customers decided to exit, and higher charge-offs in consumer installment loans and overdrawn deposit accounts. Refer to NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES to Customers' audited financial statements for more information on the sale of consumer installment loans. The provision for credit losses on loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 59.5 million, for an ending ACL balance of 133.9 million 130.9 million for loans and leases and 3.0 million for unfunded lending-related commitments) as of December 31, 2022. 
 To determine the ACL as of December 31, 2022, Customers utilized the Moody's December 2022 Baseline forecast to generate its modelled expected losses and considered Moody's other alternative economic forecast scenarios to qualitatively adjust the modelled ACL by loan portfolio in order to reflect management's reasonable expectations of current and future economic conditions. The Baseline forecast at December 31, 2022 assumed lower growth rates in macroeconomic forecasts compared to the macroeconomic forecasts used by Customers in 2021; oil prices remaining volatile, but gradually declining by mid-2023, recession fears, weakening global economies and the embargo on Russian crude oil from the Russian invasion of Ukraine; COVID-19 becoming less disruptive to global supply chains, tourism and business travel, immigration and labor markets; the Federal Reserve raising the effective fed funds rate to just under 5.0 and cutting the fed funds rate beginning in late 2023 and throughout 2024; the CPI rising 4.1 in 2023 and 2.4 in 2024; and the unemployment rate rising to 4.0 in 2023 and 4.1 in 2024. Customers continues to monitor the impact of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, COVID-19 and its variants, supply-chain disruptions, inflation, and related policy measures on the economy and, if the pace of the expected recovery is worse than expected, further meaningful provisions for credit losses could be required. 
 The net decrease in our estimated ACL as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to the continued improvement in macroeconomic forecasts since the significant economic impact of COVID-19 in early 2020, partially offset by loan growth primarily in Customers' consumer installment loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses on loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 27.4 million, for an ending ACL balance of 139.9 million 137.8 million for loans and leases and 2.1 million for unfunded lending-related commitments) as of December 31, 2021. To determine the ACL as of December 31, 2021, Customers utilized the Moody's December 2021 Baseline forecast to generate its modelled expected losses by loan portfolio in order to reflect management's reasonable expectations of current and future economic conditions. The Moody's Baseline forecast at December 31, 2021 assumed continued improvement in forecasts of macroeconomic conditions compared to the forecasts of macroeconomic conditions used by Customers in 2020; the Federal Reserve has accelerated its tapering process in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first rate hike is assumed to occur in 2022; a continuing U.S. economic recovery from federal spending and abatement of the COVID-19 pandemic, notwithstanding the impact of the Omicron variant; and the acceleration in consumer prices is expected to peak and moderate in the near-term as the supply chain issues subside. 
 71 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macroeconomic forecasts from Moody's. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within Customers' modelling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100 weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around the supply-chain conditions worsening and higher wage increases adding to inflation pressures; new infections, hospitalizations and COVID-19 deaths rising significantly again as compared to the Baseline projections, slowing growth in consumer spending on air travel, retail and hotels; the Federal Reserve raising interest rates higher than the Baseline projections; rising unemployment; and the U.S. economy falling into recession in 2023. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate is estimated at 6.8 and 7.4 in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These numbers represent a 2.8 and 3.3 higher unemployment estimate than Baseline scenario projections of 4.0 and 4.1 , respectively, for the same time periods. To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters, management calculated the difference between a 100 Baseline weighting and a 100 adverse scenario weighting for modelled results. This would result in an incremental quantitative impact to the ACL of approximately 42.2 million at December 31, 2022. This resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in ACL levels since (i) Customers may use a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its ACL process, (ii) the highly uncertain economic environment, (iii) the difficulty in predicting inter-relationships between macroeconomic variables used in various economic scenarios, and (iv) the sensitivity analysis does not account for any qualitative adjustments incorporated by Customers as part of its overall ACL framework. 
 There is no certainty that Customers' ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or Customers' markets, such as geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation including a near-term recession, or 
 the emergence of a more contagious and severe COVID-19 variant, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of Customers' customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, Customers' net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on Customers' financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability, risks of rising inflation and COVID-19 and its variants have and will continue to negatively impact Customers' businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time.

The following table sets forth the condensed statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: For the Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Change Net interest income 623,720 685,074 (61,354) (9.0) Provision for credit losses 60,066 27,426 32,640 119.0 Total non-interest income 32,272 77,867 (45,595) (58.6) Total non-interest expense 304,629 294,307 10,322 3.5 Income before income tax expense 291,297 441,208 (149,911) (34.0) Income tax expense 63,263 86,940 (23,677) (27.2) Net income from continuing operations 228,034 354,268 (126,234) (35.6) Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes (20,354) 20,354 (100.0) Income tax expense (benefit) from discontinued operations 19,267 (19,267) (100.0) Net loss from discontinued operations (39,621) 39,621 (100.0) Net income 228,034 314,647 (86,613) (27.5) Preferred stock dividends 9,632 11,693 (2,061) (17.6) Loss on redemption of preferred stock 2,820 (2,820) (100.0) Net income available to common shareholders 218,402 300,134 (81,732) (27.2) 
 Customers reported net income available to common shareholders of 218.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Factors contributing to the change in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows: 
 Net interest income 
 Net interest income decreased 61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as interest income from PPP loans decreased due to lower levels of PPP loan forgiveness, which accelerated the recognition of net deferred loan origination fees, offset in part by an increase in commercial and industrial loans and leases, primarily in specialty lending. Average interest-earning assets increased by 1.0 billion, and NIM decreased by 51 basis points to 3.19 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 3.70 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial loans and leases, primarily in specialty lending, investment securities, multifamily loans, consumer installment loans and residential mortgages, offset in part by decreases in PPP loans due to PPP loan forgiveness and commercial loans to mortgage companies. The PPP loan forgiveness, which accelerated the recognition of net deferred loan origination fees, decreased in 2022. The commercial loans to mortgage companies decreased as the mortgage activity decelerated due to rising interest rates in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets in a rising interest rate environment mostly in commercial and industrial loans and leases, primarily in specialty lending and by equity investment distributions, which are included in other interest income. The shift in the mix of interest-earning assets in a rising interest rate environment included 7.4 billion in ending balance 5.9 billion average balance) of commercial and industrial loans and leases yielding 4.88 at and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included secured and variable rate loans in specialty lending and owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and 1.0 billion in ending balance 1.7 billion average balance) of PPP loans yielding 4.60 at and for the year December 31, 2022. The shift in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities in a rising interest rate environment drove an 88 basis point increase in the cost of deposits and borrowings, which more than offset the increase in yield from interest-earning assets, and contributed to the NIM decrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The shift in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities included interest-bearing deposits of 16.3 billion in ending balance 13.5 billion average balance) costing 1.67 at and for the year December 31, 2022. Non-interest bearing demand deposits were 1.9 billion in ending balance 3.8 billion average balance) at and for the year December 31, 2022. Customers' total cost of deposits, including interest-bearing and non-interest bearing deposits, were 1.31 and 0.44 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. PPPLF borrowings costing 0.35 were fully repaid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Customers' total cost of funds, including non-interest bearing deposits and borrowings, was 1.42 and 0.54 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Provision for credit losses 
 The 32.6 million increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects the loan growth and deteriorating macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by sale of consumer installment loans to a third-party sponsored VIE. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information on the sale of consumer installment loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is presented within accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the related provision is presented as part of other non-interest expense on the consolidated statement of income. The ACL on loans and leases held for investment, represented 0.93 of total loans and leases receivable and 1.00 of total loans and leases receivable, excluding PPP loans (a non-GAAP measure, please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation within Loans and Leases, Credit Risk ), at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.12 and 1.53 (a non-GAAP measure, please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation within Loans and Leases, Credit Risk at December 31, 2021. 
 Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 66.4 million, or 45 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to 33.8 million, or 22 basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to 11.0 million in commercial and industrial loans originated under the PPP that were subsequently determined to be ineligible for SBA forgiveness and guarantee and ultimately deemed uncollectible, a partial charge-off of 7.9 million for a performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan that Customers decided to exit, higher charge-offs of consumer installment loans and overdrawn deposit accounts. 
 The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 also included a provision for credit losses of 0.6 million on certain asset-backed securities included in our investment securities available for sale. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 Non-interest income 
 The 45.6 million decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from 23.5 million of losses from the sales of 521.8 million of consumer installment loans, inclusive of accrued interest and unamortized deferred loan origination costs, to a third-party sponsored VIE, and decreases of 54.6 million in net gains realized from the sale of AFS debt securities, 8.2 million in gains from the sales of SBA and other loans, 6.1 million in mortgage warehouse transactional fees, 3.4 million in unrealized gain on investment securities and 1.7 million in other non-interest income. These decreases were offset in part by losses of 24.5 million on cash flow hedge derivative terminations and 2.8 million on sale of foreign subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2021, 7.5 million in legal settlement gain, and increases of 7.3 million in bank-owned life insurance income, 6.6 million in commercial lease income and 4.7 million in loans fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information on the sale of consumer installment loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Non-interest expense 
 The 10.3 million increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from increases of 5.2 million in commercial lease depreciation, 4.3 million in loan servicing, 4.2 million in salaries and employee benefits, 1.5 million in occupancy, 1.5 million in technology, communication and bank operations, 1.0 million in advertising and promotion, 0.8 million in loan workout related expenses and 0.8 million in professional services. These increases were offset in part by decreases of 6.2 million in deposit relationship adjustment fees, 1.2 million in FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees, 1.0 million in other non-interest expense and 0.4 million in merger and acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Income tax expense 
 Customers' effective tax rate was 21.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 19.7 for the year the ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the recognition of uncertain tax positions in 2022, a decrease in tax credit benefits, recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the outside basis difference of foreign subsidiaries in 2021 and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in 2021, partially offset by increases in death benefits from bank-owned life insurance policies in 2022.

Net loss from discontinued operations 
 On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BMT, the technology arm of its BankMobile segment, to MFAC Merger Sub Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MFAC, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 6, 2020, by and among MFAC, MFAC Merger Sub Inc., BMT, Customers Bank, the sole stockholder of BMT, and Customers Bancorp, the parent bank holding company for Customers Bank (as amended on November 2, 2020 and December 8, 2020). In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. Following the completion of the divestiture of BMT, BankMobile's serviced deposits and loans and the related net interest income have been combined with Customers' financial condition and the results of operations as a single reportable segment. 
 BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture are reflected in Customers Bancorp s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. BMT's operating results and associated cash flows have been presented as "Discontinued operations" within the accompanying audited financial statements and prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. 
 Customers had no loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 39.6 million decrease primarily resulted from restricted stock awards of BM Technologies' common stock granted to certain team members of BMT and the effect of the divestiture being treated as a taxable asset sale for tax purposes, offset in part by a tax benefit related to the restricted stock awards in 2021. Refer to "NOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 Preferred stock dividends and loss on redemption of preferred stock 
 Preferred stock dividends were 9.6 million and 11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Customers redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock for an aggregate payment of 82.5 million, at a redemption price of 25.00 per share. The redemption price paid in excess of the carrying value of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock of 2.8 million is included as a loss on redemption of preferred stock in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. After giving effect to the redemption, no shares of the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock remained outstanding. There were no changes to the amount of preferred stock outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to "NOTE 13 SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 On June 15, 2021, the Series E Preferred Stock became floating at three-month LIBOR plus 5.14 , compared to a fixed rate of 6.45 . On December 15, 2021, the Series F Preferred Stock became floating at three-month LIBOR plus 4.762 , compared to a fixed rate of 6.00 . Publication of overnight and one-, three-, six , and twelve-month USD LIBOR settings will be discontinued after June 30, 2023. Customers expects that the Series E and F Preferred Stock will pay dividends based on the three-month term SOFR plus spreads comparable to the current spreads after June 30, 2023. 
 
 NET INTEREST INCOME 
 Net interest income (the difference between the interest earned on loans and leases, investments and interest-earning deposits with banks, and interest paid on deposits, borrowed funds and subordinated debt) is the primary source of Customers' earnings. The following table summarizes Customers' net interest income, related interest spread, net interest margin and the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to volume (i.e., changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

Management uses non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule that follows this table. 
 (6) Not Meaningful. Average yield on other interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 15.38 primarily due to 6.4 million of equity investment distributions. 
 76 

Net interest income decreased 61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The average interest-earning assets increased by 1.0 billion, primarily related to increases in commercial and industrial loans and leases, primarily in specialty lending, investment securities, multifamily loans, consumer installment loans and residential mortgages, partially offset by decreases in PPP loans due to PPP loan forgiveness and commercial loans to mortgage companies. Up until late 2021, the commercial loans to mortgage companies trend had largely been a function of greater refinance activity due to sharply lower interest rates, an increase in home purchase volumes and market share gains from other banks since early 2020. The refinancing activity has slowed since reaching its high level in early 2021, and into 2022 with rising interest rates. 
 The NIM decreased by 51 basis points to 3.19 for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 3.70 for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulting primarily from a decrease in PPP loan forgiveness and a shift in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities in a rising interest rate environment, offset in part by a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets in a rising interest rate environment. The PPP loan forgiveness, which accelerated the recognition of net deferred loan origination fees, decreased in 2022. This decrease was partially offset by the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, mostly in commercial and industrial loans and leases, primarily specialty lending, and by equity investment distributions, which are included in other interest income. The shift in the mix of interest-earning assets in a rising interest rate environment included 7.4 billion in ending balance 5.9 billion average balance) of commercial and industrial loans and leases yielding 4.88 at and for the year December 31, 2022, which included secured and variable rate loans in specialty lending and owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and 1.0 billion in ending balance 1.7 billion average balance) of PPP loans yielding 4.60 at and for the year December 31, 2022. The shift in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities in a rising interest rate environment drove an 88 basis point increase in the cost of deposits and borrowings, which more than offset the increase in yield from interest-earning assets, and contributed to the NIM decrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The shift in interest-bearing liabilities included interest-bearing deposits of 16.3 billion in ending balance 13.5 billion average balance) costing 1.67 at and for the year December 31, 2022. Non-interest bearing demand deposits was 1.9 billion in ending balance 3.8 billion average balance) at and for the year December 31, 2022. Customers' total cost of deposits, including interest-bearing and non-interest bearing deposits was 1.31 and 0.44 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. PPPLF borrowings costing 0.35 were fully repaid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Customers' total cost of funds, including non-interest bearing deposits and borrowings was 1.42 and 0.54 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Customers net interest margin table contains non-GAAP financial measures calculated using non-GAAP amounts. These measures include net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the current period presentation to historical periods in prior filings. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 For more information about the provision and Customers' ACL methodology and loss experience, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" and "NOTE 8 LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Customers maintains an ACL to cover current expected credit losses as of the balance sheet date on loans and leases held for investment that are not reported at their fair value on a recurring basis. The ACL is increased through periodic provisions for credit losses on loans and leases that are charged as an expense on the consolidated statements of income and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The loan and lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly to evaluate the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the ACL. The ACL is estimated as of the end of each quarter and compared to the balance recorded in the general ledger, net of charge-offs and recoveries. The allowance is adjusted to the estimated ACL balance with a corresponding charge (or debit) to the provision for credit losses on loans and leases. 
 The provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management s assessment of expected lifetime losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. Customers recorded a provision for credit losses for loans and leases of 59.5 million and 27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers recorded a provision of 0.9 million and a benefit to provision of 0.2 million of lending-related commitments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 32.1 million increase in the provision for credit losses for loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the loan growth and deteriorating macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by sale of consumer installment loans to a third-party sponsored VIE. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information on the sale of consumer installment loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 66.4 million, or 45 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to 33.8 million, or 22 basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net charge-offs primarily related to 11.0 million of commercial and industrial loans originated under the PPP that were subsequently determined to be ineligible for SBA forgiveness and guarantee and ultimately deemed uncollectible, a partial charge-off of 7.9 million for a performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan that Customers decided to exit, higher charge-offs for consumer installment loans and overdrawn deposit accounts. 
 The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 also included a provision for credit losses of 0.6 million on certain asset-backed securities included in our investment securities available for sale. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information.

 Commercial lease income 
 Commercial lease income represents income earned on commercial operating leases generated by Customers' Equipment Finance Group in which Customers is the lessor. The 6.6 million increase in commercial lease income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from the continued growth of Customers' equipment finance business. 
 Bank-owned life insurance 
 Bank-owned life insurance income represents income earned on life insurance policies owned by Customers including an increase in cash surrender value of the policies and any benefits paid by insurance carriers under the policies. The 7.3 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from an increase in cash surrender value of the policies and benefits paid by insurance carriers under the policies. 
 Mortgage warehouse transactional fees 
 The 6.1 million decrease in mortgage warehouse transactional fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from a decrease in refinancing activity driven by rising interest rates. There can be no assurance that Customers will earn mortgage warehouse transactional fees in 2023 comparable to 2022, given lower mortgage activity in a rising interest rate environment that is expected to continue in 2023. 
 Gain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans 
 The 8.2 million decrease in gain on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from 3.2 million in gains realized from the sales of 31.8 million in SBA loans and a commercial lease in 2022, as compared to 6.1 million in gains from sales of 66.6 million in SBA loans and 5.2 million in gains from sales of 212.3 million in consumer installment loans in 2021. There can be no assurance that Customers will realize gains on the sale of loans in 2023, given the significant uncertainty in the capital markets that is expected to continue in 2023. 
 79 

Loss on sale of consumer installment loans 
 The 23.5 million increase in loss on sale of consumer installment loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects loss on sales of 521.8 million in consumer installment loans, inclusive of accrued interest and unamortized deferred loan origination costs, to a third-party sponsored VIE. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 Loan fees 
 The 4.7 million increase in loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in fees earned on unused lines of credit, servicing fees and other fees from commercial borrowers. 
 Net gain (loss) on sale of investment securities 
 The 54.6 million decrease in net gain on sale of investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the net losses realized from the sale of 983.6 million in AFS debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the gains realized from the sale of 689.9 million in AFS debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that Customers will realize gains on the sale of investment securities in 2023, given the significant uncertainty in the capital markets and fluctuations in our funding needs, which may impact Customers investment strategy. 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities 
 The 3.4 million decrease in unrealized gain on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects the unrealized loss on CRA-qualified mutual fund shares in 2022 and unrealized gain of equity securities issued by a foreign entity that were held by CB Green Ventures Pte Ltd. and CUBI India Ventures Pte Ltd. in 2021. Customers sold all outstanding shares in CB Green Ventures Pte Ltd. and CUBI India Ventures Pte Ltd. for 3.8 million in 2021. 
 Loss on sale of foreign subsidiaries 
 The 2.8 million decrease in loss on sale of foreign subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the realized loss from the sale of CB Green Ventures Pte Ltd. and CUBI India Ventures Pte Ltd., which held the equity securities issued by a foreign entity in 2021. Customers sold all outstanding shares in CB Green Ventures Pte Ltd. and CUBI India Ventures Pte Ltd. for 3.8 million in 2021. 
 Loss on cash flow hedge derivative terminations 
 The 24.5 million decrease in loss on cash flow hedge derivative terminations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the early terminations of derivatives designated in cash flow hedging relationships and reclassification of the realized losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings because the hedged forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring in 2021. 
 Legal settlement gain 
 The 7.5 million increase in legal settlement gain for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the gain from the court-approved settlement with a third party PPP service provider. 
 Other non-interest income 
 The 1.7 million decrease in other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from a decrease in SERP income due to changes in capital markets.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE 
 The table below presents the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Salaries and employee benefits 112,365 108,202 4,163 3.8 Technology, communication and bank operations 84,998 83,544 1,454 1.7 Professional services 27,465 26,688 777 2.9 Occupancy 13,606 12,143 1,463 12.0 Commercial lease depreciation 22,978 17,824 5,154 28.9 FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees 8,869 10,061 (1,192) (11.8) Loan servicing 15,023 10,763 4,260 39.6 Advertising and promotion 2,541 1,520 1,021 67.2 Merger and acquisition related expenses 418 (418) (100.0) Loan workout 1,072 265 807 304.5 Deposit relationship adjustment fees 6,216 (6,216) (100.0) Other 15,712 16,663 (951) (5.7) Total non-interest expense 304,629 294,307 10,322 3.5 
 Salaries and employee benefits 
 The 4.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in average full-time equivalent team members needed for future growth, annual merit increases, increase in stock-based compensation related to new awards and severance expenses. These increases were offset in part by decreases in compensation expense associated with an executive's retirement and other one-time benefits in 2021 and a decrease in incentive accruals tied to Customers' overall performance. 
 Technology, communication and bank operations 
 The 1.5 million increase in technology, communication and bank operations expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from increases of 4.4 million in software licenses and fees paid for software as a service, partially offset by decreases in deposit servicing fees from lower deposits and interchange maintenance fees from lower debit card spend, that were paid to BM Technologies, the successor entity to BMT that was divested on January 4, 2021. Customers incurred 57.0 million and 59.5 million in deposit servicing fees to BM Technologies under the deposit servicing agreement during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers held 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies, respectively. Customers currently expects that approximately half of these serviced deposits will leave Customers Bank by the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of such deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. The deposit service agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. Customers and BM Technologies also agreed to remove Customers' obligation under the deposit servicing agreement to pay BM Technologies the interchange maintenance fee which is the difference between the Durbin-exempt and Durbin-recalculated interchange revenues. The other terms of the deposit servicing agreement remain in effect through the new termination date. Customers and BM Technologies are currently negotiating an extension of this agreement with respect to the serviced deposits expected to remain at Customers Bank after June 30, 2023. For additional information, refer to "NOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Professional services 
 The 0.8 million increase in professional services for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in legal fees in connection with the legal settlement with a third party PPP service provider, partially offset by a decrease in outside professional services used to support the PPP forgiveness process and our participation in the latest round of PPP in 2021. 
 81 

Occupancy 
 The 1.5 million increase in occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to impairment charges of 1.4 million for ROU assets, bank premises and equipment related to consolidation of branch locations and other offices. 
 Commercial lease depreciation 
 The 5.2 million increase in commercial lease depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from the continued growth of the operating lease arrangements originated by Customers' Equipment Finance Group in which Customers is the lessor. 
 FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees 
 The 1.2 million decrease in FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from a decrease in FDIC assessment rates. In October 2022, FDIC issued a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate by two basis points for all insured depository institutions beginning in 2023. 
 Loan servicing 
 The 4.3 million increase in loan servicing for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from servicing fees paid to third party servicers associated with the growth in consumer installment loans, including those loans sold to a third-party sponsored VIE, and residential mortgages, partially offset by a decrease in servicing fees paid to third party servicers associated with the participation in the latest round of PPP in 2021 and the PPP forgiveness process. 
 Advertising and promotion 
 The 1.0 million increase in advertising and promotion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from higher spending on advertising agencies and media, primarily for our deposit products. 
 Merger and acquisition related expenses 
 The 0.4 million decrease in merger and acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from the merger of BankMobile Technologies, Inc. and Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. completed on January 4, 2021. 
 Loan workout 
 The 0.8 million increase in loan workout related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from legal fees incurred in connection with a performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan that Customers decided to exit and loans to a commercial mortgage warehouse borrower that filed for bankruptcy. 
 Deposit relationship adjustment fees 
 The 6.2 million decrease in deposit relationship adjustment fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from a make-whole fee paid to a single high-cost deposit customer to amend a long-term deposit contract as a part of Customers' initiative to lower its cost of funds in 2021. 
 Other non-interest expenses 
 The 1.0 million decrease in other non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from decreases in provision for operating losses of 1.0 million, loan origination expenses associated with the latest round of PPP of 0.9 million, corporate sponsorships of 0.9 million and litigation settlement of 1.2 million in 2021. These decreases were offset in part by increases of 1.9 million in expenses primarily associated with our team members' return to office and business development and 0.9 million in provision for credit losses on lending-related unfunded commitments. 
 82 

INCOME TAXES 
 The table below presents income tax expense from continuing operations and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 The 23.7 million decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from a decrease in pre-tax income from continuing operations. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from the recognition of uncertain tax positions in 2022, a decrease in tax credit benefits, recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the outside basis difference of foreign subsidiaries in 2021 and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in 2021, partially offset by increases in death benefits from bank-owned life insurance policies in 2022. For the reconciliation of the effective tax rate and the statutory federal tax rate, refer to "NOTE 16 INCOME TAXES" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 
 NET LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
 On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BMT, the technology arm of its BankMobile segment, to MFAC Merger Sub Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MFAC, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 6, 2020, by and among MFAC, MFAC Merger Sub Inc., BMT, Customers Bank, the sole stockholder of BMT, and Customers Bancorp, the parent bank holding company for Customers Bank (as amended on November 2, 2020 and December 8, 2020). In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc. Following the completion of the divestiture of BMT, BankMobile's serviced deposits and loans and the related net interest income have been combined with Customers' financial condition and the results of operations as a single reportable segment. 
 BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture are reflected in Customers Bancorp s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. BMT's operating results and associated cash flows have been presented as "Discontinued operations" within the accompanying audited financial statements and prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. 
 The table below presents the loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Change Loss from discontinued operations before income tax expense (benefit) (20,354) 20,354 (100.0) Income tax expense (benefit) from discontinued operations 19,267 (19,267) (100.0) Net loss from discontinued operations (39,621) 39,621 (100.0) 
 Customers had no loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to loss from discontinued operations of 20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of restricted stock awards in BM Technologies' common stock distributed to certain team members of BMT in the form of severance payments and compensation costs for the restricted stock units of Customers Bancorp previously granted to certain team members of BMT that vested upon completion of the divestiture on January 4, 2021. 
 Customers had no income tax expense from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an income tax expense of 19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted from the effect of the divestiture being treated as a taxable asset sale for tax purposes, offset in part by the reversal of a valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets which can be realized as a result of the gain from the divestiture and the tax benefits related to the restricted stock awards in BM Technologies' common stock and vesting of restricted stock units of Customers Bancorp to certain team members of BMT. 
 83 

In connection with the divestiture, Customers entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers incurred expenses of 57.0 million and 59.5 million to BM Technologies under the deposit servicing agreement included in technology, communication and bank operations within the income from continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers held 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies, respectively. Customers currently expects that approximately half of these serviced deposits will leave Customers Bank by the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of such deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023.

On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022.

The other terms of the deposit servicing agreement remain in effect through the new termination date. Customers and BM Technologies are currently negotiating an extension of this agreement with respect to the serviced deposits expected to remain at Customers Bank after June 30, 2023. The loan agreement with BM Technologies was terminated early in November 2021. The transition services agreement with BM Technologies, as amended, expired on March 31, 2022.

 Customers' total assets were 20.9 billion at December 31, 2022. This represented a 1.3 billion increase from total assets of 19.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by increases of 4.1 billion in loans and leases receivable, 840.3 million in investment securities held to maturity, 312.1 million in loans held for sale and a decrease in ACL of 6.9 million, partially offset by decreases of 961.0 million in loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value, 2.3 billion in loans receivable, PPP, 829.7 million in investment securities available for sale and 62.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Total liabilities were 19.5 billion at December 31, 2022. This represented a 1.3 billion increase from 18.2 billion at December 31, 2021.

The following table sets forth certain key condensed balance sheet data as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Change Cash and cash equivalents 455,806 518,032 (62,226) (12.0) Investment securities, at fair value 2,987,500 3,817,150 (829,650) (21.7) Investment securities held to maturity 840,259 840,259 NM Loans held for sale 328,312 16,254 312,058 NM Loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value 1,323,312 2,284,325 (961,013) (42.1) Loans receivable, PPP 998,153 3,250,008 (2,251,855) (69.3) Loans and leases receivable 13,144,894 9,018,298 4,126,596 45.8 Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases (130,924) (137,804) 6,880 (5.0) Bank-owned life insurance 338,441 333,705 4,736 1.4 Other assets 400,135 305,611 94,524 30.9 Total assets 20,896,112 19,575,028 1,321,084 6.7 Total deposits 18,156,953 16,777,924 1,379,029 8.2 Federal funds purchased 75,000 (75,000) (100.0) FHLB advances 800,000 700,000 100,000 14.3 Other borrowings 123,580 223,086 (99,506) (44.6) Subordinated debt 181,952 181,673 279 0.2 Accrued interest payable and other liabilities 230,666 251,128 (20,462) (8.1) Total liabilities 19,493,151 18,208,811 1,284,340 7.1 Total shareholders equity 1,402,961 1,366,217 36,744 2.7 Total liabilities and shareholders equity 20,896,112 19,575,028 1,321,084 6.7 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits. Cash and due from banks consists mainly of vault cash and cash items in the process of collection. Cash and due from banks were 58.0 million and 35.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash and cash due from banks balances vary from day to day, primarily due to variations in customers deposit activities with the Bank. 
 Interest-earning deposits consist of cash deposited at other banks, primarily the FRB. Interest-earning deposits were 397.8 million and 482.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The balance of interest-earning deposits varies from day to day, depending on several factors, such as fluctuations in customers deposits with Customers, payment of checks drawn on customers accounts and strategic investment decisions made to maximize Customers' net interest income, while effectively managing interest-rate risk and liquidity. The decrease in interest-earning deposits since December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from managing liquidity as excess funds from the forgiveness of PPP loans and recent deposits were deployed into higher interest-earning assets. 
 Investment securities, at fair value 
 The investment securities portfolio is an important source of interest income and liquidity. It consists primarily of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by agencies of the United States government, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate notes and certain equity securities. In addition to generating revenue, the investment portfolio is maintained to manage interest-rate risk, provide liquidity, serve as collateral for other borrowings, and diversify the credit risk of interest-earning assets. The portfolio is structured to optimize net interest income given the changes in the economic environment, liquidity position and balance sheet mix. 
 85 

At December 31, 2022, investment securities at fair value totaled 3.0 billion compared to 3.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease primarily resulted from the sale of 983.6 million of asset-backed securities, agency-guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, private label collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate notes, the transfer of certain agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and private label collateralized mortgage obligations totaling 500.2 million to investment securities held to maturity, maturities, calls and principal repayments totaling 464.1 million and a decline in the fair value of AFS debt securities, or unrealized losses of 236.8 million due to changes in market interest rates, partially offset by the purchases of asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, agency-guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate notes totaling 1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 For financial reporting purposes, AFS debt securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt securities, other than credit losses, are included in other comprehensive income (loss) and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity, net of the related tax effect. Changes in the fair value of equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and securities reported at fair value based on a fair value option election are recorded in non-interest income in the period in which they occur. Customers recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.6 million on certain asset-backed securities included in our investment securities at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 The following table sets forth information about the maturities and weighted-average yield of the AFS debt securities portfolio. The weighted-average yield is computed based on a constant effective interest rate over the contractual life of each security adjusted for prepayment estimates, and considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Yields are not reported on a tax-equivalent basis. Yields exclude the impact of related hedging derivatives.

 Investment securities held to maturity 
 In June 2022, Customers transferred 500.2 million in net carrying value of certain debt securities from available for sale to held to maturity as part of Customers' ongoing asset liability management primarily to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on the long duration component of the investment portfolio. At the time of transfer to held to maturity, these debt securities had unrealized losses of 50.0 million which, along with the unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income, will be amortized over the remaining terms of the securities as an adjustment to yield (interest income) using the effective interest method, resulting in no impact to earnings. 
 On September 30, 2022, Customers sold 521.8 million of consumer installment loans inclusive of accrued interest and unamortized deferred loan origination costs, to a third-party sponsored VIE. As part of these sales, Customers recognized a loss on sale of 23.5 million in loss on sale of consumer installment loans within non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 (2) Includes deferred (fees) costs and unamortized (discounts) premiums, net of (21.5) million and (52.0) million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value 
 The mortgage warehouse product line primarily provides financing to mortgage companies nationwide from the time of origination of the underlying mortgage loans until the mortgage loans are sold into the secondary market. As a mortgage warehouse lender, Customers provides a form of financing to mortgage bankers by purchasing for resale the underlying residential mortgages on a short-term basis under a master repurchase agreement. These loans are reported as loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Because these loans are reported at their fair value, they do not have an ACL and are therefore excluded from ACL-related disclosures. At December 31, 2022, all of Customers' commercial mortgage warehouse loans were current in terms of payment. 
 Customers is subject to the risks associated with such lending, including, but not limited to, the risks of fraud, bankruptcy and default of the mortgage banker or of the underlying residential borrower, any of which could result in credit losses. Customers' mortgage warehouse lending team members monitor these mortgage originators by obtaining financial and other relevant information to reduce these risks during the lending period. Loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value totaled 1.3 billion and 2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 90 

On June 30, 2022, one of Customers commercial mortgage warehouse borrowers filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. As of December 31, 2022, Customers had an outstanding loan balance with the borrower of 6.0 million in an unsecured working capital loan that was fully guaranteed by an affiliate of the primary shareholder of the borrower. Customers' loan to the borrower subject to a master repurchase agreement secured by first lien residential mortgages was fully repaid during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Loans receivable, PPP 
 Customers had 1.0 billion and 3.3 billion of PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, provided that the SBA's eligibility criteria are met and earn a fixed interest rate of 1.00 . Customers recognized interest income, including origination fees, of 79.4 million and 279.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. PPP loans include an embedded credit enhancement from the SBA, which guarantees 100 of the principal and interest owed by the borrower provided that the SBA's eligibility criteria are met. As a result, the eligible PPP loans do not have an ACL and are therefore excluded from ACL-related disclosures. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, 11.0 million of commercial and industrial loans originated under the PPP were subsequently determined to be ineligible for SBA forgiveness and guarantee. These loans were ultimately deemed uncollectible and charged off during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Loans and leases receivable 
 Loans and leases receivable (excluding loans held for sale, loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value, and loans receivable, PPP), net of the ACL, increased by 4.1 billion to 13.0 billion at December 31, 2022, from 8.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in loans and leases receivable, net of the ACL, was attributable to 6.9 million decrease in ACL, as further described below, and higher balances in the specialty lending and other commercial and industrial, multifamily, owner occupied commercial real estate, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios, with each portfolio increasing by 3.0 billion, 239.2 million, 726.7 million, 230.4 million, 169.5 million and 163.2 million, respectively, from December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the consumer installment portfolio of 366.5 million from December 31, 2021. The overall loans and leases receivable fluctuations were the result of Customers' strategic efforts to redeploy the funds from PPP loan forgiveness into commercial and industrial loans and leases, including secured and variable rate loans within specialty lending, multifamily loans and residential mortgages. Customers reduced its installment loan portfolio through the sale of 521.8 million in consumer installment loans, inclusive of accrued interest and unamortized deferred loan origination costs, to a third-party sponsored VIE. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information on the sale of the consumer installment loans. 
 The following table presents Customers' loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale, loans receivable, at fair value, and loans receivable, PPP) as of December 31, 2022 based on the remaining term to contractual maturity: (amounts in thousands) Within one year After one but within five years After five but within fifteen years After fifteen years Total Commercial loans: Commercial and industrial, including specialty lending 1,118,577 4,214,219 1,267,039 72,995 6,672,830 Multifamily 69,356 325,444 1,818,219 2,213,019 Commercial real estate owner occupied 149,875 402,708 237,861 94,895 885,339 Commercial real estate non-owner occupied 173,947 801,940 314,843 1,290,730 Construction 12,516 81,001 68,492 162,009 Total commercial loans 1,524,271 5,825,312 3,706,454 167,890 11,223,927 Consumer loans: Residential real estate 7,835 1,120 8,663 480,334 497,952 Manufactured housing 144 3,750 31,235 9,947 45,076 Installment 18,982 986,668 283,827 88,462 1,377,939 Total consumer loans 26,961 991,538 323,725 578,743 1,920,967

 Credit Risk 
 Customers manages credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan and lease portfolio, establishing and enforcing prudent underwriting standards and collection efforts, and continuous and periodic loan and lease classification reviews. Management also considers the effect of credit risk on financial performance by reviewing quarterly and maintaining an adequate ACL. Credit losses are charged-off when they are identified, and provisions are added for current expected credit losses, to the ACL at least quarterly. The ACL is estimated at least quarterly. 
 The provision for credit losses on loans and leases was 59.5 million and 27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The ACL maintained for loans and leases receivable (excluding loans held for sale and loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value) was 130.9 million, or 0.93 of loans and leases receivable and 1.00 of loans and leases receivable, excluding PPP loans (a non-GAAP measure), at December 31, 2022, and 137.8 million, or 1.12 of loans and leases receivable and 1.53 of loans and leases receivable, excluding PPP loans (a non-GAAP measure), at December 31, 2021. Excluding loans receivable, PPP from total loans and leases receivable is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule below. 
 The decrease in the ACL resulted primarily from lower ACL for the consumer installment loan portfolio from the sale of 521.8 million, inclusive of accrued interest and unamortized deferred loan origination costs, to a third-party sponsored VIE, offset in part by the increase in ACL due to loan growth and deteriorating macroeconomic forecasts. Refer to "NOTE 6 INVESTMENT SECURITIES" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information on the sale of consumer installment loans. Net charge-offs were 66.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 32.6 million compared to 33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to 11.0 million in commercial and industrial loans originated under the PPP that were subsequently determined to be ineligible for SBA forgiveness and guarantee and ultimately deemed uncollectible, a partial charge-off of 7.9 million for a performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan that Customers decided to exit, and higher charge-offs for consumer installment loans and overdrawn deposit accounts. Installment charge-offs were attributable to unsecured consumer loans originated and purchased through arrangements with fintech companies and other market place lenders, which increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 consistent with the loan growth. Refer to the table of changes in Customers' ACL for net-charge offs to average loans by loan type for the periods indicated.

The ACL is based on a quarterly evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio and is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses as of the balance sheet date. All commercial loans, with the exception of PPP loans and commercial mortgage warehouse loans, which are reported at fair value, are assigned internal credit-risk ratings, based upon an assessment of the borrower, the structure of the transaction and the available collateral and/or guarantees. All loans and leases are monitored regularly by the responsible officer, and the risk ratings are adjusted when considered appropriate. The risk assessment allows management to identify problem loans and leases timely. Management considers a variety of factors and recognizes the inherent risk of loss that always exists in the lending process. Management uses a disciplined methodology to estimate an appropriate level of ACL. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates herein and "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" to Customers' audited financial statements for Customers' adoption of CECL and management's methodology for estimating the ACL. 
 Approximately 43 of Customers commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, consumer residential and commercial and industrial loan types have real estate as collateral (collectively, the real estate portfolio ), primarily in the form of a first lien position. Current appraisals providing current value estimates of the property are received when Customers' credit group determines that the facts and circumstances have significantly changed since the date of the last appraisal, including that real estate values have deteriorated. The credit committee and loan officers review loans that are 15 or more days delinquent and all non-accrual loans on a periodic basis. In addition, loans where the loan officers have identified a borrower of interest are discussed to determine if additional analysis is necessary to apply the risk-rating criteria properly. The risk ratings for the real estate loan portfolio are determined based upon the current information available, including but not limited to discussions with the borrower, updated financial information, economic conditions within the geographic area and other factors that may affect the cash flow of the loan. If a loan is individually evaluated for impairment, the collateral value or discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to determine the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated selling costs, and compared to the outstanding loan balance to determine the amount of reserve necessary, if any. Appraisals used in this evaluation process are typically less than two years aged. For loans where real estate is not the primary source of collateral, updated financial information is obtained, including accounts receivable and inventory aging reports and relevant supplemental financial data to estimate the fair value of the loan, net of estimated selling costs, and compared to the outstanding loan balance to estimate the required reserve. 
 These impairment measurements are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, including, among others, estimates of property values in appraisals, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on individual loans, and general considerations for historical loss experience, economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios, all of which require judgment and may be susceptible to significant change over time and as a result of changing economic conditions or other factors. Pursuant to ASC 326, individually assessed loans, consisting primarily of non-accrual and restructured loans, are considered in the methodology for determining the ACL. Individually assessed loans are generally evaluated based on the expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral if principal repayment is expected to substantially come from the operation of the collateral or fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided from the sale of such collateral. Shortfalls in the underlying collateral value for loans or leases determined to be collateral dependent are charged off immediately. Subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate, management will assess whether there was a further decline in the value of the collateral based on changes in market conditions or property use that would require additional impairment to be recorded to reflect the particular situation, thereby increasing the ACL on loans and leases.

 Asset quality assurance activities include careful monitoring of borrower payment status and the periodic review of borrower current financial information to ensure ongoing financial strength and borrower cash flow viability. Customers has established credit policies and procedures, seeks the consistent application of those policies and procedures across the organization and adjusts policies as appropriate for changes in market conditions and applicable regulations. 
 Problem Loan Identification and Management 
 To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial and industrial, multifamily, commercial real estate and construction portfolios and for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the ACL for individually assessed loans, Customers utilizes the following categories of risk ratings: pass (there are six risk ratings for pass loans), special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The risk-rating categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated regularly thereafter. Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers who do not have identified potential or well-defined weaknesses and for whom there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated periodically based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on a quarterly basis, generally during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter. While assigning risk ratings involves judgment, the risk-rating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and allocate the appropriate resources to manage the loans and leases. PPP loans are excluded, provided that the SBA's eligibility criteria are met, as these loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 
 Customers assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If not addressed, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan and lease and Customers' financial position. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, special mention loans and leases were 138.8 million and 230.1 million, respectively, and are considered performing loans and are therefore not included in the tables above. 
 Risk ratings are not established for residential real estate, home equity loans and installment loans mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of homogeneous loans with smaller balances. Instead, these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends. 
 A regular reporting and review process is in place to provide for proper portfolio oversight and control and to monitor those loans and leases identified as problem credits by management. This process is designed to assess Customers' progress in working toward a solution and to assist in determining an appropriate ACL. All loan work-out situations involve the active participation of management and are reported regularly to the Board of Directors. When a loan or lease becomes delinquent for 90 days or more, or earlier if considered appropriate, the loan is assigned to SAG for workout or other resolution. 
 Loan and lease charge-offs are determined on a case-by-case basis. Loans and leases are generally charged-off when principal is likely to be unrecoverable and after appropriate collection steps have been taken. Loan and lease charge-offs are proposed by the SAG and approved by the Board of Directors. 
 Loan and lease policies and procedures are reviewed internally for possible revisions and changes on a regular basis. In addition, these policies and procedures, together with the loan and lease portfolio, are reviewed on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies and by our internal, external and loan review auditors, as part of their examination and audit procedures.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were 16.8 million, 16.5 million and 16.1 million, respectively, in loans categorized as a TDR. TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the period of their restructuring and are evaluated to determine whether they should be placed on non-accrual status. In subsequent years, a TDR may be returned to accrual status if the borrower satisfies a minimum six-month performance requirement; however, it will remain classified as impaired. Generally, Customers requires sustained performance for nine months before returning a TDR to accrual status. 
 Modification of PCD loans that are accounted for within loan pools in accordance with the accounting standards for PCD loans does not result in the removal of these loans from the pool even if the modification would otherwise be considered a TDR. Accordingly, as each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an expectation of cash flows, modifications of loans within such pools are not reported as TDRs. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Customers implemented a short-term loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of its borrowers who met the program's qualifications in 2020. This program allowed for a deferral of payments for a maximum of 90 days at a time. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. On December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, which extended and expanded various relief provisions of the CARES Act including the temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs until January 1, 2022. All commercial loans previously on deferments became current by December 31, 2021. Total consumer deferments were 6.1 million at December 31, 2021. There were no commercial or consumer loans on deferments related to COVID-19 at December 31, 2022. 
 TDR modifications primarily involve interest-rate concessions, extensions of term, deferrals of principal and other modifications. Other modifications typically reflect other nonstandard terms which Customers would not offer in non-troubled situations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, loans aggregating 3.3 million, 3.5 million and 3.7 million, respectively, were modified in TDRs. TDR modifications of residential real estate loans were primarily extensions of term, interest rate concessions and other modifications; modifications of manufactured housing loans were primarily interest rate concessions; and modifications of consumer installment loans were primarily other modifications. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified in TDRs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 212 installment loans totaling 2.2 million, 15 manufactured housing loans totaling 491 thousand and two residential real estate loans for 201 thousand that were modified in TDRs within the past twelve months defaulted on payments. As of December 31, 2021, 21 installment loans totaling 263 thousand, two manufactured housing loans totaling 71 thousand and one residential real estate loan for 121 thousand that were modified in TDRs within the past twelve months defaulted on payments. As of December 31, 2020, 15 installment loans totaling 226 thousand, six manufactured housing loans totaling 236 thousand and three residential real estate loans totaling 152 thousand that were modified in TDRs within the past twelve months defaulted on payments. 
 Loans modified in TDRs are evaluated for impairment. The nature and extent of impairment of TDRs, including those that have experienced a subsequent default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of ACL. 
 
 ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE 
 At December 31, 2022, accrued interest receivable totaled 123.4 million compared to 92.2 million at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in outstanding balances of variable rate interest-earning assets and rising interest rates. 
 BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS 
 At December 31, 2022, bank premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, totaled 9.0 million compared to 8.9 million at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily resulted from purchases of IT equipment, partially offset by impairment of leasehold improvements and equipment related to consolidation of branch locations and other offices and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 
 At December 31, 2022, Customers Bank s restricted stock holdings totaled 74.2 million compared to 64.6 million at December 31, 2021. These holdings consist of stock of the FRB, the FHLB and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and are required as part of our relationship with these banks. 
 At December 31, 2022, the cash surrender value of BOLI totaled 338.4 million compared to 333.7 million at December 31, 2021. Presented within BOLI on the consolidated balance sheets is the cash surrender value of the SERP balances of 12.3 million and 11.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers entered into additional SERPs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For additional information, see "NOTE 14 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 99 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, other assets totaled 400.1 million and 305.6 million, respectively. Other assets consist primarily of operating leases through Customers' Equipment Finance Group (net investment in operating leases of 197.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 118.3 million at December 31, 2021), deferred tax assets, net, mark-to-market adjustments for interest-rate swaps, investments in affordable housing projects and other limited partnerships or limited liability companies, ROU assets and prepaid expenses. 
 
 DEPOSITS 
 Customers offers a variety of deposit accounts, including checking, savings, MMDA and time deposits. Deposits are primarily obtained from Customers' geographic service area and nationwide through branchless digital banking, our white label relationship, deposit brokers, listing services and other relationships. Customers accepts deposits from customers on the TassatPay instant blockchain payments platform which launched in October 2021. Customers Bank provides blockchain-based digital payments via CBIT, which allows clients to make instant payments in U.S. dollars. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the instant B2B payments platform by maintaining U.S. dollars in deposit accounts at Customers Bank. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank held 2.3 billion and 1.9 billion of deposits from customers participating in CBIT, respectively, which are reported as deposit liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Each CBIT is minted with precisely one U.S. dollar equivalent, and those dollars are held in a non-interest bearing omnibus deposit account until the CBIT is burned or redeemed. The number of CBIT outstanding in the CBIT instant payments platform is always equal to the U.S. dollars held in the omnibus deposit account at Customers Bank and is reported as a deposit liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The omnibus deposit account established for the CBIT instant payments platform had an outstanding balance of 23 thousand at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. For additional information, refer to "NOTE 11 - DEPOSITS" to Customers' audited financial statements.

Time deposits increased by 3.7 billion, or 737.7 , to 4.2 billion and interest bearing demand deposits increased by 2.0 billion, or 30.6 , to 8.5 billion. These increases were offset in part by decreases in non-interest bearing demand deposits of 2.6 billion, or 57.7 , to 1.9 billion and savings, including MMDA, of 1.8 billion, or 33.4 , to 3.5 billion. 
 Total deposits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 include 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively, of deposits serviced by BM Technologies under a deposit servicing agreement. The deposit servicing agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. Customers and BM Technologies also agreed to remove Customers' obligation under the deposit servicing agreement to pay BM Technologies the interchange maintenance fee which is the difference between the Durbin-exempt and Durbin-recalculated interchange revenues. The other terms of the deposit servicing agreement remain in effect through the new termination date. Refer to "NOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 At December 31, 2022 the Bank had 176.2 million in state and municipal deposits to which it had pledged 175.6 million of available borrowing capacity through the FHLB to the depositors through a letter of credit arrangement.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY 
 The components of shareholders equity were as follows at the dates indicated: December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Change Preferred stock 137,794 137,794 Common stock 35,012 34,722 290 0.8 Additional paid in capital 551,721 542,391 9,330 1.7 Retained earnings 924,134 705,732 218,402 30.9 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net (163,096) (4,980) (158,116) NM Treasury stock (82,604) (49,442) (33,162) 67.1 Total shareholders' equity 1,402,961 1,366,217 36,744 2.7 
 Shareholders' equity increased by 36.7 million, or 2.7 , to 1.4 billion at December 31, 2022, when compared to shareholders' equity of 1.4 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily resulted from increases in retained earnings of 218.4 million, common stock of 0.3 million and additional paid in capital of 9.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of 158.1 million and an increase in treasury stock of 33.2 million. 
 The increases in common stock and additional paid in capital primarily resulted from the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The increase in retained earnings primarily resulted from net income of 228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by preferred stock dividends of 9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net primarily resulted from an increase of 236.8 million in unrealized losses on AFS debt securities due to rising interest rates and income tax effect of 61.6 million, partially offset by reclassification of 23.2 million in net losses and income tax effect of 6.0 million resulting from the sales of AFS debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The increase treasury stock resulted from repurchase of 830,145 shares of common stock for 33.2 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program during the year ended December 31, 2022. On August 25, 2021, the Board of Directors of Customers Bancorp authorized the Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to 3,235,326 shares of the Company's common stock (representing 10 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock on June 30, 2021). The term of the Share Repurchase Program was extended for one additional year to September 27, 2023, unless earlier terminated. Purchases of shares under the Share Repurchase Program may be executed through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans, or otherwise. The exact number of shares, timing for such purchases, and the price and terms at and on which such purchases are to be made will be at the discretion of the Company and will comply with all applicable regulatory limitations. Refer to "NOTE 13 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information on the repurchase of common shares. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity for a financial institution is a measure of that institution s ability to meet depositors needs for funds, to satisfy or fund loan commitments and for other operating purposes. Ensuring adequate liquidity is an objective of the asset/liability management process. Customers coordinates its management of liquidity with its interest-rate sensitivity and capital position, and strives to maintain a strong liquidity position that is sufficient to meet Customers' short-term and long-term needs, commitments and contractual obligations. 
 Customers is involved with financial instruments and other commitments with off-balance sheet risks. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks are incurred in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of the Bank's customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, including unused portions of lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 With commitments to extend credit, exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and conditional obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Because they involve credit risk similar to extending a loan and lease, these financial instruments are subject to the Bank s credit policy and other underwriting standards. Refer to "NOTE 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 103 

As described in "NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" to Customers' audited financial statements, ACL on lending related commitments is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which Customers is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No ACL is recognized if Customers have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit commitments primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit disclosed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. Customers estimates the expected credit losses for undrawn or unfunded commitments using a usage given default calculation. The lifetime loss rates for off-balance sheet credit exposures are calculated in the same manner as on-balance sheet credit exposures, using the same models and economic forecasts, adjusted for the estimated likelihood that funding will occur. Customers recognized a provision for credit losses of 0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting in an ACL of 3.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Customers recognized a benefit to credit losses of 0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulting in an ACL of 2.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The ACL on lending-related commitments is recorded in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the credit loss expense is recorded as a provision for credit losses within other non-interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. 
 Customers' contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows include operating leases, demand deposits, time deposits, federal funds purchased, short-term and long-term advances from FHLB, unsecured senior notes, subordinated debt, loan and other commitments as of December 31, 2022. These obligations and commitments include the transfer of deposits serviced by BM Technologies under the deposit service agreement, described further below under cash flows from discontinued operations. Customers repaid 100.0 million of the 3.950 senior notes that matured in June 2022. Refer to "NOTE 9 LEASES", "NOTE 11 DEPOSITS", "NOTE 12 BORROWINGS" and "NOTE 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional information. 
 Customers' investment portfolio, including debt securities available for sale and held to maturity provides periodic cash flows through regular maturities and amortization and can be used as collateral to secure additional funding. Customers' principal sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans and leases, other funds from operations, and proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances. Borrowing arrangements are maintained with the FHLB and the FRB to meet short-term liquidity needs. Longer-term borrowing arrangements are also maintained with the FHLB and FRB. As of December 31, 2022, Customers' borrowing capacity with the FHLB was 3.2 billion, of which 800.0 million was utilized in borrowings and 175.6 million of available capacity was utilized to collateralize state and municipal deposits. As of December 31, 2021, Customers' borrowing capacity with the FHLB was 3.0 billion, of which 700.0 million was utilized in borrowings and 475.3 million of available capacity was used to collateralize state and municipal deposits. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers' borrowing capacity with the FRB was 2.5 billion and 183.1 million, respectively. 
 Beginning in second quarter 2020, Customers began participating in the PPPLF, in which Federal Reserve Banks extend non-recourse loans to institutions that are eligible to make PPP loans. Only PPP loans that are guaranteed by the SBA under the PPP, with respect to both principal and interest that are originated or purchased by an eligible institution, may be pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve Banks. As of December 31, 2022, Customers had 1.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding, which are eligible for forgiveness by the federal government. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Customers repaid the PPPLF advances. No new advances are available from the PPPLF after July 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had no borrowings under the PPPLF. 
 Customers Bank provides blockchain-based digital payments via CBIT, which allows clients to make instant payments in U.S. dollars. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the instant B2B payments platform by maintaining U.S. dollars in deposit accounts at Customers Bank. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers Bank held 2.3 billion and 1.9 billion of deposits from customers participating in CBIT, respectively, which are reported as deposit liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Each CBIT is minted with precisely one U.S. Dollar equivalent, and those dollars are held in a non-interest bearing omnibus deposit account until the CBIT is burned or redeemed. The number of CBIT outstanding in the CBIT instant payments platform is always equal to the U.S. dollars held in the omnibus deposit account at Customers Bank and is reported as a deposit liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The omnibus deposit account had an outstanding balance of 23 thousand at December 31, 2022 and no outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. 
 The principal source of the Bancorp's liquidity is the dividends it receives from the Bank, which may be impacted by the following: bank-level capital needs, laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions and other factors. The Bank has generated sufficient positive cash flows from operations to pay dividends to the Bancorp. However, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the Bancorp or its non-bank subsidiaries.

Cash flows from discontinued operations 
 Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BMT on January 4, 2021. BMT's operating results and associated cash flows have been presented as "Discontinued operations" within the consolidated financial statements and prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. In connection with the divestiture, Customers entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers held 1.1 billion and 1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies, respectively. Customers currently expects that approximately half of these serviced deposits will leave Customers Bank by the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of such deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023. The deposit servicing agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. On June 30, 2022, Customers provided a written notice to BM Technologies to terminate the deposit servicing agreement effective December 31, 2022. On November 7, 2022, Customers agreed to extend the deposit servicing agreement to the earlier of BM Technologies' successful completion of the transfer of the serviced deposits to a new sponsor bank or June 30, 2023.

 CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
 The Bank and the Bancorp are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Customers' financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank and the Bancorp must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. 
 In first quarter 2020, the U.S federal banking regulatory agencies permitted banking organizations to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 31, 2020, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows banking organizations to delay for two years 100 of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25 of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. Customers has elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the regulatory capital data presented below. The cumulative CECL capital transition impact as of December 31, 2021 which amounted to 61.6 million will be phased in at 25 per year beginning on January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, our regulatory capital ratios reflected 75 , or 46.2 million, benefit associated with the CECL transition provisions. 
 106 

In April 2020, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that permits banks to exclude the impact of participating in the SBA PPP program in their regulatory capital ratios. Specifically, PPP loans are zero percent risk weighted and a bank can exclude all PPP loans pledged as collateral to the PPPLF from its average total consolidated assets for purposes of calculating the Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio (i.e. leverage ratio). Customers applied this regulatory guidance in the calculation of its regulatory capital ratios presented below. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank and the Bancorp to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined in the regulations). At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank and the Bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. 
 Generally, to comply with the regulatory definition of adequately capitalized, or well capitalized, respectively, or to comply with the Basel III capital requirements, an institution must at least maintain the common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios and the Tier 1 leverage ratio in excess of the related minimum ratios set forth in the following table.

 The Basel III Capital Rules require that we maintain a 2.500 capital conservation buffer with respect to each of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank and the Bancorp were in compliance with the Basel III requirements. Refer to "NOTE 19 REGULATORY CAPITAL" to Customers' audited financial statements for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements.

Capital Ratios 
 Customers continued to build capital during 2022 and 2021. In 2019, Customers decided to cross the 10.0 billion asset threshold at year-end, with total assets of 11.5 billion at December 31, 2019, resulted in lower capital ratios when compared to December 31, 2018. In general, for the past few years, Customers Bancorp capital growth has been achieved by retained earnings and issuances of common stock under share-based compensation arrangements, offset in part by the repurchase of common shares. In 2021, Customers repurchased 527,789 shares of common stock for 27.7 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. In 2022, Customers repurchased 830,145 shares of its common stock for 33.2 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. The Share Repurchase Program was extended for one additional year to September 27, 2023, unless earlier terminated. During 2022 and 2021, Customers Bancorp did not issue any preferred stock or common stock other than in connection with share-based compensation agreements. In 2021, Customers Bancorp issued 100 million in fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, and utilized the proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock. Customers Bank capital growth for the past few years has been achieved primarily by retained earnings and capital contributions from Customers Bancorp from proceeds received from issuances of senior and subordinated notes. For more information relating to preferred and common stock, refer to "NOTE 13 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY" to Customers' audited financial statements. 
 Customers is unaware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on its liquidity, capital resources, or operations. 
 The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is an important objective of Customers' asset and liability management process. Through its initial capitalization and subsequent offerings, Customers believes it has continued to maintain a strong capital position. Since first quarter 2015, Customers Bank's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend to the Bank's sole shareholder, Customers Bancorp. Cash dividends declared by the Bank and paid to Customers Bancorp during 2022 and 2021, include the following: 
 30.0 million declared on June 23, 2021, and paid on June 24, 2021; 
 55.0 million declared on September 22, 2021, and paid on September 23, 2021; 
 55.0 million declared and paid on December 21, 2021; 
 20.0 million declared on March 23, 2022, and paid on March 24, 2022; 
 5.0 million declared on June 22, 2022, and paid on June 23, 2022; 
 25.0 million declared on September 28, 2022, and paid on September 29, 2022; and 
 2.0 million declared on December 20, 2022, and paid on December 22, 2022. 
 
 Effect of Government Monetary Policies 
 Our earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and interest rates. Among the instruments used to implement those objectives are open market operations in United States government securities and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans and leases, investments, and deposits, and their use may also affect rates charged on loans and leases or paid for deposits. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 The largest component of Customers' net income is net interest income, and the majority of its financial instruments are interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various term structures and maturities. One of the primary objectives of management is to optimize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities, loan prepayments, deposit withdrawals and differences in lending and funding rates. Customers' asset/liability committee actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 Customers uses two complementary methods to analyze and measure interest rate sensitivity as part of the overall management of interest rate risk; they are income scenario modeling and estimates of EVE. The combination of these two methods provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the levels of interest rate risk of Customers' exposure to time factors and changes in interest rate environments. 
 108 

Income scenario modeling is used to measure interest rate sensitivity and manage interest rate risk. Income scenario considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates upon forecasted net interest income but also other factors such as yield curve relationships, the volume and mix of assets and liabilities, customer preferences and general market conditions. 
 Through the use of income scenario modeling, Customers has estimated the net interest income for the year ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, based upon the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments in existence at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Customers has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon interest rates rising or falling immediately ("rate shocks"). For upward rate shocks modeling a rising rate environment at December 31, 2022, current market interest rates were increased immediately by 100, 200 and 300 basis points. For downward rate shocks modeling a falling rate environment, current market rates at December 31, 2022 were decreased immediately by 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the year ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, resulting from changes in interest rates. 
 Net change in net interest income Change December 31, Rate Shocks 2022 2021 Up 3 0.4 16.0 Up 2 0.4 10.8 Up 1 0.3 5.7 Down 1 (0.9) N/A Down 2 (2.0) N/A Down 3 (4.8) N/A 
 EVE estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows. Discount rates are based upon market prices for comparable assets and liabilities. Upward and downward rate shocks are used to measure volatility of EVE in relation to a constant rate environment. For upward rate shocks modeling a rising rate environment at December 31, 2022, current market interest rates were increased immediately by 100, 200 and 300 basis points. For downward rate shocks modeling a falling rate environment, current market rates at December 31, 2022 were decreased immediately by 100, 200 and 300 basis points. This method of measurement primarily evaluates the longer-term repricing risks and options in Customers Bank s balance sheet. The following table reflects the estimated EVE at risk and the ratio of EVE to EVE adjusted assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, resulting from shocks to interest rates. From Base December 31, Rate Shocks 2022 2021 Up 3 (27.8) 100.7 Up 2 (16.9) 79.8 Up 1 (6.6) 51.5 Down 1 0.0 N/A Down 2 (31.3) N/A Down 3 (57.2) N/A Management believes that the assumptions and combination of methods utilized in evaluating estimated net interest income are reasonable. However, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income, could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the model. 
 
 LIBOR Transition 
 Customers has variable rate loans, investment securities, fixed-to-floating rate senior and subordinated debt, preferred stocks and derivatives that reference LIBOR. Various regulatory bodies have encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable, generally cease entering new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate no later than December 31, 2021, and for new contracts to utilize a reference rate other than LIBOR or include robust language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR s discontinuation. Certain tenors of LIBOR have ceased publication and complete cessation of LIBOR publication is expected by June 30, 2023. Effective December 31, 2021, Customers has essentially discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts. Customers established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program, which includes a LIBOR transition team with senior management level leadership. Progress on the LIBOR transition effort is monitored by executive management as well as the asset/liability committee of Customers' Board of Directors. 
 109 

At December 31, 2022, Customers had LIBOR-based commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages of 2.1 billion, which either mature before June 30, 2023 or have been amended to include appropriate alternative language to be effective upon cessation of LIBOR publication. In addition, 110.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate borrowings and 137.8 million of preferred equity instruments reference LIBOR. Customers' derivatives primarily reference LIBOR. In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement IBOR Supplement and the IBOR Fallback Protocol IBOR Protocol ). The IBOR Protocol enables market participants to incorporate certain revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives with other counterparties that also choose to adhere to the IBOR Protocol. Customers adhered to the IBOR Protocol in November 2020 and is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap transactions with its end-user customers. With respect to Customers' cleared interest rate swap agreements that reference LIBOR, clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant SOFR benchmark alternatives of the IBOR Supplement and the IBOR Protocol. As loans mature and new originations occur a larger percentage of Customers' variable-rate loans are expected to reference SOFR. At December 31, 2022, Customers had approximately 4.0 billion of outstanding loan balances that reference SOFR. Customers usage of interest rate swap agreements referenced to SOFR is expected to increase in response to the discontinuation of LIBOR. Customers continues to work with its customers and other counterparties to remediate LIBOR-based agreements which expire after June 30, 2023 by incorporating alternative language, negotiating new agreements, or other means. The discontinuation of LIBOR and uncertainty relating to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indexes to replace LIBOR could materially impact Customers interest rate risk profile and its management thereof. For a discussion of the risks associated with the LIBOR transition to alternative reference rates, refer to Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors".

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Customers Bancorp, Inc. 
 West Reading, Pennsylvania 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Customers Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Management s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company s loan and lease portfolios are recorded in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases (the ACL ). The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans or leases' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans and leases. The ACL on collectively assessed loans and leases is measured over the expected life of the loan or lease using lifetime loss rate models which consider historical loan performance, loan or borrower attributes and forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. It is deducted from the loans or leases amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans and leases. 
 
 112 

The ACL on collectively assessed loans and leases is measured over the expected life of the loan or lease using lifetime loss rate models which consider historical loan performance, loan or borrower attributes, and forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. For certain loan portfolios with limited historical loss experience, Customers calibrates the modelled lifetime loss rates to peer or industry information. Significant loan/borrower attributes utilized in the models include origination date, maturity date, collateral property type, internal risk rating, delinquency status, borrower state and FICO score at origination. Customers uses external sources in the creation of its forecasts, including current economic conditions and forecasts for macroeconomic variables over its reasonable and supportable forecast period (e.g., GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, BBB spread, commercial real estate and home price indices). After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which ranges from two to five years, the models revert the forecasted macroeconomic variables to their historical long-term trends, without specific predictions for the economy, over the expected life of the pool. The Company estimates its ACL on a quarterly basis and qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within the models, but which are relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan and lease pools. 
 
 The estimation of the ACL requires management to make significant judgments in regard to (a) selecting reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, (b) using models to estimate expected losses for each material loan portfolio, and (c) identifying loss factors not fully captured within the models or economic forecasts (e.g., asset specific factors or current conditions that are different from this historical loss information captured in the models) and quantifying those estimates in qualitative components. 
 
 The ACL for loans or leases is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets. The ACL is generally determined using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The fair value of the collateral is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans, less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral. 
 
 Given the size of the loan and lease portfolios and the subjective nature of estimating the ACL, auditing the ACL involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the ACL for the loan and lease portfolios included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the (i) selection of the macroeconomic forecasts, (ii) execution and monitoring of the loss rate models, (iii) calibration of the loss rate models to peer and industry information, (iv) measurement of the qualitative allowance, (v) the monitoring, identification, and valuation of collateral dependent loans, and (vi) overall calculation and disclosure of the ACL. 
 We used our credit and valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness of the loss rate models and valuation of collateral dependent loans. 
 We (i) evaluated the reasonableness of the loss rate models and related assumptions, (ii) assessed the reasonableness of design, theory, and logic of the loss rate models for estimating expected credit losses, (iii) tested the accuracy of the data input into the loss rate models, and (iv) assessed the reasonableness of the models calculations of loss rates derived from the loss rate models. 
 We (i) assessed the reasonableness of the methodologies and appraisals used by management to estimate collateral values on collateral dependent loans, (ii) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the reserves or charge-offs, and (iii) considered available information subsequent to December 31, 2022 that provides additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. 
 We (i) evaluated the reasonableness of management s forecast selection, (ii) evaluated the appropriateness and relevance of the qualitative factors, and related quantitative measures included in the qualitative allowance, (iii) tested the accuracy and evaluated the relevance and reliability of the data, including third party data, used to calibrate the loss rate models to peer and industry information, and (iv) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the qualitative allowance. 
 We tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the overall ACL and assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Customers Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Customers Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company, and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Loans Receivable, PPP 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") was enacted on March 27, 2020, which included the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") designed to aid small-and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers is a participant in the PPP. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and may be eligible for forgiveness by the SBA to the extent that the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1 and terms of two or five years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred for the first six months of the loan. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1 to 5 based on the size of the loan. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 ("CAA") was signed into law, including Division N, Title III, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, which provided 284 billion in additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was enacted expanding eligibility for first and second round of PPP loans and revising the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP loans authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 had the same general loan terms as the first and second round, and a processing fee of up to 2,500 per loan of less than 50,000, and 1 to 3 for loans greater than 50,000. Customers classified the PPP loans as held for investment and these loans are carried at amortized cost and interest income is recognized using the interest method. The origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the related loans over their contractual life using the interest method. Customers has elected to not estimate prepayments as a policy election. No ACL has been recognized for PPP loans as these eligible loans are 100 guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to NOTE 8 LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES for additional information.

days past due or when management has doubts about further collectibility of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is well secured. When a loan or lease is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest previously credited to interest income is reversed. Interest received on non-accrual loans and leases is generally applied against principal until all principal has been recovered. Thereafter, payments are recognized as interest income until all unpaid amounts have been received. Generally, loans and leases are restored to accrual status when the loan is brought current and has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a minimum of , and the ultimate collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

or less. Home equity loans have additional risks as a result of typically being in a second position or lower in the event collateral is liquidated. 
 Manufactured housing loans are loans that are secured by the manufactured housing unit where the borrower may or may not own the underlying real estate and therefore have a higher risk than a residential real estate loan. 
 Installment loans consist primarily of unsecured loans to individuals which are originated through Customers' retail network or acquired through purchases from third parties, primarily market place lenders. None of the installment loans held for investment are sub-prime at the time of origination. Customers considers sub-prime borrowers to be those with FICO scores below 660. Installment loans have a greater credit risk than residential loans because of the difference in the underlying collateral, if any. The application of various federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
 127 

days of delinquency or sooner when cash flows are determined to be insufficient for repayment. Customers may also charge-off these loans below the net appraised valuation if Customers holds a junior-mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior-mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately sell the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, Customers may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full. 
 Credit Quality Factors 
 Commercial and industrial, multifamily, commercial real estate and construction loans and leases are each assigned a numerical rating of risk based on an internal risk-rating system. The risk rating is assigned at loan origination and indicates management's estimate of credit quality. Risk ratings are reviewed on a periodic or as needed basis. Residential real estate, manufactured housing and installment loans are evaluated primarily based on payment activity of the loan. Risk ratings are not established for residential real estate, home equity loans, manufactured housing and installment loans, mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of homogeneous loans with smaller balances. Instead, these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history (through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends). For additional information about credit quality risk ratings refer to NOTE 8 LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 
 Customers estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which it is exposed to credit risk on contractual obligations to extend credit, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by Customers. The ACL on lending-related commitments is recorded in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and is recorded as a provision for credit losses within other non-interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives. Customers estimates the expected credit losses for undrawn commitments using a usage given default calculation. The lifetime loss rates for off-balance sheet credit exposures are calculated in the same manner as on-balance sheet credit exposures, using the same models and economic forecasts, adjusted for the estimated likelihood that funding will occur. Refer to NOTE 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK for additional information regarding Customers' ACL on lending related commitments.

percent; the term upon examination includes resolution of the related appeals or litigation process. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management s judgment. 
 In assessing the realizability of federal or state deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and prudent, feasible and permissible as well as available tax planning strategies in making this assessment.

 At December 31, 2022, there were AFS debt securities with unrealized losses in the less-than-twelve-months category and AFS debt securities with unrealized losses in the twelve-months-or-more category. Except for the asset-backed securities where there was a deterioration in future estimated cash flows as further discussed below, the unrealized losses were principally due to changes in market interest rates that resulted in a negative impact on the respective securities' fair value and expected to be recovered when market prices recover or at maturity. Customers does not intend to sell any of the securities, and it is not more likely than not that Customers will be required to sell any of the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2021, there were AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position. 
 Customers recorded an allowance for credit losses on asset-backed securities where there was a deterioration in future estimated cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2022. A discounted cash flow approach is used to determine the amount of the allowance. The cash flows expected to be collected, after considering expected prepayments, are discounted at the original effective interest rate. The amount of the allowance is limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its estimated fair value.

 (1) Accrued interest on HTM debt securities totaled million at December 31, 2022, and is included in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 In June 2022, Customers transferred million in net carrying value of certain debt securities from available for sale to held to maturity as a part of Customers' ongoing asset liability management primarily to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on the long duration component of the investment portfolio. At the time of transfer to held to maturity, these debt securities had unrealized losses of million, which, along with the unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income, will be amortized over the remaining terms of the securities as an adjustment to yield (interest income) using the effective interest method resulting in no impact to current period earnings. 
 On September 30, 2022, Customers sold consumer installment loans with a carrying value of million, inclusive of accrued interest and unamortized deferred loan origination costs, to a third-party sponsored VIE. As part of these sales, Customers recognized a loss on sale of million in loss on sale of consumer installment loans within non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Customers provided financing to the purchaser for a portion of the sale price in the form of million of asset-backed securities, presented in the table above, collateralized by the sold loans. Customers acts as the servicer for the sold consumer installment loans, and receives a servicing fee. 
 At the time of the sale, and at each subsequent reporting period, Customers is required to evaluate its involvement with the VIE to determine if it holds a variable interest in the VIE and, if so, if Customers is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If Customers is both a variable interest holder and the primary beneficiary of the VIE, it would be required to consolidate the VIE. As of December 31, 2022, Customers concluded that its investment in asset-backed securities as well as the servicing fee are considered variable interests in the VIE as there is a possibility, even if remote, that would result in Customers' interest in the asset-backed securities or the servicing fee absorbing some of the losses of the VIE.

Agency-guaranteed residential mortgage-backed securities Agency-guaranteed commercial mortgage-backed securities Agency-guaranteed residential collateralized mortgage obligations Agency-guaranteed commercial collateralized mortgage obligations Private label collateralized mortgage obligations Total held to maturity debt securities 
 Customers recorded allowance for credit losses on investment securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2022. The U.S. government agency securities represent obligations issued by a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or other federal government agency that are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. federal government and therefore, assumed to have zero credit losses. The private label collateralized mortgage obligations are highly rated with sufficient overcollateralization and therefore have zero expected credit losses. Customers recorded allowance for its investment in the asset-backed securities related to the sale of consumer installment loans to a third-party sponsored VIE as of December 31, 2022. Customers considered the seniority of its beneficial interest, which includes its overcollateralization of these securities in the estimate of the ACL at December 31, 2022. The unrealized losses on HTM debt securities with no ACL were due to changes in market interest rates that resulted in a negative impact on the respective securities' fair value and are expected to be recovered when market prices recover or at maturity. 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 Customers monitors the credit quality of HTM debt securities primarily through credit ratings provided by rating agencies. Investment grade debt securities are rated BBB- or higher by S P Global Ratings, Baa3 or higher by Moody's Investors Service or equivalent ratings by other rating agencies, and are generally considered to be of low credit risk. Except for the asset-backed securities, all of the HTM debt securities held by Customers were investment grade or U.S. government agency guaranteed securities that were not rated at December 31, 2022. The asset-backed securities classified as HTM debt securities in connection with the sale of the consumer installment loans to a third-party sponsored VIE are not rated by rating agencies. Customers monitors the credit quality of these asset-backed securities by evaluating the performance of the sold consumer installment loans against the overcollateralization available for these asset-backed securities.

 Restricted Stock Units 
 The fair value of restricted stock units granted under the 2019 and 2004 Plans is determined based on the closing market price of Customers' common stock on the date of grant, except for the performance based restricted stock units with market conditions under a long-term incentive compensation plan discussed below. The fair value of the performance based restricted stock units with market conditions is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock units granted under the BRRP was measured as of the date on which such portion of the bonus would have been paid had the deferral not been elected. 
 Beginning in 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board of Directors approved a new long-term incentive compensation plan which incorporates performance metrics into the restricted stock awards for certain of Customers' key officers. Specifically, of the restricted stock units granted as long term incentive compensation will vest ratably over . The number of restricted stock units that will vest for the remaining is dependent upon Customers meeting certain performance metrics, including total shareholder return, return on average common equity, and average non-performing assets ("NPAs") to total assets over a three -year period relative to the performance of its peer group. The performance conditions are considered probable. 
 There were restricted stock units granted during the year ended December 31, 2022. The units were granted under the 2019 Plan and are subject to either a three -year waterfall vesting (with one third of the amount vesting annually) or a three -year cliff vesting, with of those units also subject to the performance metrics described above.

 Unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans Unfunded commitments under lines of credit and credit cards Letters of credit Other unused commitments 
 Commitments to fund loans and leases, unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans, unfunded commitments under lines of credit, letters of credit, and credit cards are agreements to extend credit to or for the benefit of a customer in the ordinary course of the Bank's business. 
 Commitments to fund loans and leases and unfunded commitments under lines of credit may be obligations of the Bank as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if the Bank deems it necessary upon extension of credit, is based upon management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. 
 Mortgage warehouse loan commitments are agreements to fund the pipelines of mortgage banking businesses from closing of individual mortgage loans until their sale into the secondary market. Most of the individual mortgage loans are insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government through one of its programs such as FHA, VA, or are conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

 In April 2020, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that permits banks to exclude the impact of participating in the SBA PPP program in their regulatory capital ratios. Specifically, PPP loans are zero percent risk weighted and a bank can exclude all PPP loans pledged as collateral to the PPPLF from its average total consolidated assets for purposes of calculating the Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio (i.e. leverage ratio). Customers applied this regulatory guidance in the calculation of its regulatory capital ratios presented below. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank and the Bancorp to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined in the regulations). At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank and the Bancorp satisfied all capital requirements to which they were subject.

 The Basel III Capital Rules require that we maintain a capital conservation buffer with respect to each of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of Customers financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 Investment securities: 
 The fair values of equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, AFS debt securities and debt securities reported at fair value based on a fair value option election are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized and foreign securities exchanges (Level 1), quoted prices in markets that are not active (Level 2), matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices, or internally and externally developed models that use unobservable inputs due to limited or no market activity of the instrument (Level 3). 
 When quoted market prices are not available, Customers employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has an established process to challenge their valuations, or methodologies, that appear unusual or unexpected. 
 Customers also utilizes internally and externally developed models that use unobservable inputs due to limited or no market activity of the instrument. These models use unobservable inputs that are inherently judgmental and reflect our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. Certain unobservable inputs in isolation may have either a directionally consistent or opposite impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. When multiple inputs are used within the valuation techniques, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change from another input. These assets are classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. 
 Loans held for sale - Residential mortgage loans (fair value option): 
 Customers generally estimates the fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. These assets are classified as Level 2 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. 
 171 

days from purchase to sale. These assets are classified as Level 2 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. 
 Derivatives (assets and liabilities): 
 The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and credit derivatives are determined using models that incorporate readily observable market data into a market standard methodology. This methodology nets the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments. The discounted variable cash receipts and payments are based on expectations of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves. In addition, fair value is adjusted for the effect of nonperformance risk by incorporating credit valuation adjustments for Customers and its counterparties. These assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. 
 The fair values of the residential mortgage loan commitments are derived from the estimated fair values that can be generated when the underlying mortgage loan is sold in the secondary market. Customers generally uses commitments on hand from third-party investors to estimate an exit price and adjusts for the probability of the commitment being exercised based on Customers' internal experience (i.e., pull-through rate). These assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. 
 Derivative assets and liabilities are presented in other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Collateral-dependent loans: 
 Collateral-dependent loans are those loans that are accounted for under ASC 326, in which the Bank has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan s collateral or DCF analysis. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the properties that collateralize the loans, DCF based upon the expected proceeds, sales agreements or letters of intent with third parties. These assets are generally classified as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. 
 The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of Customers' fair value in its entirety because fair value calculations are only provided for a limited portion of Customers' assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making these estimates, comparisons between Customers' disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.

 NOTE 21 
 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest-Rate Risk 
 Customers objectives in using interest-rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, Customers primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Customers making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
 The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged item affects earnings. To date, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the forecasted issuances of debt and a certain variable-rate deposit relationship. 
 Customers discontinues cash flow hedge accounting if it is probable the forecasted hedged transactions will not occur in the initially identified time period. At such time, the associated gains and losses deferred in AOCI are reclassified immediately into earnings and any subsequent changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Customers terminated interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest-rate risk associated with 3-month FHLB advances, and reclassified million of the realized losses and accrued interest from AOCI to current earnings because the hedged forecasted transactions were determined to be no longer probable of occurring.

outstanding interest rate derivative designated as cash flow hedges of interest-rate risk. 
 Fair Value Hedges of Benchmark Interest-Rate Risk 
 Customers is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed rate AFS debt securities due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Customers uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate such as the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for Customers receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. 
 At December 31, 2022, Customers had outstanding interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million that were designated as fair value hedges of certain AFS debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Customers terminated interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million that were designated as fair value hedges together with the sale of hedged AFS debt securities. At December 31, 2021, Customers had outstanding interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million designated as fair value hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Customers terminated interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million that were designated as fair value hedges together with the sale of hedged AFS debt securities. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 Customers executes interest rate swaps (typically the loan customers will swap a floating-rate loan for a fixed-rate loan) and interest rate caps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The customer interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps and interest rate caps that Customers executes with a third party in order to minimize interest-rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps associated with this program do not meet the hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and caps and the offsetting third-party market swaps and caps are recognized directly in earnings. At December 31, 2022, Customers had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion and interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of million related to this program. At December 31, 2021, Customers had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion and interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of million related to this program. 
 Customers enters into residential mortgage loan commitments in connection with its consumer mortgage banking activities to fund mortgage loans at specified rates and times in the future. These commitments are short-term in nature and generally expire in to days. The residential mortgage loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting guidance and are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded directly in earnings. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had an outstanding notional amount of residential mortgage loan commitments of million and million, respectively. 
 Customers has also purchased and sold credit derivatives to either hedge or participate in the performance risk associated with some of its counterparties. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments and are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value reported directly in earnings. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Customers had outstanding notional amount of credit derivatives of million and million, respectively.

 Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
 By entering into derivative contracts, Customers is exposed to credit risk. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is the same as that involved in extending the related loans and is subject to the same standard credit policies. To mitigate the credit-risk exposure to major derivative dealer counterparties, Customers only enters into agreements with those counterparties that maintain credit ratings of high quality or with central clearing parties. 
 Agreements with major derivative dealer counterparties contain provisions whereby default on any of Customers' indebtedness would be considered a default on its derivative obligations. Customers also has entered into agreements that contain provisions under which the counterparty could require Customers to settle its obligations if Customers fails to maintain its status as a well/adequately capitalized institution. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of derivatives in a net asset position (which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance-risk) related to these agreements was million. In addition, Customers, which has collateral posting thresholds with certain of these counterparties, had received million of cash as collateral at December 31, 2022. Customers records cash posted or received as collateral with these counterparties, except with a central clearing entity, as a reduction or an increase in the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents and an increase in the balance of other assets or other liabilities.
