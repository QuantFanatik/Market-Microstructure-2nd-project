 Purpose, Values and Corporate Responsibility 
 At AB, we pursue insight that unlocks opportunity. This is our firm's purpose. Together with our firm's mission and values, which we have described below , our purpose forms the foundation of responsibility at AB. 
 AB's mission is to help our clients define and achieve their investment goals, explicitly stating what we do each day to unlock opportunity for our clients. As an active manager, our differentiated insights drive our ability to deliver alpha and design innovative investment solutions. ESG and climate issues are key elements in forming insights and in presenting potential risks and opportunities that can impact the performance of the companies and issuers in which we invest and the portfolios that we build. 
 Our values provide a framework for the behaviors and actions that deliver on our purpose and mission. Values align our actions. Each value emerges from our firm's character, yet also is aspirational, and each value challenges us to become a better, more responsible version of AB: 
 We invest in each other, meaning that we have a strong organizational culture in which diversity is celebrated and mentorship is critical to our success. 
 We strive for distinctive insight, meaning that we collaboratively identify creative solutions to clients' economic, ESG and climate-related investment challenges through our expertise in a wide range of investment disciplines. 
 We speak with courage and conviction, which informs how we engage with our AB colleagues and issuers. 
 We act with integrity, which is the bedrock of our relationships and drives us to avoid activities that could create potential conflicts of interest or distract us from our singular focus to provide asset management and research to our clients. 
 As noted above , we consistently challenge ourselves to become a better version of AB. We are committed to being a responsible firm and striving to model the behavior that we expect from the companies in which we invest. This means, in part, giving back to the communities in which we work through our firm-wide philanthropic initiative, AB Gives Back, and reducing our environmental footprint by increasing our use of green buildings, such as our new corporate headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. Additionally, by promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, we are afforded different perspectives and ways of thinking, which can lead to better outcomes for our clients See Diversity, Equity and Inclusion below in this Item 1 ). 
 Also, striving to be more responsible gives us a richer perspective for evaluating other companies. As longtime fundamental investors with a strong research heritage, we consider ESG factors in various processes. This helps us make fully informed risk/return assessments and draw insightful investment conclusions. Our investors research analysts and portfolio managers understand the companies and industries they cover in-depth. This positions them well to determine which ESG issues are material to particular companies, to determine the financial impact of an ESG issue and to incorporate that insight into their cash-flow, earnings and credit models. And, we continue to invest in technology and innovation to further enable our investment teams to formalize their ESG evaluations and share insights from our engagements with other companies. 
 Additionally, AB has prioritized our employees' health and welfare throughout the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring that our firm has continued to meet our fiduciary obligations and provide exceptional client service and thoughtful investment advice. Furthermore, COVID-19 is a prominent theme in engagement: it not only impacts business models but also highlights corporate ESG practices. We are advocating that issuers be responsible corporate citizens, and we are working to better understand opportunities and threats, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, fueled by the pandemic. 
 We provide additional information in this regard in the AB Responsibility Report, which can be found under Responsibility - Overview on www.alliancebernstein.com. And, we have described our firm's governance structure, including our Board and its committees, in Item 10 of this Form 10-K.

The open-end U.S. Funds have entered into such agreements with us, and we have entered into selling and distribution agreements pursuant to which we pay sales commissions to the financial intermediaries that distribute our open-end U.S. Funds. These agreements are terminable by either party upon notice (generally 30 days) and do not obligate the financial intermediary to sell any specific amount of fund shares. 
 As of December 31, 2022, retail U.S. Fund AUM were approximately 54 billion, or 22 of retail AUM, as compared to 73 billion, or 23 , as of December 31, 2021, and 62 billion, or 23 , as of December 31, 2020.

 Bernstein Research Services 
 We offer high-quality fundamental and quantitative research and trade execution services in equities and listed options to institutional investors, such as mutual fund and hedge fund managers, pension funds and other institutional investors "Bernstein Research Services" or " BRS " . We serve our clients, which are based in major markets around the world, through our trading professionals, who are primarily based in New York, London and Hong Kong, and our research analysts, who provide fundamental company and industry research along with quantitative research into securities valuation and factors affecting stock-price movements. 
 Additionally, we occasionally provide equity capital markets services to issuers of publicly traded securities, such as initial public offerings and follow-on offerings, generally acting as co-manager in such offerings. 
 We earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser but increasing extent, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments. Bernstein Research Services accounted for approximately 10 , 10 and 12 of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 For information regarding trends in fee rates charged for brokerage transactions, see Risk Factors in Item 1A . 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, AB and Soci t G n rale (EURONEXT: SCGLY, SocGen , a leading European bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses.

 Custody 
 Our U.S. based broker-dealer subsidiary acts as custodian for the majority of our Private Wealth Management AUM and some of our Institutional AUM. Other custodian arrangements, directed by clients, include banks, trust companies, brokerage firms and other financial institutions. 
 People Management 
 As a leading global investment management and research firm, we bring together a wide range of insights, expertise and innovations to advance the interests of our clients around the world. The intellectual capital and distinctive knowledge of our employees are collectively the most important assets of our firm, so the long-term sustainability and success of our firm is heavily dependent on our people. In 2022, our human capital and administrative services teams became our "People" team, a key acknowledgement of the central role they play in supporting our employees and advancing their work experience. We are keenly focused on: 
 fostering an inclusive culture by incorporating diversity, equity and inclusion in all levels of our business; 
 encouraging innovation; 
 developing, retaining and recruiting high quality talent; and 
 aligning employees incentives and risk taking with those of the firm. 
 As a result, we have a strong firm culture that helps us maximize performance and drive excellence. Further, our firm s role as a fiduciary is embedded in our culture. As a fiduciary, our firm s primary objective is to act in our clients' best interests and help them reach their financial goals. 
 Also, our Board of Directors (the " Board ") and committees of the Board, particularly our Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee, provide oversight into various matters affecting our people, including emerging people management risks and strategies to mitigate our exposure to those risks. Furthermore, our Board and Board committees evaluate the overall effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs and recommend changes to management as necessary. These collaborative efforts contribute to the overall framework that guides how AB attracts, retains and develops a workforce that supports our values and strategic initiatives.

 Talent Acquisition 
 AB seeks to achieve excellence in business and investment performance by recruiting and hiring a workforce with diversity of thought, backgrounds and experiences. We believe that diverse and inclusive teams generate better ideas and reach more balanced decisions. We seek to leverage the unique backgrounds of our employees to meet the needs of a broad range of clients and engage with the communities in which we operate. We engage several external organizations to assist in attracting and recruiting top talent at all levels, with a particular focus on attracting diverse talent. We have a sizable group of internal talent acquisition associates focused on recruiting, and we have implemented various people-related initiatives to develop and provide for a balanced workforce. Additionally, we offer internship programs for students to work in positions across functional areas of the firm, and an important part of our emerging talent and post-graduate recruitment strategy is to convert a high percentage of our interns into full-time employees. 
 Employee Engagement 
 We believe a workforce is most productive, effective and highly engaged when they feel connected to our business and culture. We seek to provide diverse work experiences, professional development opportunities, competitive compensation and benefits, an inclusive and diverse culture and social engagement projects to keep our employees motivated, connected to our firm and engaged throughout their careers. We strive to create a culture of intellectual curiosity and collaboration, creating an environment where our employees can thrive and do their best work. We foster growth and advancement through different training avenues to develop skill sets, create opportunities for networking, both internally and externally, and we encourage internal mobility as a part of our employees' career trajectory. 
 It is important that our employees are not only connected to our business but also to the communities in which we operate. As such, AB offers many opportunities for our employees to volunteer in the communities in which we serve, including our firm-wide philanthropic initiative, AB Gives Back. Other initiatives in support of these objectives include a five-year refresh award, whereby employees receive two additional weeks off for every five years of service. In addition, we utilize AB Voice, a periodic survey designed to measure employee satisfaction and engagement, allowing us to identify and address performance gaps. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Our continued commitment to Diversity, Equity Inclusion (" DEI ") across all facets of our firm aligns with broader industry recognition of the workplace as both a working and learning community. We believe that our company plays a critical role in empowering our people though purpose and fostering an inclusive, collaborative environment and equitable culture that allows for connectivity, belonging and success at every level. 
 A key element of our ongoing journey has been to adapt as appropriate to evolving DEI industry trends. In 2022, we formally incorporated the concept of "equity" into our strategy and team name in an effort to more accurately reflect our current and anticipated approach. 
 Our firm's community engagement efforts have been further integrated under the DEI umbrella. To support our grantee and community partners, bolster our commitment to our non-profit clients, and add value for our current and future employees, our approach leverages four programs under the "AB Gives Back" brand: philanthropy, volunteering, board participation and gift matching. Some highlights include improved student attendance and financial literacy in inner city neighborhoods and over 3,000 employee volunteer hours completed in 2022. 
 We have enhanced our talent attraction and retention approach to position ourselves as an employer of choice and increase investment in our people. We have developed a diverse talent strategy with a goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the needs of diverse talent and also equipping managers with the necessary tools to effectively manage an increasingly diverse workforce. The strategy includes incorporating the concept of inclusive leadership into the firm-wide leadership development curriculum and providing opportunities to build relationships across the firm at all levels. 
 Finally, our people remain our top priority. Over the course of the last year, there has been a continued focus on education and deepening engagement across all pillars of our strategy to include Employee Resource Groups (" ERGs "), corporate partnerships, and the overall experience at AB. ERGs have been a major proponent of these efforts by cultivating spaces for courageous conversations, encouraging professional development and personal wellness, and raising awareness for various underrepresented communities.

 Compensation and Benefits 
 We consistently invest in our workforce by offering competitive compensation. We utilize a variety of compensation elements, including base salaries, annual short-term compensation awards (i.e., cash bonuses) and, for those of our employees who earn more than 300,000 annually, a long-term compensation award program. Long-term incentive compensation awards generally are denominated in restricted AB Holding Units. We utilize this structure to foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of our employees directly with the interests of our Unitholders and indirectly with the interests of our clients, as strong performance for our clients generally contributes directly to increases in AUM and improved financial performance for the firm. Furthermore, in the U.S. (and elsewhere, although benefits may differ by jurisdiction): 
 We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, performance, experience, knowledge and geographic location. 
 We engage nationally recognized compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs, as well as consulting services relating to the amount and form of compensation paid to employees other than executives, and to provide benchmarking against our industry peers; this process also includes engagement of outside counsel to conduct privileged pay equity reviews to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 We provide merit-based and cost of living annual salary increases, as well as incentive compensation, which are communicated to employees at year-end and documented through our annual review procedures, upon internal transfer and/or promotion; and 
 The firm makes benefits available to all eligible employees, including a flexible in-office work schedule that permits working remotely two days weekly, health and prescription insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, paid parental leave, adoption and surrogacy assistance, tuition reimbursement, and a health and financial wellness program. 
 Health, Safety and Flexibility for our Workforce 
 During 2020, at the onset of COVID, we mobilized to ensure the health and safety of our employees globally. We implemented business continuity measures, including travel restrictions and a work-from-home requirement for almost all personnel (other than a relatively small number of employees whose physical presence in our offices was considered critical), which lasted through the second quarter of 2021. Then, while continuing to closely monitor COVID-related conditions globally, we developed return-to-office programs tailored locally, so that employees could feel safe knowing that their health, and the health of their families, were a priority. This meant a staggered return to the office so that we could monitor data while complying with local ordinances. 
 Beginning in July 2021, in the U.S. we returned to the office three days a week, alternating weeks through the end of 2021. In early 2022, while most of our employees returned to the office full-time, we offered employees the ability to work remotely up to two days per week given the ability and diligence our employees demonstrated while working remotely. By the end of 2022, all employees had returned to the office utilizing a hybrid work schedule, including the flexibility to work remotely up to two days per week. We believe this approach allows our employees to maintain the important benefits of in-person collaboration while providing greater work-life balance. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2022, our firm had 4,436 full-time employees, including 203 AB CarVal employees, compared to 4,118 full-time employees as of December 31, 2021, representing a 7.7 increase (a 2.8 increase excluding AB CarVal).

 History and Structure 
 We have been in the investment research and management business for more than 50 years. Bernstein was founded in 1967. Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment management department of Donaldson, Lufkin Jenrette, Inc. (since November 2000, a part of Credit Suisse Group) merged with the investment advisory business of Moody s Investors Service, Inc. 
 In April 1988, AB Holding went public as a master limited partnership. AB Holding Units, which trade under the ticker symbol AB, have been listed on the NYSE since that time. 
 In October 1999, AB Holding reorganized by transferring its business and assets to AB, a newly-formed operating partnership, in exchange for all of the AB Units (the Reorganization ). Since the date of the Reorganization, AB has conducted the business formerly conducted by AB Holding and AB Holding s activities have consisted of owning AB Units and engaging in related activities. Unlike AB Holding Units, AB Units do not trade publicly and are subject to significant restrictions on transfer. The General Partner is the general partner of both AB and AB Holding. 
 In October 2000, our two legacy firms, Alliance Capital and Bernstein, combined, bringing together Alliance Capital s expertise in growth equity and corporate fixed income investing and its family of retail mutual funds, with Bernstein s expertise in value equity investing, tax-exempt fixed income management, and its Private Wealth Management and Bernstein Research Services businesses.

 As of December 31, 2022, the condensed ownership structure of AB is as follows (for a more complete description of our ownership structure, see Principal Security Holders in Item 12 ): 
 
 The General Partner owns 100,000 general partnership units in AB Holding and a 1 general partnership interest in AB. Including these general partnership interests, EQH, directly and through certain of its subsidiaries see Principal Security Holders in Item 12 ), had an approximate 61.3 economic interest in AB as of December 31, 2022. 
 Competition 
 We compete in all aspects of our business with numerous investment management firms, mutual fund sponsors, brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives as those we offer. Our competitors offer a wide range of financial services to the same customers that we seek to serve. Some of our competitors are larger, have a broader range of product choices and investment capabilities, conduct business in more markets, and have substantially greater resources than we do. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current client relationships, and create new ones, will be successful. 
 In addition, EQH and its subsidiaries provide financial services, some of which compete with those we offer. The AB Partnership Agreement specifically allows EQH and its subsidiaries (other than the General Partner) to compete with AB and to pursue opportunities that may be available to us. EQH and certain of its subsidiaries have substantially greater financial resources than we do and are not obligated to provide resources to us. 
 To grow our business, we believe we must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include: 
 our investment performance for clients; 
 our commitment to place the interests of our clients first; 
 the quality of our research; 
 our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, personnel; 
 the array of investment products we offer; 
 the fees we charge; 
 Morningstar/Lipper rankings for the AB Funds; 
 our ability to sell our actively-managed investment services despite the fact that many investors favor passive services; 
 our operational effectiveness; 
 our ability to further develop and market our brand; and 
 our global presence. 
 Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with the other factors we discuss in Risk Factors in Item 1A .

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Please consider this section along with the description of our business in Item 1 , the competition section immediately above and AB s financial information contained in Items 7 and 8 . The majority of the risk factors discussed below directly affect AB. These risk factors also affect AB Holding because AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB. See also Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 . 
 Business-related Risks 
 Our revenues and results of operations depend on the market value and composition of our AUM, which can fluctuate significantly based on various factors, including many factors outside of our control. 
 We derive most of our revenues from investment advisory and services fees, which typically are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of the account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. The value and composition of our AUM can be adversely affected by several factors, including: 
 Market Factors . Our AUM remain sensitive to the volatility associated with global financial market conditions. For example, the dramatic securities market declines experienced during March 2020, which resulted from the global effects of COVID-19, caused a significant reduction in our AUM. Markets and AUM levels recovered to new highs in 2021 following unprecedented, coordinated monetary and fiscal policy support and the approval of vaccines to help remedy the global pandemic. However, significant supply chain challenges, energy shortages and labor shortages, brought about by COVID-19 and significantly exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, contributed to heightened global inflationary pressures, which resulted in sizable interest rate increases and associated market volatility in 2022. We recognize that, due to continued uncertainty associated with these circumstances, markets may remain volatile and, accordingly, there remains risk of a significant reduction in our revenues and net income in future periods. Global economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, which increases the probability that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact a different country or region. Conditions affecting the general economy, including political, social or economic instability at the local, regional or global level may also affect the market value of our AUM. Health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other incidents that interrupt the expected course of events, such as natural disasters, war (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism (whether foreign or domestic), power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, and the public response to or fear of such diseases or events, have had and may in the future have a significant adverse effect on financial markets and our AUM, revenues and net income. Furthermore, the preventative and protective health-related actions, such as business activity suspensions and population lock-downs, that governments have taken, and may continue to take, in response to COVID-19 have resulted, and may continue to result, in periods of business interruption, inability to obtain raw materials, supplies and component parts, and reduced or disrupted operations. Also, significant market volatility and uncertainty, and reductions in the availability of margin financing, can significantly limit the liquidity of certain asset backed and other securities, making it at times impossible to sell these securities at prices reflecting their true economic value. While liquidity conditions were relatively stable in 2022 despite market volatility, we recognize the possibility that conditions could deteriorate in the future. Lack of liquidity makes it more difficult for our funds to meet redemption requests. If liquidity were to worsen, this may have a significant adverse effect on our AUM, revenues and net income in the future. 
 Client Preferences . Generally, our clients may withdraw their assets at any time and on short notice. Also, changing market dynamics and investment trends, particularly with respect to sponsors of defined benefit plans choosing to invest in less risky investments and the ongoing shift to lower-fee passive services described below, may continue to reduce interest in some of the investment products we offer, and/or clients and prospects may continue to seek investment products that we may not currently offer. Loss of, or decreases in, AUM reduces our investment advisory and services fees and revenues. 
 18 
 AllianceBernstein 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 Our Investment Performance . Our ability to achieve investment returns for clients that meet or exceed investment returns for comparable asset classes and competing investment services is a key consideration when clients decide to keep their assets with us or invest additional assets, and when a prospective client is deciding whether to invest with us. Poor investment performance, both in absolute terms and/or relative to peers and stated benchmarks, may result in clients withdrawing assets and prospective clients choosing to invest with competitors. 
 Investing Trends . Our fee rates can vary significantly among the various investment products and services we offer to our clients see Net Revenues in Item 7 for additional information regarding our fee rates); our fee realization rate fluctuates as clients shift assets between accounts or products with different fee structures. 
 Service Changes . We may be required to reduce our fee levels, restructure the fees we charge and/or adjust the services we offer to our clients because of, among other things, regulatory initiatives (whether industry-wide or specifically targeted), changing technology in the asset management business (including algorithmic strategies and emerging financial technology), court decisions and competitive considerations. A reduction in fee levels would reduce our revenues. 
 Interest Rate Changes . Investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income and multi-asset investment portfolios can be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly if interest rates increase substantially and quickly. 
 A decrease in the value of our AUM, a decrease in the amount of AUM we manage, an adverse mix shift in our AUM and/or a reduction in the level of fees we charge would adversely affect our investment advisory fees and revenues. A reduction in revenues, without a commensurate reduction in expenses, adversely affects our results of operations. 
 The industry-wide shift from actively managed investment services to passive services has adversely affected our investment advisory and services fees, revenues and results of operations, and this trend may continue. 
 Our competitive environment has become increasingly difficult, as active managers, which invest based on individual security selection, have, on average, consistently underperformed passive services, which invest based on market indices. Active performance relative to benchmarks as of mid-2022 deteriorated from prior-year levels, with 40 of active managers outperforming their passive benchmarks for the 12 months ended June 30, 2022 (latest data available), compared to 47 for the prior 12-month period. U.S. stock active funds fared better than non-U.S. with 45 of U.S. active stock funds outperforming benchmarks, as compared with 23 for non-U.S. stock funds. Performance of actively managed bond funds decreased sharply in 2022, with just 29 outperforming benchmarks, representing a 44 decline compared to the prior-year period. 
 Flows into actively managed funds deteriorated industry-wide in 2022, with U.S. industry-wide active mutual fund outflows of 974 billion in 2022, contrasted with inflows of 148 billion in 2021. Active fixed income U.S. mutual funds experienced outflows of 482 billion in 2022, compared to inflows of 368 billion in 2021. Furthermore, active equity U.S. mutual fund outflows accelerated to 432 billion in 2022, compared to outflows of 191 billion in 2021. By contrast, demand for passive strategies in the U.S. continued to grow, though at a reduced rate from the prior year, as industry-wide total passive mutual fund net inflows of 518 billion in 2022 compared to 928 billion in 2021. Organic growth through net inflows continues to be difficult to achieve for active managers, such as AB, and requires taking market share from other active managers. 
 The significant shift from active services to passive services adversely affects Bernstein Research Services revenues as well. Institutional global market trading volumes continue to be pressured (notwithstanding the heightened market volatility and trading volume predominantly relating to COVID-19 in the first half of 2020) by persistent active equity outflows and passive equity inflows. As a result, portfolio turnover has declined and investors hold fewer shares that are actively traded by managers. 
 Our reputation could suffer if we are unable to deliver consistent, competitive investment performance. 
 Our business is based on the trust and confidence of our clients. Damage to our reputation, resulting from poor or inconsistent investment performance, among other factors, can reduce substantially our AUM and impair our ability to maintain or grow our business. 
 EQH and its subsidiaries provide a significant amount of our AUM and fund a significant portion of our seed investments, and if our agreements with them terminate or they withdraw capital support it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. 
 EQH (our parent company) and its subsidiaries constitute our largest client. Our EQH affiliates represented approximately 16 of our AUM as of December 31, 2022, and we earned approximately 4 of our net revenues from services we provided to them. Our related investment management agreements are terminable at any time or on short notice by either party, and EQH is not under any obligation to maintain any level of AUM with us. A material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could result if EQH were to terminate its investment management agreements with us. 
 2022 Annual Report 19 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 Our business is dependent on investment advisory agreements with clients, and selling and distribution agreements with various financial intermediaries and consultants, which generally are subject to termination or non-renewal on short notice. 
 We derive most of our revenues pursuant to written investment management agreements (or other arrangements) with institutional investors, mutual funds and private wealth clients, and selling and distribution agreements with financial intermediaries that distribute AB Funds. Generally, the investment management agreements (and other arrangements), including our agreements with EQH and its subsidiaries, are terminable at any time or upon relatively short notice by either party. The investment management agreements pursuant to which we manage the U.S. Funds must be renewed and approved by the Funds boards of directors annually. A significant majority of the directors are independent. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund will approve the fund s investment management agreement each year, or will not condition its approval on revised terms that may be adverse to us. In addition, investors in AB Funds can redeem their investments without notice. Any termination of, or failure to renew, a significant number of these agreements, or a significant increase in redemption rates, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Similarly, the selling and distribution agreements with securities firms, brokers, banks and other financial intermediaries are terminable by either party upon notice (generally 30 days) and do not obligate the financial intermediary to sell any specific amount of fund shares. These intermediaries generally offer their clients investment products that compete with our products. In addition, certain institutional investors rely on consultants to advise them about choosing an investment adviser and some of our services may not be considered among the best choices by these consultants. As a result, investment consultants may advise their clients to move their assets invested with us to other investment advisers, which could result in significant net outflows. 
 Lastly, our Private Wealth Services rely on referrals from financial planners, registered investment advisers and other professionals. We cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to, or receive referrals from, these third parties. Loss of such access or referrals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Performance-based fee arrangements with our clients may cause greater fluctuations in our net revenues. 
 We sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees, whereby we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account under-performs relative to its performance target (whether in absolute terms or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such under-performance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve the performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. 
 We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 10.6 , 9.2 and 0.5 of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 6.6 of our AUM). If the percentage of our AUM subject to performance-based fees increases, seasonality and volatility of revenue and earnings are likely to become more significant. Our performance-based fees were 145.2 million, 245.1 million and 132.6 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 The revenues generated by Bernstein Research Services may be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control, including declines in brokerage transaction rates, declines in global market volumes, failure to settle our trades by significant counterparties and the effects of Brexit. 
 Electronic, or low-touch, trading represents a significant percentage of buy-side trading activity and typically produces transaction fees that are significantly lower than traditional full-service fee rates. As a result, blended pricing throughout our industry is lower now than it was historically, and price declines may continue. In addition, fee rates we charge and charged by other brokers for brokerage services have historically experienced price pressure, and we expect these trends to continue. Also, while increases in transaction volume and market share often can offset decreases in rates, this may not continue. 
 In addition, the failure or inability of any of our broker-dealer's significant counterparties to perform could expose us to substantial expenditures and adversely affect our revenues. For example, SCB LLC, as a member of clearing and settlement organizations, would be required to settle open trades of any non-performing counterparty. This exposes us to the mark-to-market adjustment on the trades between trade date and settlement date, which could be significant, especially during periods of severe market volatility. Also, our ability to access liquidity in such situations may be limited by what our funding relationships are able to offer us at such times. 
 Lastly, extensive changes proposed by the SEC to the equity market structure, including Regulation Best Execution, the proposed Order Competition Rule and proposed changes to Regulation NMA establishing, among other things, minimum pricing increments and required disclosures by larger broker-dealers and specified trading platforms, if adopted as proposed, could substantially increase the cost of conducting our buy-side and broker-dealer operations and, possibly, adversely impact trade execution quality. 
 We discuss the risks associated with Brexit below in "Legal and Regulatory-related Risks" in this Item 1A.

 AllianceBernstein 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 We may be unable to develop new products and services, and the development of new products and services may expose us to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk. 
 Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to react nimbly to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client needs, and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with concentrations in industries or sectors specific to individual client criteria, or with a focus on ESG, requires continuous innovative effort on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, and compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements. We can make no assurance that we will be able to develop new products and services that successfully address the needs of clients within needed timeframes. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and expose us to additional costs, which could adversely affect our AUM, revenues and operating income. 
 Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various other currencies can adversely affect our AUM, revenues and results of operations. 
 Although significant portions of our net revenues and expenses, as well as our AUM, presently are denominated in U.S. dollars, we have subsidiaries and clients outside of the United States with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Weakening of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the value in U.S. dollar terms of our revenues and our AUM denominated in these other currencies. Accordingly, fluctuations in U.S. dollar exchange rates affect our AUM, revenues and reported financial results from one period to the next. 
 We may not be successful in our efforts to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations, which could negatively impact our revenues and reported financial results. 
 Our seed capital investments are subject to market risk. While we enter into various futures, forwards, swap and option contracts to economically hedge many of these investments, we also may be exposed to market risk and credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative instruments. 
 We have a seed investment program for the purpose of building track records and assisting with the marketing initiatives pertaining to our firm's new products. These seed capital investments are subject to market risk. Our risk management team oversees a seed hedging program that attempts to minimize this risk, subject to practical and cost considerations. Also, not all seed investments are deemed appropriate to hedge, and in those cases we are exposed to market risk. In addition, we may be subject to basis risk in that we cannot always hedge with precision our market exposure and, as a result, we may be subject to relative spreads between market sectors. As a result, volatility in the capital markets may cause significant changes in our period-to-period financial and operating results. 
 We use various derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and option contracts, in conjunction with our seed hedging program. While in most cases broad market risks are hedged, our hedges are imperfect and some market risk remains. In addition, our use of derivatives results in counterparty risk i.e., the risk that we may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative instruments), regulatory risk e.g. , short selling restrictions) and cash/synthetic basis risk i.e., the risk that the underlying positions do not move identically to the related derivative instruments). 
 We may engage in strategic transactions that could pose risks. 
 As part of our business strategy, we consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions (such as our purchase of CarVal Investors in 2022), dispositions, mergers, consolidations, joint venture partnerships (such as our planned joint venture partnership with SocGen) and similar transactions, some of which may be material. These transactions, if undertaken, may involve various risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:. 
 adverse effects on our earnings if acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; 
 existence of unknown liabilities or contingencies that arise after closing; 
 potential disputes with counterparties; and 
 the possible need for us to increase our firm's leverage or, if we fund the purchase price of a transaction with AB Units or AB Holding Units, likely dilution to our existing unitholders. 
 Acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could under-perform relative to expectations. Additionally, the loss of investment personnel poses the risk that we may lose the AUM we expected to manage, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We may not accurately value the securities we hold on behalf of our clients or our company investments. 
 In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, contractual obligations or client direction, we employ procedures for the pricing and valuation of securities and other positions held in client accounts or for company investments. We have established a Valuation Committee, consisting of senior officers and employees, which oversees pricing controls and valuation processes. If market quotations for a security are not readily available, the Valuation Committee determines a fair value for the security. 
 2022 Annual Report 21 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 Extraordinary volatility in financial markets, significant liquidity constraints or our failure to adequately consider one or more factors when determining the fair value of a security based on information with limited market observability could result in our failing to properly value securities we hold for our clients or investments accounted for on our balance sheet. Improper valuation likely would result in our basing fee calculations on inaccurate AUM figures, our striking incorrect net asset values for company-sponsored mutual funds or hedge funds or, in the case of company investments, our inaccurately calculating and reporting our financial condition and operating results. Although the overall percentage of our AUM that we fair value based on information with limited market observability is not significant, inaccurate fair value determinations can harm our clients, create regulatory issues and damage our reputation. 
 The quantitative and systematic models we use in certain of our investment services may contain errors, resulting in imprecise risk assessments and unintended output. 
 We use quantitative and systematic models in a variety of our investment services, generally in combination with fundamental research. These models are developed by senior quantitative professionals and typically are implemented by IT professionals. Our Model Risk Oversight Committee oversees the model governance framework and associated model review activities, which are then executed by our Model Risk Team. However, due to the complexity and large data dependency of such models, it is possible that errors in the models could exist and our controls could fail to detect such errors. Failure to detect errors could result in client losses and reputational damage. 
 The financial services industry is intensely competitive. 
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including our investment performance for our clients, our array of investment services, innovation, reputation and price. By having a global presence, we often face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain and/or continue to improve our investment performance, our client flows may be adversely affected, which may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. 
 Also, increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. For additional information regarding competitive factors, see Competition in Item 1 . 
 People-related Risks 
 We may be unable to continue to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and the cost to retain key personnel could put pressure on our adjusted operating margin. 
 Our business depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, technical, investment, managerial and executive personnel, and there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. 
 The market for these professionals is extremely competitive. Certain of these professionals often maintain strong, personal relationships with investors in our products and other members of the business community so their departure may cause us to lose client accounts or result in fewer opportunities to win new business, either of which factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Additionally, a decline in revenues may limit our ability to pay our employees at competitive levels, and maintaining (or increasing) compensation without a revenue increase, in order to retain key personnel, may adversely affect our operating margin. For additional information regarding our compensation practices, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in Item 11. 
 Our process of relocating our headquarters may not be executed as we have envisioned. 
 We have established our corporate headquarters in and have relocated a total of approximately 1,250 jobs previously located in the New York metropolitan area to Nashville, Tennessee (for additional information, see Relocation Strategy in Item 7 ). Although the eventual impact on AB from this process is not yet known, the uncertainty created by these circumstances could adversely affect AB s ability to motivate and retain current employees. Further, significant managerial and operational challenges could arise if the firm encounters more difficulty than expected in hiring qualified employees to help staff our Nashville headquarters. 
 Additionally, our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings relating to our headquarters relocation are based on our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. If our assumptions turn out to be inaccurate, our expenses and operating income could be adversely affected. 
 Employee misconduct, which can be difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant regulatory scrutiny, legal liability and reputational harm. 
 There have been several highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry generally, and we are not immune. Misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in legal action, regulatory sanctions, and reputational or financial harm. Further, fraud, payment or solicitation of bribes and other deceptive practices or other misconduct by our employees could similarly subject us to regulatory scrutiny, legal liability and reputational damage.

 Operational, Technology and Cyber-related Risks 
 Technology failures and disruptions, including failures to properly safeguard confidential information, can significantly constrain our operations and result in significant time and expense to remediate, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 We are highly dependent on software and related technologies throughout our business, including both proprietary systems and those provided by third-party vendors. We use our technology to, among other things, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions, store and maintain data, and provide reports and other services to our clients. Despite our protective measures, including measures designed to effectively secure information through system security technology and established and tested business continuity plans, we may still experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, hardware failures, software defects, power outages, acts of war and third-party failures. We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. These adverse effects could include the inability to perform critical business functions or failure to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, which could lead to loss of client confidence, reputational damage, exposure to disciplinary action and liability to our clients. 
 Many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and supported, upgraded and maintained by, third-party vendors. A suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption. Additionally, technology rapidly evolves and we cannot guarantee that our competitors may not implement more advanced technology platforms for their products and services, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Also, we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. Although we take protective measures, our systems still could be vulnerable to cyber attack or other forms of unauthorized access (including computer viruses) that have a security impact, such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently or intentionally causing us to release confidential or proprietary information. Such disclosure could, among other things, allow competitors access to our proprietary business information and require significant time and expense to investigate and remediate the breach. Moreover, loss of confidential client information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. 
 Any significant security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, as well as our failure to properly escalate and respond to such an incident, may significantly harm our operations and reputation. 
 It is critical that we ensure the continuity and effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure, policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them and contracted third-party systems. Although we take protective measures, including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, supply chain attacks, computer viruses or other events that have a security impact, such as an external attack by one or more cyber criminals (including phishing attacks attempting to obtain confidential information and ransomware attacks attempting to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid), which could materially harm our operations and reputation. Additionally, while we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and sensitive information on our other mobile electronic devices, if such devices are stolen, misplaced or left unattended, they may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by us. 
 Furthermore, although we maintain a robust cyber security infrastructure and incident preparedness strategy, which we test frequently, we may be unable to respond, both internally and externally, to a cyber incident in a sufficiently expeditious manner. Any such failure could cause significant harm to our reputation and result in litigation, regulatory scrutiny and/or significant remediation costs.

 Part I 

 Climate change and other unpredictable events, including outbreak of infectious disease, natural disaster, dangerous weather conditions, technology failure, terrorist attack and political unrest, may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. 
 War, terrorist attack, political unrest, power failure, climate change, natural disaster and rapid spread of infectious disease (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) could interrupt our operations by: 
 causing disruptions in global economic conditions, thereby decreasing investor confidence and making investment products generally less attractive; 
 inflicting loss of life; 
 triggering large-scale technology failures or delays; 
 breaching our information and cyber security infrastructure; and 
 requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage and restore operations. 
 Furthermore, climate change may increase the severity and frequency of catastrophes, or adversely affect our investment portfolio or investor sentiment. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of weather-related disasters and pandemics. And, climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities in which we invest, or our willingness to continue to invest in such securities. 
 Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place, including system security measures, information back-up and disaster recovery processes, our ability to conduct business, including in key business centers where we have significant operations, such as Nashville, Tennessee, New York City, London, England, and Hong Kong, may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services we may use or third parties with which we conduct business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to conduct business with and on behalf of our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. Furthermore, unauthorized access to our systems as a result of a security breach, the failure of our systems, or the loss of data could give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation. 
 Our operations require experienced, professional staff. Loss of a substantial number of such persons or an inability to provide properly equipped places for them to work may, by disrupting our operations, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. In addition, our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses, failures or breaches that may occur. 
 Our own operational failures or those of third parties on which we rely, including failures arising out of human error, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and reduce our revenues. 
 Weaknesses or failures in our internal processes or systems could lead to disruption of our operations, liability to clients, exposure to disciplinary action or harm to our reputation. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, large numbers of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions generally must comply with client investment guidelines, as well as stringent legal and regulatory standards. 
 Our obligations to clients require us to exercise skill, care and prudence in performing our services. Despite our employees being highly trained and skilled, the large number of transactions we process makes it highly likely that errors will occasionally occur. If we make a mistake in performing our services that causes financial harm to a client, we have a duty to act promptly to put the client in the position the client would have been in had we not made the error. The occurrence of mistakes, particularly significant ones, can have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and business prospects. 
 The individuals and third-party vendors on whom we rely to perform services for us or our clients may be unable or unwilling to honor their contractual obligations to us. 
 We rely on various counterparties and other third-party vendors to augment our existing investment, operational, financial and technological capabilities, but the use of a third-party vendor does not diminish AB's responsibility to ensure that client and regulatory obligations are met. Default rates, credit downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of market stress. Disruptions in the financial markets and other economic challenges may cause our counterparties and other third-party vendors to experience significant cash flow problems or even render them insolvent, which may expose us to significant costs and impair our ability to conduct business. 
 Weaknesses or failures within a third-party vendor's internal processes or systems, or inadequate business continuity plans, can materially disrupt our business operations. Also, third-party vendors may lack the necessary infrastructure or resources to effectively safeguard our confidential data. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with such third-party relationships, we may suffer fines, disciplinary action and reputational damage.

 We may not always successfully manage actual and potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business. 
 Increasingly, we must manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. Failure to adequately address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and business prospects. 
 We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information. However, appropriately managing conflicts of interest is complex. Our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with actual or perceived conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. 
 Maintaining adequate liquidity for our general business needs depends on certain factors, including operating cash flows and our access to credit on reasonable terms. 
 Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow AUM and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to issue public or private debt on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our profitability, our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates. Furthermore, our access to credit on reasonable terms is partially dependent on our firm s credit ratings. 
 Both Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor's Rating Service affirmed AB s long-term and short-term credit ratings and indicated a stable outlook in 2022. Future changes in our credit ratings are possible and any downgrade to our ratings is likely to increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. If this occurs, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our strategic plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
 An impairment of goodwill may occur. 
 Determining whether an impairment of the goodwill asset exists requires management to exercise a substantial amount of judgment. In addition, to the extent that securities valuations are depressed for prolonged periods of time and/or market conditions deteriorate, or if we experience significant net redemptions, our AUM, revenues, profitability and unit price will be adversely affected. Although the price of an AB Holding Unit is just one factor in the calculation of fair value, if AB Holding Unit price levels decline significantly, reaching the conclusion that fair value exceeds carrying value will, over time, become more difficult. In addition, control premiums, industry earnings multiples and discount rates are impacted by economic conditions. As a result, subsequent impairment tests may occur more frequently and be based on more negative assumptions and future cash flow projections, and may result in an impairment of goodwill. An impairment may result in a material charge to our earnings. For additional information about our impairment testing, see Item 7 . 
 The insurance that we purchase may not fully cover all potential exposures. 
 We maintain professional liability, errors omissions, fidelity, cyber, property, casualty, business interruption and other types of insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the operation of our business. Our coverage is subject to exclusions and limitations, including high self-insured retentions or deductibles and maximum limits and liabilities covered. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, at all. We can make no assurance that a claim or claims will be covered by our insurance policies or, if covered, will not exceed our available insurance coverage, or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. 
 In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. Also, we currently are party to certain joint insurance arrangements with subsidiaries of EQH. If our affiliates choose not to include us as insured parties under any such policies, we may need to obtain stand-alone insurance coverage, which could have coverage terms that are less beneficial to us and/or cost more. 
 Legal and Regulatory-related Risks 
 Our business is subject to pervasive, complex and continuously evolving global regulation, compliance with which involves substantial expenditures of time and money, and violation of which may result in material adverse consequences. 
 Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, rules of securities regulators and exchanges, and laws and regulations in the foreign jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business. If we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability or sanction, including restriction or revocation of our and our subsidiaries professional licenses or registrations, revocation of the licenses of our employees, censures, fines, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. A regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanction, could require substantial expenditures of time and money and could potentially damage our reputation. 
 2022 Annual Report 25

 Part I 

 In recent years, global regulators have substantially increased their oversight of financial services. Some of the newly-adopted and proposed regulations are focused on investment management services. Others, while more broadly focused, nonetheless impact our business. Moreover, the adoption of new laws, regulations or standards and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, regulations or standards have directly affected, and will continue to affect, our business, including making our efforts to comply more expensive and time-consuming. 
 For example, there has been increasing regulatory focus on ESG-related practices by investment managers. The SEC is poised in 2023 to issue a rule enhancing and standardizing climate disclosures by U.S. public companies, including investment managers. The SEC also has focused on the labeling by investment funds of their activities or investments as "sustainable" and has examined the methodology used by funds for determining ESG investments, with a keen focus on whether such labeling may be misleading. Outside the U.S., the European Commission has adopted an action plan on financing sustainable growth, as well as initiatives at the European Union (the " EU ") level, such as the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (the " SFDR "). Compliance with the SFDR and other ESG-related regulations may subject us to increased restrictions, disclosure obligations, and compliance and other associated costs, as well as potential reputational harm. 
 Also, in 2015 the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan (the FSC implemented new limits on the degree to which local investors can own an offshore investment product. While certain exemptions have been available to us, should we not continue to qualify, the FSC s rules could force some of our local resident investors to redeem their investments in our funds sold in Taiwan (and/or prevent further sales of those funds in Taiwan), some of which funds have local ownership levels substantially above the FSC limits. This could lead to significant declines in our investment advisory and services fees and revenues earned from these funds. 
 Additionally, in July 2017 the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, as a benchmark or reference rate for various interest rate calculations, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited announced a plan to extend the date as of which most U.S. LIBOR values would cease being computed from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. Although financial regulators and industry working groups have suggested alternative reference rates, global consensus on alternative rates is lacking and the process for amending existing contracts or instruments to transition away from LIBOR remains unclear. The elimination of LIBOR or changes to other reference rates or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of reference rates may adversely affect the amount of interest payable or interest receivable on certain of our firm's portfolio investments. These changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments. We are finalizing our global assessment of exposure in relation to funds utilizing LIBOR based instruments and benchmarks. Further, we are prioritizing the mitigation of risks associated with the forecast changes to financial instruments and performance benchmarks referencing existing LIBOR rates, and concurrently any impact on AB portfolios and investment strategies. 
 Lastly, it also is uncertain how regulatory trends will further evolve, both in the U.S. and abroad. For example, following the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the U.K.'s departure from the EU resulted in the U.K. leaving the EU Single Market on December 31, 2020. While the U.K. and the EU have agreed to a trade deal, which took effect on January 1, 2021, this deal does not include specific arrangements for financial services. Accordingly, since the start of 2021, our U.K.-based buy-side and sell-side subsidiaries have implemented alternative arrangements in EU jurisdictions (utilizing AB's EU-based subsidiaries) to ensure continued operations in the EU Single Market. These arrangements are subject to potential change due to ongoing negotiations between the U.K. and the EU on future regulatory cooperation, and it is difficult to ascertain how any such changes may impact the ability of our U.K.-based subsidiaries to provide services to EU-based clients in the future. 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings and regulatory matters and may be involved in such proceedings in the future, any one or combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
 We may be involved in various matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which allege significant damages, and we may be involved in additional matters in the future. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages, the litigation is in its early stages, or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. 
 Structure-related Risks 
 The partnership structure of AB Holding and AB limits Unitholders abilities to influence the management and operation of AB s business and is highly likely to prevent a change in control of AB Holding and AB. 
 The General Partner, as general partner of both AB Holding and AB, generally has the exclusive right and full authority and responsibility to manage, conduct, control and operate their respective businesses, except as otherwise expressly stated in their respective Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership. AB Holding and AB Unitholders have more limited voting rights on matters affecting AB than do holders of common stock in a corporation. Both Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership provide that Unitholders do not have any right to vote for directors of the General Partner and that Unitholders only can vote on certain extraordinary matters (including removal of the General Partner under certain extraordinary circumstances). Additionally, the AB Partnership Agreement includes significant restrictions on the transfer of AB Units and provisions that have the practical effect of preventing the removal of the General Partner, which provisions are highly likely to prevent a change in control of AB s management.

 Part I 

 AB Units are illiquid and subject to significant transfer restrictions. 
 There is no public trading market for AB Units and we do not anticipate that a public trading market will develop. The AB Partnership Agreement restricts our ability to participate in a public trading market or anything substantially equivalent to one by providing that any transfer that may cause AB to be classified as a publicly traded partnership PTP as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), shall be deemed void and shall not be recognized by AB. In addition, AB Units are subject to significant restrictions on transfer, such as obtaining the written consent of EQH and the General Partner pursuant to the AB Partnership Agreement. Generally, neither EQH nor the General Partner will permit any transfer that it believes would create a risk that AB would be treated as a corporation for tax purposes. EQH and the General Partner have implemented a transfer program that requires a seller to locate a purchaser and imposes annual volume restrictions on transfers. You may request a copy of the transfer program from our Corporate Secretary (corporate_secretary@alliancebernstein.com) . Also, we have filed the transfer program as Exhibit 10.07 to this Form 10-K. 
 Changes in the treatment of AB Holding and AB as partnerships for tax purposes would have significant tax ramifications. 
 Having elected under Section 7704(g) of the Code to be subject to a 3.5 federal tax on partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, AB Holding is a PTP that is taxable as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. To preserve AB Holding's status as a PTP that is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, AB Holding must not directly or indirectly (through AB) enter into a substantial new line of business. A new line of business includes any business that is not closely related to AB s historical business of providing research and diversified investment management and related services to its clients. A new line of business is substantial when a partnership derives more than 15 of its gross income from, or uses more than 15 (by value) of its total assets in, the new line of business. 
 To preserve AB s status as a private partnership for federal income tax purposes, AB Units must not be considered publicly traded. 
 If either or both AB Holding and AB were taxable as a corporation, the return on investment to Unitholders generally would be reduced because distributions to Unitholders generally would be subject to two layers of taxation: first, amounts available for distribution would be subject to federal (and applicable state and local) taxes at the corporate entity level; and second, Unitholders generally would be subject to federal (and applicable state and local) taxes upon receipt of dividends. 
 AB Holding and AB are subject to the 4.0 New York City unincorporated business tax UBT ). AB Holding may net credits for UBT paid by AB. 
 Changes in tax law governing us or an increase in business activities outside the U.S. could have a material impact on us. 
 Legislative proposals have been or may be introduced that, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot predict the outcome of such legislative proposals. 
 Each of AB's non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries generally is subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdiction where it is located. If our business increasingly operates in countries other than the U.S., or if there are changes in tax law or rates of taxation in foreign jurisdictions where our corporate subsidiaries operate, AB's effective tax rate could increase. 
 If any audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of our income tax returns for any of our taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 results in any adjustments, the IRS may collect any resulting taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest, directly from us, in which case our net income and the cash available for quarterly Unitholder distributions may be substantially reduced. 
 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a "partnership representative" that we designate (a Partnership Representative will have the sole authority to act on our behalf for purposes of, among other things, IRS audits and related proceedings (and any similar state or local audits and proceedings). Any actions taken by us or by the Partnership Representative on our behalf in connection with such audits or proceedings will be binding on us and our Unitholders. 
 For an audit of a partnership's taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the IRS, absent an election by the partnership to the contrary see discussion below ), generally determines adjustments at the partnership level in the year in which the audit is resolved. 
 Generally, we will have the ability to collect any resulting tax liability (and any related interest and penalties) from our Unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will elect to do so or be able to do so under all circumstances. If we do not collect such tax liability from our Unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in the tax year under audit, our net income and the available cash for quarterly distributions to current Unitholders may be substantially reduced. Accordingly, our current Unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such Unitholders did not own Units during the tax year under audit. In particular, with respect to AB Holding, our Partnership Representative may, in certain instances, request that any imputed under-payment resulting from an audit be adjusted by amounts of certain of our passive losses. If we successfully make such a request, we would have to reduce suspended passive loss carryovers in a manner which is binding on the partners. 
 2022 Annual Report 27 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, we may, but are not required to, make an election to require our Unitholders to take into account on their income tax returns an audit adjustment made to our income tax items, also known as a push-out election. This may also require Unitholders to provide certain information to us (possibly including information about the beneficial owners of our Unitholders). Also, a partnership that is a partner of another partnership (such as AB Holding with respect to AB) may elect to have its unitholders take an audit adjustment of the lower-tier partnership into account (i.e., the upper-tier partnership may push adjustments received from the lower-tier partnership through to the partners of the upper-tier partnership). There are several requirements to make a push-out election and we may be unable or unwilling to comply with such requirements. If we do not make a push-out election, we would be required to pay any tax resulting from the adjustments to our income tax items, and the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced. 
 Non-U.S. unitholders may be subject to withholding tax on the sale of their AB Units or AB Holding Units, as well as on distributions, and we may be liable for any under-withholding. 
 Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership unit by a non-U.S. unitholder is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and is subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that the non-U.S. unitholder would have had effectively connected gain or loss on a hypothetical sale by the partnership of all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange of the partnership units. In furtherance of the foregoing, a transferee of a partnership unit is required to withhold a tax equal to 10 of the amount realized on any transfer of such a partnership unit unless an exception applies. 
 Distributions by a PTP to a non-U.S. unitholder also are subject to U.S. withholding tax if the PTP has effectively connected gross income, gain or loss. 
 A transferee is not required to withhold tax if it relies on a certification issued by the transferor or the underlying partnership establishing that an exception to withholding applies. If a transferee of AB Units is required to withhold and failed to properly do so, AB would be required to withhold on distributions to the transferee to satisfy that liability. 
 A broker is not required to withhold on the transfer of an interest in a PTP or on a distribution by a PTP if the PTP certifies that the "10 exception" applies. This exception applies if, either (1) the PTP was not engaged in a U.S. trade or business during a specified time period, or (2) upon a hypothetical sale of the PTP's assets at fair market value, (i) the amount of net gain that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. would be less than 10 of the total net gain, or (ii) no gain would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. 
 To make this certification, the PTP must issue a "qualified notice" indicating that it qualifies for this exception, which we have done and intend to continue to do. The qualified notice must state the amount of a distribution that is attributable to each type of income group specified in the Treasury Regulations. The PTP must post each qualified notice on its primary public website (and keep it accessible for 10 years) and deliver it to any registered holder that is a nominee. A broker may not rely on such a certification if it has actual knowledge that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. 
 As a PTP, beginning on January 1, 2023, AB Holding may be liable for any under-withholding by a broker that relies on a qualified notice for which we failed to make a reasonable estimate of the amounts required for determining the applicability of the 10 exception.

 Our headquarters is located at 501 Commerce Street, Nashville, Tennessee. We occupy 218,976 square feet of space at this location under a 15-year lease agreement that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 We lease space at our other principal location, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York pursuant to a lease expiring in 2024. At this location, we currently lease 999,963 square feet of space, within which we currently occupy approximately 512,284 square feet of space and have sub-let approximately 487,679 square feet of space. 
 Also, we entered into a 20-year lease agreement in New York, New York, at 66 Hudson Boulevard, for 165,608 square feet that is expected to commence in 2024. 
 We also lease 50,792 square feet of space in San Antonio, Texas under a lease expiring in 2029. 
 In addition, we lease more modest amounts of space in 23 other cities in the United States. 
 Our subsidiaries lease space in 30 cities outside the United States, the most significant of which is a lease in London, England, expiring in 2031, and in Hong Kong, China, under a lease expiring in 2024. In London we currently lease 60,732 square feet of space. In Hong Kong, we currently lease and occupy 35,878 square feet of space. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 With respect to all significant litigation matters, we consider the likelihood of a negative outcome. If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. If the likelihood of a negative outcome is reasonably possible and we are able to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts already accrued, if any, we disclose that fact together with the estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. However, it is often difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages. Such is also the case when the litigation is in its early stages or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. In these cases, we disclose that we are unable to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss. 
 On December 14, 2022, four individual participants in the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of AB (the " AB Profit Sharing Plan" filed a class action complaint (the " Complaint ") in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AB, current and former members of the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Investment and Administrative Committees under the AB Profit Sharing Plan. Plaintiffs, who seek to represent a class of all participants in the AB Profit Sharing Plan from December 14, 2016 to the present, allege that defendants violated their fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions under ERISA by including proprietary collective investment trusts as investment options offered in the AB Profit Sharing Plan. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and other equitable relief. AB is prepared to defend itself vigorously against these claims. While the outcome of this matter currently is not determinable given the matter remains in its early stages, we do not believe this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 AB may be involved in various other matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which may allege significant damages. It is reasonably possible that we could incur losses pertaining to these matters, but we cannot currently estimate any such losses. 
 Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently believes that the outcome of any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, any inquiry, proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty; management cannot determine whether further developments relating to any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 AB continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their impact on our employees, business and operations. The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including its impact on the global economy, affects AB s business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future COVID-19 developments that are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of COVID-19 and any recovery period, the emergence, spread and seriousness of COVID-19 variants, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection and hospitalization in various countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other parties in response to COVID-19. Further, we have benefited from certain of our adjusted operating expenses declining significantly due to COVID-19, generally owing to depressed levels of travel and entertainment and in-person client meetings, during both 2020 and 2021. While these costs started to return in 2022, results in 2022 did not reach historical levels; the prior-year savings are not indicative of our future performance. Additionally, as most of our workforce continues working in a hybrid model, which includes the option of two remote days each week, we are mindful of increased risk related to cybersecurity, which could significantly disrupt our business functions. 
 
 Executive Overview (1) 
 Our total assets under management (" AUM ") as of December 31, 2022 were 646.4 billion, down 132.2 billion, or 17.0 , during 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by market depreciation of 140.4 billion and net outflows of 3.6 billion (reflecting Retail net outflows of 11.6 billion, offset by Institutional net inflows of 6.3 billion and Private Wealth Management net inflows of 1.7 billion), offset by the addition of 12.2 billion due to the acquisition of CarVal Investors L.P. (" CarVal ") in the third quarter. AXA S.A.(" AXA ") redeemed approximately 4.5 billion of low-fee fixed income and equity mandates in 2022. Going forward, any AXA-related redemptions or new sales (reflecting, for example, recent commitments by AXA to certain of our private alternative strategies) will be considered as part of our normal course of business. 
 Institutional AUM decreased 39.8 billion, or 11.8 , to 297.3 billion during 2022, primarily due to market depreciation of 57.8 billion, partially offset by the addition of 12.2 billion due to the acquisition of CarVal and net inflows of 6.3 billion. Gross sales increased 0.5 billion, from 31.7 billion in 2021 to 32.2 billion in 2022. Redemptions and terminations decreased 10.1 billion, from 23.4 billion in 2021 to 13.3 billion in 2022. Institutional net inflows included 2.3 billion of AXA redemptions. 
 Retail AUM decreased 77.0 billion, or 24.1 , to 242.9 billion during 2022, primarily due to market depreciation of 65.5 billion and net outflows of 11.6 billion. Net outflows included 2.2 billion of AXA redemptions. Gross sales decreased 34.1 billion, from 100.0 billion in 2021 to 65.9 billion in 2022. Redemptions and terminations increased 1.2 billion, from 65.1 billion in 2021 to 66.3 billion in 2022. 
 Private Wealth Management AUM decreased 15.4 billion, or 12.6 , to 106.2 billion during 2022, due to market depreciation of 17.1 billion, offset by net inflows of 1.7 billion. Gross sales decreased 0.8 billion, from 18.3 billion in 2021 to 17.5 billion in 2022. Redemptions and terminations increased 0.5 billion, from 15.3 billion in 2021 to 15.8 billion in 2022. 
 Bernstein Research Services (" BRS ") revenue decreased 35.7 million, or 7.9 , in 2022. The decrease was driven by significantly lower customer trading activity in Europe and Asia due to local market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AB and Soci t G n rale (EURONEXT: SCGLY, SocGen ), a leading European bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As a result, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 Our 2022 net revenues of 4.1 billion decreased 387.3 million, or 8.7 , compared to net revenues of 4.4 billion in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower base advisory fees of 123.6 million, higher investment losses of 101.8 million, lower performance-based fees of 99.9 million, lower distribution revenues of 45.0 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of 35.7 million and lower shareholder servicing fees of 3.6 million, partially offset by higher net dividend and interest income of 21.6 million. Our operating expenses of 3.2 billion increased 14.1 million, or 0.4 , compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses of 86.0 million, higher amortization of intangible assets of 20.9 million, higher interest on borrowings of 12.8 million and higher contingent payment arrangements of 3.9 million, offset by lower promotion and servicing expenses of 60.1 million and lower employee compensation and benefits expenses of 49.4 million. Our operating income decreased 401.4 million, or 33.0 , to 0.8 billion from 1.2 billion in 2021 and our operating margin decreased to 21.5 in 2022 from 27.3 in 2021.

 Market Environment 
 While equity markets were positive in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the S P 500 Index (" S P ") and Dow Jones Industrial Average both registering gains, both indexes declined for the full year ended December 31, 2022. The S P declined 18.1 for the full year, while the Nasdaq declined by 33.1 and was down 8.7 in December. Inflation remains the dominant issue for U.S. markets, fueling consumer concerns of a potential recession. While the U.S. consumer has been largely resilient so far, higher interest rates have weighed on home building, trade and business investments. Despite signs that the labor market and inflation are easing, the Federal Reserve has maintained its aggressive stance on monetary policy. At its December meeting, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates and indicated that, while future rate increases are likely to be less severe, they continue to be needed. 
 In the U.K., the new prime minister reversed the tax cuts introduced by his predecessor and added some tax increases. These actions calmed the market and reduced the pressure on mortgage rates. However, monetary tightening, steep energy prices and supply-side constraints from Brexit create a challenging outlook for consumers. 
 In China, key watch-points include the property market and overall growth in the economy. The Chinese government has announced new support measures, but it is unclear whether these measures will be sufficient to re-create historical growth patterns. 
 Relationship with EQH and its Subsidiaries 
 EQH (our parent company) and its subsidiaries are our largest client. EQH is collaborating with AB in order to improve the risk-adjusted yield for the General Accounts of EQH's insurance subsidiaries by investing additional assets at AB, including the utilization of AB's higher-fee, longer-duration alternative offerings. Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of EQH (" Equitable Financial "), has agreed to provide 10 billion in permanent capital 2 to build out AB's private illiquid offerings, including private alternatives and private placements. Deployment of this capital commitment is more than 50 completed and is expected to continue over approximately the next two years. We expect this anticipated capital from Equitable Financial will continue to accelerate both organic and inorganic growth in our private alternatives business, allowing us to continue to deliver for our clients, employees, unitholders and other stakeholders. For example, included in this 10 billion commitment by EQH is 750 million in capital to be deployed through AB CarVal. 
 Relocation Strategy 
 As previously announced, we have established our corporate headquarters in Nashville, TN, at 501 Commerce Street. Our Nashville headquarters houses Finance, IT, Operations, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Human Capital, and Sales and Marketing, and at year-end 2022 we had 1,079 employees in Nashville. We expect to reach a total of 1,250 employees in Nashville by the end of 2024. We will continue to maintain a principal location in New York City, which houses our Portfolio Management, Sell-Side Research and Trading, and New York-based Private Wealth Management businesses. 
 We believe relocating our corporate headquarters to Nashville affords us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees and enables us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm. 
 During the transition period, which began in 2018 and is expected to continue through 2024, we currently estimate that we will incur transition costs of between 145 million to 155 million. These costs include employee relocation, severance, recruitment, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Over this same period, we expect to realize total expense savings of between 205 million to 215 million. However, we did incur some transition costs before we began to realize expense savings. For the period beginning in 2018 and ending in the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred 120 million of cumulative transition costs compared to 132 million of cumulative savings. In addition, we incurred 24 million of transition costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 43 million of expense savings, resulting in an overall net savings of 19 million for the period. In 2022, our net income per unit (" EPU ") increased 0.07 as a result of our relocation strategy, which compares to the 0.06 EPU increase that occurred in 2021. We also expect to achieve EPU accretion in each future year. Beginning in 2025, once the transition period has been completed, we estimate ongoing annual expense savings of approximately 75 million to 80 million, which will result from a combination of occupancy and compensation-related savings. Our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings are based on our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. In addition, our estimates for both the timing of when we incur transition costs and realize the related expense savings are based on our current relocation implementation plan and the timing for execution of each phase. The actual total charges we eventually record, the related expense savings we realize, and the timing of EPU impact may differ from our current estimates as we implement each phase of our headquarters relocation. 
 
 2 Permanent capital means investment capital of indefinite duration, which may be withdrawn under certain conditions. Although Equitable Financial has indicated its intention over time to provide this investment capital to AB, which is mutually beneficial to both firms, it has no binding commitment to do so.

 During October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our new Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is 134 million. 
 Although we have presented many of our transition costs and annual expense savings with numerical specificity, and we believe these targets to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these targets may not be achieved. Accordingly, the expenses we actually incur and the savings we actually realize may differ from our targets, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The transition costs and expense savings, together with their underlying assumptions, are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this 2022 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our cost and expense targets. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.

 During 2022, our Retail channel average AUM of 267.8 billion decreased 23.2 billion, or 8.0 , compared to 2021, primarily due to this AUM decreasing 77.0 billion, or 24.1 , to 242.9 billion from December 31, 2021. The 77.0 billion decrease in AUM resulted primarily from market depreciation of 65.5 billion and net outflows of 11.6 billion. During 2021, our Retail channel average AUM of 291.0 billion increased 54.5 billion, or 23.0 , compared to 2020, primarily due to this AUM increasing 54.6 billion, or 20.6 , to 319.9 billion during 2021. The 54.6 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of 33.6 billion and net inflows of 20.8 billion. 
 During 2022, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of 110.3 billion decreased 3.8 billion, or 3.3 , compared to 2021, primarily due to this AUM decreasing 15.4 billion, or 12.6 , to 106.2 billion from December 31, 2021. The 15.4 billion decrease in AUM resulted from market depreciation of 17.1 billion, offset by net inflows of 1.7 billion. During 2021, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of 114.1 billion increased 17.0 billion, or 17.5 , compared to 2020, primarily due to this AUM increasing 16.6 billion, or 15.8 , to 121.6 billion during 2021. The 16.6 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of 13.6 billion and net inflows of 3.0 billion.

 Units Outstanding 
 
 Each quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC, as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. There was no plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2022. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes. 
 Cash Distributions 
 
 We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow. 
 Management Operating Metrics 
 
 We are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. 
 These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (" US GAAP ") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.

 Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased 267.1 million, or 22.0 , from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower performance-based fees of 130.9 million, lower investment advisory base fees of 99.1 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of 35.7 million and higher general and administrative expenses of 32.3 million, partially offset by lower employee compensation and benefits expense of 58.4 million. 
 Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 296.3 million, or 32.3 , from the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of 460.9 million and higher performance-based fees of 91.7 million, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expenses of 221.4 million and higher general and administrative expenses of 49.2 million.

 Adjusted Net Revenues 
 Net Revenue, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution revenues, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory services fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on the distinct arrangements, certain distribution fees are collected by us and passed through to third-party client intermediaries, while for certain other products, we collect investment advisory services fees and a portion is passed through to third-party client intermediaries. In both arrangements, the third-party client intermediary owns the relationship with the client and is responsible for performing services and distributing the product to the client on our behalf. We believe offsetting distribution revenues and certain investment advisory services fees is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties that perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. Distribution-related adjustments fluctuate each period based on the type of investment products sold, as well as the average AUM over the period. Also, we adjust distribution revenues for the amortization of deferred sales commissions as these costs, over time, will offset such revenues. 
 We adjust investment advisory and services fees and other revenues for pass through costs, primarily related to our transfer agent and shareholder servicing fees. Also, we adjust for certain performance-based fees passed through to our investment advisors. These fees do not affect operating income, as such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues. 
 We adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation. 
 Adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. Also, we adjust for certain acquisition-related pass-through performance-based fees and performance related compensation. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2021, we wrote down an equity method investment; this write-down brought the investment balance to zero. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we wrote-down an investment that had been received in exchange for the sale of software technology; the write-down brought the investment balance to zero. Previously, we had been excluding the investment from adjusted net revenues. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 Adjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) real estate charges (credits), (2) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (3) the equity compensation paid by EQH to certain AB executives, as discussed below , (4) the write-down of investments discussed immediately above ), (5) acquisition-related expenses and (6) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. 
 Real estate charges (credits) incurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020, while excluded in the period in which the charges (credits) were recorded, are included ratably over the remaining applicable lease term. 
 Prior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments, which also impacts compensation expense, is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense. 
 The board of directors of EQH granted to Seth Bernstein, our CEO, equity awards in connection with EQH's IPO. Additionally, equity awards were granted to Mr. Bernstein and other AB executives for their membership on the EQH Management Committee. These individuals may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to their service on the Management Committee. Any awards granted to these individuals by EQH are recorded as compensation expense in AB s consolidated statement of income. The compensation expense associated with these awards has been excluded from our non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash and are based upon EQH's, and not AB's, financial performance.

 The write-down of investments discussed above in Adjusted Net Revenues have been excluded due to their non-recurring nature and because they are not part of our core operating results. 
 Acquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. Acquisition-related expenses include professional fees and the recording of changes in estimates to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, acquisition-related expenses also include certain compensation-related expenses, amortization of intangible assets for contracts acquired and accretion expense with respect to contingent payment arrangements. During 2022 and 2021, these expenses included an intangible asset impairment charge of 5.6 million and 1.0 million, respectively, related to various historical acquisitions. 
 The recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded. 
 We adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit 
 As previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments. 
 Adjusted Operating Margin 
 Adjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.

 Net Revenues 
 The components of net revenues are as follows:

 Investment Advisory and Services Fees 
 Investment advisory and services fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares, shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 30 to 105 basis points for actively managed equity services, 10 to 70 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 50 basis points for passively managed services. Average basis points realized for other services could range from 3 basis points for certain Institutional third party managed services to over 150 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients. 
 We calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing

 vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models or any other methodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities. 
 The Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which is overseen by the Valuation Committee and is responsible for managing the pricing process for all investments. 
 We sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 10.6 , 9.2 and 0.5 of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 6.6 of our AUM). 
 Our investment advisory and services fees decreased by 223.5 million, or 7.0 , in 2022, due to a 123.6 million, or 4.2 , decrease in base fees and a 99.9 million decrease in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees is primarily due to a 6.1 decrease in average AUM, partially offset by a slight increase in our portfolio fee rate. Our investment advisory and services fees increased by 599.1 million, or 23.1 , in 2021, due to a 486.6 million, or 19.8 , increase in base fees and a 112.5 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 18.0 increase in average AUM, as well as a slight increase in our portfolio fee rate. 
 Performance-based fees decreased 99.9 million, or 40.7 , in 2022, primarily due to lower performance-based fees earned on Financial Services Opportunities fund, U.S. Select Equity fund, Arya Partners fund and Private Credit Services fund, partially offset by higher U.S. Real Estate Funds fees. Performance-based fees increased 112.5 million, or 84.8 , in 2021, primarily due to higher performance-based fees earned on Private Credit Services, U.S. Real Estate Funds, Financial Services Opportunities and U.S. Select Equity, partially offset by lower Arya Partners fees. 
 Institutional investment advisory and services fees increased 73.2 million, or 12.5 , in 2022, due to an increase in base fees of 41.5 million, or 7.7 , and an increase in performance-based fees of 31.7 million. The increase in base fees is primarily due to a higher portfolio fee rate, partially offset by a 5.3 decrease in average AUM. Institutional investment advisory and services fees increased 74.3 million, or 14.5 , in 2021, due to an increase in base fees of 82.0 million, or 17.9 , partially offset by a decrease in in performance-based fees of 7.8 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 13.9 increase in average AUM, an increase in portfolio fee rate and a shift in product mix from fixed income to active equities and alternatives, which generally earn higher fees. 
 Retail investment advisory and services fees decreased 169.6 million, or 11.4 , in 2022, due to a decrease in base fees of 120.5 million, or 8.4 , and a 49.1 million decrease in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees is primarily due to a 8.0 decrease in average AUM. Retail investment advisory and services fees increased 281.9 million, or 23.3 , in 2021, due to an increase in base fees of 255.6 million, or 21.5 , and a 26.3 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to a 23.0 increase in average AUM. 
 Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees decreased by 127.1 million, or 11.4 , in 2022, due to a decrease in base fees of 44.6 million, or 4.6 , and an 82.5 million decrease in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees is primarily due to a 3.3 decrease in average AUM. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased 243.0 million, or 27.8 , in 2021, due to an increase in base fees of 148.9 million, or 18.2 , and a 94.0 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to a 17.5 increase in average AUM. 
 
 Bernstein Research Services 
 We earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent, but increasingly, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AB and SocGen, a leading European bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As a result, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased 35.7 million, or 7.9 , in 2022. The decrease was driven by significantly lower customer trading activity in Europe and Asia due to local market conditions. 
 2022 Annual Report 47 

Table of Contents 
 Part II 

 Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased 7.7 million, or 1.7 , in 2021. The decrease was due to lower trading activity driven by lower global market volatility as compared to the COVID-related volatility in 2020. This was partially offset by higher research payments across Bernstein and Autonomous Research products. 
 
 Distribution Revenues 
 Two of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as full or partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds. 
 Distribution revenues decreased 45.0 million, or 6.9 , in 2022, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds decreasing 12.4 , partially offset by a shift in product mix from mutual funds with lower distribution rates to mutual funds with higher distribution rates. Distribution revenues increased 122.5 million, or 23.1 , in 2021, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 17.2 . 
 
 Dividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 Dividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers brokerage accounts. 
 Dividend and interest income increased 84.4 million in 2022, primarily due to higher interest earned on customer margin balances, higher interest earned on U.S. Treasury Bills as well as higher dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense increased 62.8 million in 2022, due to higher interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts. 
 Dividend and interest income decreased 12.2 million, or 23.9 , in 2021, primarily due to lower interest earned on U.S. Treasury Bills as well as lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense decreased 12.0 million, or 76.4 , in 2021, due to lower interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.

 Investment Gains (Losses) 
 Investment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iii) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (iv) seed capital investments, (v) derivatives and (vi) investments in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Investment gains (losses) also include equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage.

 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the General Accounts of EQH and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues decreased 2.9 million, or 2.6 , in 2022, primarily due to lower shareholder servicing fees. Other revenues increased 3.7 million, or 3.5 , in 2021, primarily due to higher shareholder servicing fees, partially offset by lower brokerage income.

 Years Ended December 31 Change 2022 2021 2020 2022-21 2021-20 (in thousands) Employee compensation and benefits 1,666,636 1,716,013 1,494,198 (2.9) 14.8 Promotion and servicing: Distribution-related payments 629,572 708,117 569,283 (11.1) 24.4 Amortization of deferred sales commissions 34,762 34,364 27,355 1.2 25.6 Trade execution, marketing, T E and other 215,556 197,486 189,787 9.2 4.1 879,890 939,967 786,425 (6.4) 19.5 General and administrative 641,635 555,608 491,070 15.5 13.1 Contingent payment arrangements 6,563 2,710 1,855 142.2 46.1 Interest on borrowings 17,906 5,145 6,180 n/a (16.7) Amortization of intangible assets 26,564 5,697 21,372 n/a (73.3) Total 3,239,194 3,225,140 2,801,100 0.4 15.1 
 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals). 
 Compensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 41.1 , 38.6 and 40.3 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm s current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, together with the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation Compensation Committee ), continue to believe that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure discussed earlier in this Item 7 ). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 1.1 , 0.9 and 0.9 of adjusted net revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments and the amortization expense associated with the awards issued by EQH to some of our firm's executives relating to their roles as members of the EQH Management Committee. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense, excluding the impact of performance-based fees, generally should not exceed 50 of our adjusted net revenues in any year, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratios of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted net revenues were 48.4 , 46.5 and 47.9 , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 In 2022, employee compensation and benefits expense decreased 49.4 million, or 2.9 , primarily due to lower incentive compensation of 107.7 million, partially offset by higher base compensation of 39.8 million, higher commissions of 12.7 million and higher other employment costs of 5.3 million. In 2021, employee compensation and benefits expense increased 221.8 million, or 14.8 , primarily due to higher incentive compensation of 124.6 million, higher base compensation of 48.9 million, higher commissions of 25.0 million, higher fringes of 20.1 million and higher other employment costs of 3.3 million. 
 
 Promotion and Servicing 
 Promotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to trade execution and clearance, travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials.

 Promotion and servicing expenses decreased 60.1 million, or 6.4 , in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower distribution-related payments of 78.5 million, lower transfer fees of 4.9 million and lower trade execution and clearance expenses of 3.1 million, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment expenses of 15.4 million and higher firm meeting expenses of 8.8 million. Promotion and servicing expenses increased 153.5 million, or 19.5 , in 2021. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of 138.8 million, higher transfer fees of 10.1 million, higher amortization of deferred sales commissions of 7.0 million and higher marketing expenses of 4.9 million, partially offset by lower trade execution and clearance expenses of 7.4 million. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses include portfolio services fees, technology fees, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 15.8 , 12.5 and 13.2 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased 86.0 million, or 15.5 , in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees of 27.3 million, higher portfolio services fees of 21.3 million, higher technology fees of 19.1 million, a valuation adjustment of 7.4 million associated with the classification of BRS as held for sale, higher office-related expenses of 6.9 million and a 5.6 million impairment of certain acquisition related intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased 64.5 million, or 13.1 , in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher portfolio services of 34.0 million, higher technology fees of 14.3 million, higher office-related expenses of 7.6 million, higher professional fees of 6.6 million and an unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact of 5.2 million, partially offset by lower charitable contributions of 4.9 million. 
 
 Contingent Payment Arrangements 
 Contingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in current and previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. In 2022, we recognized 6.6 million in accretion expense related to our contingent considerations payable. The expense of 2.7 million for 2021 reflects accretion expense of 3.3 million, offset by the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of 0.6 million. 
 Interest on Borrowings 
 Interest expense increased 12.8 million in 2022, reflecting higher interest rates on borrowings and higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for the EQH facilities and commercial paper were 845.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.7 during 2022 compared to 561.6 million and 0.2 during 2021. 
 Interest expense decreased 1.0 million, or 16.7 , in 2021, reflecting lower interest rates partially offset by higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were 561.6 million at a weighted average interest rate of 0.2 during 2021 compared to 554.0 million and 0.5 during 2020. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets reflects our amortization of costs assigned to acquired investment management contracts with a finite life. These assets are recognized at fair value and generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. On July 1, 2022, AB acquired CarVal, which resulted in recording of 303.0 million of finite-lived intangible assets primarily relating to investment management contracts and investor relationships with useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ). Amortization of intangible assets increased 20.9 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the acquired intangible assets associated with the CarVal acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 15.7 million, or 73.3 , in 2021. The decrease in the prior year was primarily due to the full amortization of intangible assets related to the Bernstein acquisition. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 AB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes. However, AB is subject to a 4.0 New York City unincorporated business tax UBT ). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located. 
 Income tax expense decreased 23.1 million, or 36.8 , in 2022 compared to 2021. This decrease is due to lower pre-tax book income and one-time discrete items which resulted in a lower effective tax rate in 2022 of 4.9 compared to 5.2 in 2021. 
 Income tax expense decreased 17.1 million, or 37.4 , in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase is due to higher pre-tax book income which resulted in a higher effective tax rate in 2021 of 5.2 compared to 5.0 in 2020.

 Net (Loss) Income of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 
 Net (loss) income of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2022, we had 56.4 million of net loss of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to losses on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2021, we had 5.1 million of net income of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2020 we had 4.2 million of net losses of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to losses on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Cash flows from operating activities primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and services fees and other revenues offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been positive and sufficient to support our operations. We do not anticipate this to change in the foreseeable future. Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of small capital expenditures and, when applicable, business acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of issuance and repayment of debt and the repurchase of AB Holding units to fund our long-term deferred compensation plans. We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow to our Unitholders and the General Partner. 
 During 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.1 billion, compared to 1.3 billion during 2021. The change primarily was due to lower earnings of 265.1 million (after non-cash reconciling items), a decrease in accrued compensation of 200.8 million and a decrease in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of 169.2 million, partially offset by net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of 252.0 million and an increase in fees receivable of 193.3 million. During 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.3 billion, compared to 1.5 billion during 2020. The change primarily was due to net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of 560.6 million, an increase in other assets of 75.7 million and higher net purchases of broker-dealer investments of 33.3 million, partially offset by higher earnings of 346.2 million, an increase in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of 72.9 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 25.2 million. 
 During 2022, net cash used in investing activities was 22.0 million, compared to 65.7 million during 2021. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of CarVal, net cash acquired of 40.3 million in 2022. During 2021, net cash used in investing activities was 65.7 million, compared to 59.1 million during 2020. The change is primarily due to higher purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of 20.4 million, partially offset by lower cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of 9.8 million and lower purchases of equity method investments of 4.1 million. 
 During 2022, net cash used in financing activities was 1.1 billion, compared to 0.9 billion during 2021. The change reflects lower net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2022 of 309.9 million, repayment of CarVal debt subsequent to acquisition of 42.7 million and an decrease in overdrafts payable of 41.6 million, partially offset by higher net borrowings of debt of 155.0 million and a decrease in the net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plans of 51.3 million. During 2021, net cash used in financing activities was 0.9 billion, compared to 1.1 billion during 2020. The change reflects the net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2021 as compared to net redemptions in 2020 (impact of 532.7 million), partially offset by higher distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of 223.0 million as a result of higher earnings (distributions on earnings are paid one quarter in arrears) and an increase in the net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plans of 113.2 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, AB had 1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and cash held for sale), all of which is available for liquidity but consist primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers related to various customer clearing activities and cash held by foreign subsidiaries of 497.0 million.

 Debt and Credit Facilities 
 See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for disclosures relating to our debt and credit facilities. 
 Our financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See Risk Factors in Item 1A and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Item 7 for a discussion of credit markets and our ability to renew our credit facilities at expiration. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 
 Guarantees 
 Under various circumstances, AB guarantees the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 AB maintains a guarantee in connection with an 800 million committed, unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the " Credit Facility "). If SCB LLC is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. SCB LLC currently has five uncommitted lines of credit with five financial institutions. Four of these lines of credit permit us to borrow up to an aggregate of approximately 315.0 million, with AB named as an additional borrower, while the other line has no stated limit. AB has guaranteed the obligations of SCB LLC under these lines of credit. AB maintains guarantees totaling 415.0 million for SCB LLC s five uncommitted lines of credit. 
 AB maintains a guarantee with a commercial bank, under which we guarantee the obligations in the ordinary course of business of each of SCB LLC, our U.K.-based broker-dealer and our Cayman subsidiary. We also maintain three additional guarantees with other commercial banks under which we guarantee approximately 263.4 million of obligations for our U.K.-based broker-dealer and 99.0 million of obligations for our India-based broker-dealer. In the event that any of these three entities is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. 
 We also have two smaller guarantees with a commercial bank totaling approximately 1.9 million, under which we guarantee certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of one of our foreign subsidiaries. 
 We have not been required to perform under any of the above agreements and currently have no liability in connection with these agreements. 
 
 Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 During 2010, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate L.P. Real Estate Fund ), we committed to invest 25.0 million in the Real Estate Fund. As of December 31, 2022, we had funded 22.4 million of this commitment. During 2014, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate II L.P. Real Estate Fund II ), we committed to invest 27.3 million, as amended in 2020, in the Real Estate Fund II. As of December 31, 2022, we had funded 21.6 million of this commitment. 
 We have various compensation and benefit obligations, including accrued salaries and fringes, commissions, payroll taxes, incentive payments and deferred compensation arrangements. The majority of our compensation and benefits obligations are paid out in less than one year, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years. Accrued compensation and benefits as of December 31, 2022 totaled 399.3 million. This amount excludes our accrued pension obligation. Offsetting our accrued compensation obligations are long-term incentive compensation-related investments and money market investments we funded totaling 49.2 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Any amounts reflected on the consolidated statement of financial condition as payables (to broker-dealers, brokerage clients and company-sponsored mutual funds) and accounts payable and accrued expenses are excluded from the aforementioned accrued compensation and benefits obligation amount. 
 We expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately 17.5 million in each of the next four years. We do not currently anticipate that we will contribute to the Retirement Plan during 2023. 
 The 2017 Tax Act (enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017) imposed a federal transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of certain deferred foreign earnings. Management elected to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period from 2018 to 2025. The federal transition tax obligation as of December 31, 2022 totaled 11.7 million and is recorded to income tax payable on our consolidated statement of financial condition. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our taxes. 
 See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion of our leases. 
 See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our debt.

 Contingencies 
 See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
 Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. 
 
 Goodwill 
 Our acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, where the cost of the acquisition is allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, results in the recognition of goodwill. 
 On July 1, 2022, AB Holding acquired a 100 ownership interest in CarVal Investors L.P. CarVal ). Immediately following its acquisition of CarVal (the " CarVal acquisition "), AB Holding contributed 100 of its equity interests in CarVal to AB in exchange for AB Units (s ee Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8) . 
 On November 22, 2022, AB and SocGen, a leading Eu ropean bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As such, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale and 159.8 million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition has been allocated to the held for sale disposal group. As AB is a single reporting unit, we have allocated goodwill to the disposal group based on the relative fair values of (1) the disposal group and (2) the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of 3.6 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition, which included 666.1 million as a result of the CarVal acquisition in the third quarter of 2022, 2.8 billion as a result of the Sanford C. Bernstein Inc. Bernstein acquisition in 2000 and 291.9 million in regard to various smaller acquisitions. Approximately 159.8 million of goodwill has been classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial condition. 
 We have determined that AB has only one reporting segment and reporting unit. We test our goodwill annually, as of September 30, for impairment or if certain events or changes in circumstances occur and trigger an interim impairment test. The carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed if facts and circumstances occur that suggest possible impairment, such as, but not limited to significant transactions including acquisitions or divestitures and significant declines in AUM, revenues, earnings or the price of an AB Holding Unit. Any of these changes in circumstances could suggest the possibility that goodwill is impaired, but none of these events or circumstances by itself would indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Instead, they are merely recognized as triggering events for the consideration of impairment and must be viewed in combination with any mitigating or positive factors. A holistic evaluation of all events since the most recent quantitative impairment test must be done to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit is impaired. 
 For our annual impairment test, we utilize the market approach where the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by AB Holding's Unit price) and earnings multiples. The price of a publicly traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Our market approach analysis also includes comparable industry earnings multiples applied to our earnings forecast and assumes a control premium (when applicable). 
 The announcement of the joint venture between AB and SocGen and classification of the BRS business as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2022 was a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test; as such, we tested our goodwill as of December 31, 2022. The impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. 
 Under ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, a goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Under this guidance, the goodwill impairment test no longer includes a determination by management of whether a decline in fair value is temporary. However, it is important that management's determination of fair value reflect the impact of changing market conditions, including the severity and anticipated duration of any such changes.

 Business Combinations 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are expensed as incurred. 
 Often, as part of the business combination, intangible assets are recorded based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and primarily relate to acquired investment management contracts. We periodically review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, we perform additional impairment tests to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. 
 We periodically enter into contingent payment arrangements in connection with our business combinations. In these arrangements, we agree to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain performance targets are achieved. We estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and record a liability on a discounted basis on our consolidated statement of financial condition. We then accrete the obligation to its expected payment amount over the measurement period. If our expected payment amount subsequently changes, the obligation is modified in the current period resulting in a gain or loss. Both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within contingent payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of income. 
 Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets and contingent liabilities, we typically use a method that is a form of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Similarly for contingent liabilities, we develop a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the performance objectives that are then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows. See Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale 
 The Company classifies assets and liabilities to be sold (disposal group) as held for sale in the period when all of the applicable criteria are met, including: (i) management commits to a plan to sell, (ii) the disposal group is available to sell in its present condition, (iii) there is an active program to locate a buyer, (iv) the disposal group is being actively marketed at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value, (v) significant changes to the plan to sell are unlikely, and (vi) the sale of the disposal group is generally probable of being completed within one year. Management performs an assessment of held for sale at least quarterly or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that a change in classification may be necessary. Assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately within the consolidated statements of financial condition with any adjustments necessary to measure the disposal group at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible and right-of-use assets are not recorded while these assets are classified as held for sale. For each reporting period the disposal group remains classified as held for sale, the carrying value of the disposal group is adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value less costs to sell. A loss is recognized for any subsequent decrease in fair value less costs to sell, while a gain is recognized in any subsequent period for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. If, in any period, the carrying value of the disposal group exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell, a loss is recognized on sale rather than an impairment loss. 
 
 Loss Contingencies 
 Management continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation. We evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists and record a loss contingency if it is both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 .

 Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements provided by management in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Risk Factors in Item 1A . Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in Risk Factors and those listed below could also adversely impact our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
 The forward-looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph , most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding: 
 Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations: AB Holding s cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding s ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB s cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control. 
 Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs: Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm s credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates. 
 The outcome of litigation: Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect any pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect. 
 The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program: The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases. 
 Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense, excluding the impact of performance-based fees, generally should not exceed 50 of our adjusted net revenues on an annual basis: Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels. Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50 of our adjusted net revenues. 
 The adverse impact of COVID-19: The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including its impact on the global economy, affects AB s business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future COVID-19 developments that are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the disease and any recovery period, the emergence, spread and seriousness of COVID-19 variants, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection and hospitalization in various countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other parties in response to COVID-19. 
 The impact of our acquisition of CarVal: These statements concern expected growth, client and stockholder benefits, key assumptions, revenue realization, financial benefits or returns, accretion and integration costs. Actual results may differ materially from future results expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of similar risks to those that impact our other similar business lines, as well as the risk that we are not able to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including the realization of revenue, accretion, and financial benefits or returns, in full or that we may take longer to realize benefits than expected, due, among other reasons, to the challenges of integrating a new business and personnel. The anticipated benefits may also be adversely impacted by the risk that AB Holding units to be issued after the closing are issued at a price below anticipated levels. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. 
 Our Relocation Strategy: While many of the expenses, expense savings and EPU impact we expect will result from our Relocation Strategy are presented with numerical specificity, and we believe these figures to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions on which our estimates are based create a significant risk that our current estimates may not be realized. These assumptions include: 
 the amount and timing of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs we experience; and 
 the timing for execution of each phase of our relocation implementation plan.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the General Partner and Unitholders of AllianceBernstein L.P. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of AllianceBernstein L.P. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in partners capital and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded CarVal Investors L.P. (CarVal) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded CarVal from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. CarVal is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting each approximate 2 of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
 2022 Annual Report 59 

Table of Contents 
 Part II 

 company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Acquisition of CarVal Investors L.P. - Fair Value of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Payable 
 
 As described in Notes 2, 9 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 1, 2022, AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. (AB Holding) acquired a 100 ownership interest in CarVal for total purchase consideration of 818.1 million, which resulted in management recording 303.0 million of finite-lived intangible assets primarily related to investment management contracts and investor relationships with useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years and 228.9 million of contingent consideration payable. Immediately following the acquisition of CarVal by AB Holding, AB Holding contributed 100 of its equity interests in CarVal to AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB) in exchange for AB units. Fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets was based on a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the assets that are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Fair value of the contingent consideration payable was based on a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the performance objectives that are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets and contingent consideration payable recognized in the acquisition of CarVal is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in developing the estimated fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets and the contingent consideration payable. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the future cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rate assumptions utilized within the calculation of the present value of future cash flows. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the determination of the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and contingent consideration payable recognized in the acquisition of CarVal, including controls over the development of the future cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rate assumptions utilized within the calculation of the present value of future cash flows. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and contingent consideration payable. Testing management s process included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the method used to discount future cash flows to present value, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method used to discount future cash flows to present value, and (iii) evaluating management s significant assumptions related to the future cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rate. Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumption related to the future cash flows involved considering the historical performance of Carval, the consistency with external market and industry data, and the consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the method used to discount future cash flows to present value and the reasonableness of the risk-adjusted discount rate assumption.

 Securities borrowed and securities loaned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received in connection with the transaction and are included in receivables from and payables to brokers and dealers in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Securities borrowed transactions require us to deposit cash collateral with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, we receive cash collateral from the borrower. See Note 8 for securities borrowed and loaned amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The initial collateral advanced or received approximates or is greater than the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned. We monitor the fair value of the securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis and request additional collateral or return excess collateral, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there is allowance provision required for the collateral advanced. Income or expense is recognized over the life of the transaction.

 ownership interest in CarVal Investors L.P. CarVal ). Immediately following its acquisition of CarVal (the " CarVal acquisition "), AB Holding contributed of its equity interests in CarVal to AB in exchange for AB Units (see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures ). 
 On November 22, 2022, AB and SocGen, a leading Eu ropean bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As a result, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale and million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition has been allocated to the held for sale disposal group. As AB is a single reporting unit, we have allocated goodwill to the disposal group based on the relative fair values of (1) the disposal group and (2) the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures . 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition which included million as a result of the CarVal acquisition in the third quarter of 2022, billion as a result of the Sanford C. Bernstein Inc. Bernstein acquisition in 2000 and million in regard to various smaller acquisitions. Approximately, million of goodwill has been classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial condition. 
 Goodwill is tested annually, as of September 30, for impairment utilizing the market approach where the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by AB Holding's Unit price) and adjusted market valuations assuming a control premium (when applicable). The price of a publicly traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Throughout the year, the carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances occur and trigger whether an interim impairment test may be required. Such changes in circumstances may include, but are not limited to, significant transactions including acquisitions or divestitures; a sustained decrease in the price of an AB Holding Unit or declines in AB s market capitalization that would suggest that the fair value of the

 We periodically enter into contingent payment arrangements in connection with our business combinations. In these arrangements, we agree to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain performance targets are achieved. We estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and record a liability on a discounted basis on our consolidated statement of financial condition. We then accrete the obligation to its expected payment amount over the measurement period. If our expected payment amount subsequently changes, the obligation is modified in the current period resulting in a gain or loss. Both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within contingent payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of income. The CarVal acquisition resulted in the recording of a contingent consideration payable of million if certain performance targets are achieved over a period (see Note 9 Fair Value and Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures ). During 2022, there were impairments of contingent consideration payable recorded in the consolidated statements of income. During the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we recorded an impairment of the contingent consideration payable of million and million, respectively. These impairments were related to our 2016 acquisition of Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC. 
 Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a method that is a form of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Similarly for contingent liabilities, we develop a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the performance objectives that are then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows. See Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures . 
 to years. 
 The CarVal acquisition resulted in recording of million of finite-lived intangible assets primarily relating to investment management contracts and investor relationships with useful lives ranging from to years (see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures ). 
 As of December 31, 2022, intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of million on the consolidated statement of financial condition consists of million of finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization and million of indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. 
 As of December 31, 2021, intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of million on the consolidated statement of financial condition consisted of million of finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization and million of indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization in regard to other acquisitions.

 million as of December 31, 2022 and million as of December 31, 2021, and accumulated amortization was million as of December 31, 2022 and million as of December 31, 2021. 
 Amortization expense was million for 2022, million for 2021 and million for 2020. Estimated annual amortization expense is approximately million annually in years one through three, million in year four and approximately million in year five. 
 We periodically review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, we perform additional impairment tests to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we performed an impairment assessment and recorded an impairment of million related to our 2014 acquisition of CPH Capital. During the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we recorded impairments of million and million, respectively, related to our 2016 acquisition of Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC. Due to the loss of acquired investment management contracts during each respective year, the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible assets exceeded the fair value of the contracts. We determined the fair value of the contracts using a discounted cash flow model. The impairment charge was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 
 for U.S. fund shares and for Non-U.S. Fund shares, the periods of time during which deferred sales commissions generally are recovered. We recover these commissions from distribution services fees received from those funds and from CDSC received from shareholders of those funds upon the redemption of their shares. CDSC cash recoveries are recorded as reductions of unamortized deferred sales commissions when received. Since January 31, 2009, our U.S. mutual funds have not offered back-end load shares to new investors. 
 There were impairment charges recorded during 2022 or 2021.

 of their awards to deferred cash, not to exceed a total of per award. Each of our employees based outside of the United States (other than expatriates), who received an award of or less, could have allocated of their award to deferred cash. For these awards, the number of AB Holding Units awarded was based on the closing price of an AB Holding Unit on the date as of which the awards were approved by the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee (the " Compensation Committe e") of the Board of Directors (the " Board "). For awards granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 We engaged in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units or purchase newly issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding that are awarded to participants and keep them in a consolidated rabbi trust. 
 Quarterly distributions on vested and unvested AB Holding Units were paid to participants, regardless of whether or not a long-term deferral election has been made. 
 Interest on deferred cash was accrued monthly based on our monthly weighted average cost of funds. 
 We recognize compensation expense related to equity compensation grants in the financial statements using the fair value method. Fair value of restricted AB Holding Unit awards is the closing price of an AB Holding Unit on the grant date; fair value of options is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Under the fair value method, compensatory expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the required service period. For year-end long-term incentive compensation awards, employees who resign or are terminated without cause may retain their awards, subject to compliance with certain agreements and covenants set forth in the applicable award agreement, including the imposition of forfeiture as a result of post-employment competition, prohibitions on employee and client solicitation, and a potential claw-back for failing to follow existing risk management policies. Because there is no service requirement, we fully expense these awards on the grant date. Most equity replacement, sign-on or similar deferred compensation awards included in separate employment agreements or arrangements include a required service period. Regardless of whether the award agreement includes employee service requirements, AB Holding Units typically are delivered to employees ratably over to , unless the employee has made a long-term deferral election.

 . These restricted AB Holding Units are not forfeitable (except if the Eligible Director is terminated for Cause, as that term is defined in the applicable award agreement). We fully expense these awards on grant date, as there is no service requirement. 
 We fund our restricted AB Holding Unit awards either by purchasing AB Holding Units on the open market or purchasing newly- issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, and then keeping these AB Holding Units in a consolidated rabbi trust until delivering them or retiring them. In accordance with the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AB AB ), when AB purchases newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, AB Holding is required to use the proceeds it receives from AB to purchase the equivalent number of newly issued AB Units, thus increasing its percentage ownership interest in AB. AB Holding Units held in the consolidated rabbi trust are corporate assets in the name of the trust and are available to the general creditors of AB.

 (1) Purchased on a trade date basis. The difference between open-market purchases and units retained reflects the retention of AB Holding Units from employees to fulfill statutory tax withholding requirements at the time of delivery of long-term incentive compensation awards. 
 Each quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. There was no plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2022. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes. 
 During 2022, we granted to employees and Eligible Directors million restricted AB Holding Units (including million granted in December for 2022 year-end awards to employees). During 2021, we granted to employees and Eligible Directors million restricted AB Holding Units (including million granted in December for 2021 year-end awards to employees). We used AB Holding Units repurchased during the periods and newly-issued AB Holding Units to fund these awards. 
 During 2022 and 2021, AB Holding issued and million AB Holding Units, respectively, upon exercise of options to buy AB Holding Units. AB Holding used the proceeds of million and million, respectively, received from award recipients as payment in cash for the exercise price to purchase the equivalent number of newly issued AB Units. 
 
 Net foreign currency transaction losses were million, million and million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are reported in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income.

 million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consist of company-sponsored mutual funds and hedge funds. For long-term incentive compensation awards granted before 2009, we typically made investments in company-sponsored mutual funds and hedge funds that were notionally elected by plan participants and maintained them (and continue to maintain them) in a consolidated rabbi trust or separate custodial account. The rabbi trust and custodial account enable us to hold such investments separate from our other assets for the purpose of settling our obligations to participants. The investments held in the rabbi trust and custodial account remain available to the general creditors of AB. 
 The underlying investments of hedge funds in which we invest include long and short positions in equity securities, fixed income securities (including various agency and non-agency asset-based securities), currencies, commodities and derivatives (including various swaps and forward contracts). These investments are valued at quoted market prices or, where quoted market prices are not available, are fair valued based on the pricing policies and procedures of the underlying funds. 
 We allocate seed capital to our investment teams to help develop new products and services for our clients. A portion of our seed capital trading investments are equity and fixed income products, primarily in the form of separately managed account portfolios, U.S. mutual funds, Luxembourg funds, Japanese investment trust management funds or Delaware business trusts. We also may allocate seed capital to investments in private equity funds. Regarding our seed capital investments, the amounts above reflect those funds in which we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE or hold a controlling financial interest in a VOE. See Note 15, Consolidated Company-Sponsored Investment Funds , for a description of the seed capital investments that we consolidated. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our total seed capital investments were million and million, respectively. Seed capital investments in unconsolidated company-sponsored investment funds are valued using published net asset values or non-published net asset values if they are not listed on an active exchange but have net asset values that are comparable to funds with published net asset values and have no redemption restrictions.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the derivative assets and liabilities are included in both receivables and payables to brokers and dealers on our consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains and losses on derivative instruments are reported in investment gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of income. 
 We may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. We minimize our counterparty exposure through a credit review and approval process. In addition, we have executed various collateral arrangements with counterparties to the over-the-counter derivative transactions that require both pledging and accepting collateral in the form of cash. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held million and million, respectively, of cash collateral payable to trade counterparties. This obligation to return cash is reported in payables to brokers and dealers in our consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 Although notional amount is the typical measure of volume in the derivatives market, it is not used as a measure of credit risk. Generally, the current credit exposure of our derivative contracts is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of netting agreements and any collateral received. A derivative with positive value (a derivative asset) indicates existence of credit risk because the counterparty would owe us if the contract were closed. Alternatively, a derivative contract with negative value (a derivative liability) indicates we would owe money to the counterparty if the contract were closed. Generally, if there is more than one derivative transaction with a single counterparty, a master netting arrangement exists with respect to derivative transactions with that counterparty to provide for aggregate net settlement. 
 Certain of our standardized contracts for over-the-counter derivative transactions ISDA Master Agreements contain credit risk related contingent provisions pertaining to each counterparty's credit rating. In some ISDA Master Agreements, if the counterparty s credit rating, or in some agreements, our AUM, falls below a specified threshold, either a default or a termination event permitting the counterparty to terminate the ISDA Master Agreement would be triggered. In all agreements that provide for collateralization, various levels of collateralization of net liability positions are applicable, depending on the credit rating of the counterparty. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we delivered million and million, respectively, of cash collateral into brokerage accounts. We report this cash collateral in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of financial condition.

 We provide below a description of the fair value methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy: 
 Money markets: We invest excess cash in various money market funds that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets; these are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Treasury Bills: We hold U.S. Treasury Bills, which are primarily segregated in a special reserve bank custody account as required by Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act. These securities are valued based on quoted yields in secondary markets and are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Equity securities: Our equity securities consist principally of company-sponsored mutual funds with NAVs and various separately managed portfolios consisting primarily of equity and fixed income mutual funds with quoted prices in active markets, which are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, some securities are valued based on observable inputs from recognized pricing vendors, which are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Derivatives: We hold exchange-traded futures with counterparties that are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, we also hold currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, option swaps and total return swaps with counterparties that are valued based on observable inputs from recognized pricing vendors, which are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Options: We hold exchange-traded options that are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Securities sold not yet purchased: Securities sold not yet purchased, primarily reflecting short positions in equities and exchange-traded options, are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. As of December 31, 2022 these securities have been classified as held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial position. 
 Contingent payment arrangements: Contingent payment arrangements relate to contingent payment liabilities associated with various acquisitions. At each reporting date, we estimate the fair values of the contingent consideration expected to be paid upon probability-weighted AUM and revenue projections, using unobservable market data inputs, which are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 securities.

The liability, ranging from to million, is based on CarVal achieving certain performance objectives over a period ending December 31, 2027. The liability was valued using a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the performance objectives that are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The expected revenue growth rates range from to , with a weighted average of , calculated using cumulative revenues and range of revenue growth rates.

The Credit Facility provides for possible increases in the principal amount by up to an aggregate incremental amount of million; any such increase is subject to the consent of the affected lenders. The Credit Facility is available for AB and Sanford C. Bernstein Co., LLC (" SCB LLC ") business purposes, including the support of AB s commercial paper program. Both AB and SCB LLC can draw directly under the Credit Facility and management may draw on the Credit Facility from time to time. AB has agreed to guarantee the obligations of SCB LLC under the Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, which are customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on dispositions of assets, restrictions on liens, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or lender s commitments may be terminated. Also, under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency- or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Facility would automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lender s commitments automatically would terminate. 
 Amounts under the Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by us from time to time until the maturity of the facility. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions requested by us are permitted at any time without a fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the prepayment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, which will be, at our option, a rate equal to an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of AB, plus one of the following indices: London Interbank Offered Rate; a floating base rate; or the Federal Funds rate.

 We maintain a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plan Retirement Plan covering current and former employees who were employed by AB in the United States prior to October 2, 2000. Benefits are based on years of credited service, average final base salary (as defined in the Retirement Plan) and primary Social Security benefits. Service and compensation after December 31, 2008 are not taken into account in determining participants retirement benefits. 
 Our policy is to satisfy our funding obligation for each year in an amount not less than the minimum required by ERISA and not greater than the maximum amount we can deduct for federal income tax purposes. We did t make a contribution to the Retirement Plan during 2022. We do not currently anticipate that we will contribute to the Retirement Plan during 2023. Contribution estimates, which are subject to change, are based on regulatory requirements, future market conditions and assumptions used for actuarial computations of the Retirement Plan s obligations and assets. Management, at the present time, has not determined the amount, if any, of additional future contributions that may be required.

 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 
 In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of , management considered the historical returns and future expectations for returns for each asset category, as well as the target asset allocation of the portfolio. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the mortality projection assumption used the generational MP-2021 improvement scale, which is consistent with the improvement scale used in 2021. Prior to 2021, mortality was projected generationally using the MP-2020 improvements scale. The base mortality assumption used is the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 base mortality table for private sector plans, with a white-collar adjustment, using the contingent annuitant table for beneficiaries of deceased participants. 
 The Internal Revenue Service IRS recently updated the mortality tables used to determine lump sums. For fiscal year-end 2022, we reflected the most recently published IRS table for lump sums assumed to be paid in 2023. We projected future mortality for lump sums assumed to be paid after 2023 using the current base mortality tables (RP-2014 backed off to 2006) and projection scale of MP-2021.

 Effective as of September 30, 2017, we established the AB 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan 2017 Plan ), which was adopted at a special meeting of AB Holding Unitholders held on September 29, 2017. The following forms of awards may be granted to employees and Eligible Directors (directors who satisfy applicable independence standards) under the 2017 Plan: (i) restricted AB Holding Units or phantom restricted AB Holding Units (a phantom award is a contractual right to receive AB Holding Units at a later date or upon a specified event); (ii) options to buy AB Holding Units; and (iii) other AB Holding Unit-based awards (including, without limitation, AB Holding Unit appreciation rights and performance awards). The purpose of the 2017 Plan is to promote the interest of AB by: (i) attracting and retaining talented officers, employees and directors, (ii) motivating such officers, employees and directors by means of performance-related incentives to achieve longer-range business and operational goals, (iii) enabling such officers, employees and directors to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of AB, and (iv) aligning the interests of such officers, employees and directors with those of AB Holding Unitholders. The 2017 Plan will expire on September 30, 2027, and no awards under the 2017 Plan will be made after that date.

Domestic corporate subsidiaries of AB, which are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with separate state and local income tax returns being filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries are generally subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdictions where they are located. 
 In order to preserve AB s status as a private partnership for federal income tax purposes, AB Units must not be considered publicly traded. The AB Partnership Agreement provides that all transfers of AB Units must be approved by EQH and the General Partner; EQH and the General Partner approve only those transfers permitted pursuant to one or more of the safe harbors contained in the relevant Treasury regulations. If AB Units were considered readily tradable, AB s net income would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax, significantly reducing its quarterly distributions to AB Holding. Furthermore, should AB enter into a substantial new line of business, AB Holding, by virtue of its ownership of AB, would lose its status as a publicly traded partnership and would become subject to corporate income tax, which would reduce materially AB Holding s net income and its quarterly distributions to AB Holding Unitholders.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Each of AB Holding and AB maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (" CEO ") and the Chief Financial Officer (" CFO "), to permit timely decisions regarding our disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for each of AB Holding and AB. 
 Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 On July 1, 2022, AllianceBernstein L.P. completed its acquisition of CarVal Investors L.P. CarVal ). Consistent with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to CarVal. Total assets and total revenues of CarVal that were excluded from management s assessment each constitute approximately 2 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of AB Holding s and AB s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

 Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
 Leadership 
 The Board, together with the Governance Committee, is responsible for reviewing the Board s leadership structure. In determining the appropriate individuals to serve as our Chair and our CEO, the Board and the Governance Committee consider, among other things, the composition of the Board, our company s strong corporate governance practices, and the challenges and opportunities specific to AB. 
 Contacting our Board 
 Interested parties wishing to communicate directly with our Chair or the other members of our Board may send an e-mail, with confidential in the subject line, to our Corporate Secretary or address mail to Ms. Lamm-Tennant in care of our Corporate Secretary. Our Corporate Secretary will promptly forward such e-mail or mail to Ms. Lamm-Tennant. We have posted this information in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 Risk Oversight 
 Board of Directors The Board, together with the Audit Committee, has oversight for our company s risk management framework, which includes investment risk, credit and counterparty risk, and operational risk (includes legal/regulatory risk, cyber security risk and climate risk), and is responsible for helping to ensure that these risks are managed in a sound manner. 
 
 q Audit Committee The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, the responsibility to consider our company s policies and practices with respect to investment, credit and counterparty, and operational risk assessment and risk management, including discussing with management the major financial, operational and reputational risk exposures and the steps taken to monitor and control such exposures. 
 
 p Risk Management Team Chief Risk Officer Members of the company's risk management team (including our Chief Security Officer), who are responsible for identifying, managing and controlling the array of risks inherent in our company s business and operations, make quarterly reports to the Audit Committee, which address investment, credit and counterparty, and operational risk identification, assessment and monitoring. 
 u The Chief Risk Officer makes quarterly presentations to the Audit Committee and has reporting lines to the CEO and the Audit Committee. 
 
 The Board has determined that its leadership and risk oversight are appropriate for our company. Mr. Bernstein s in-depth knowledge of financial services and extensive executive experience in the investment management industry make him well-suited to serve as our President and CEO, while Ms. Lamm-Tennant s in-depth industry and academic experience are invaluable at enhancing the overall functioning of the Board. The Board believes that the combination of a separate Chair and CEO, the Audit Committee, a specialized risk management team and significant involvement from our largest Unitholder (EQH) provide the appropriate leadership to help ensure effective risk oversight. 
 Code of Ethics and Related Policies 
 Our directors, officers and employees are subject to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the " Code of Ethics "). The Code of Ethics is intended to comply with Section 303A.10 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, as well as with recommendations issued by the Investment Company Institute regarding, among other things, practices and standards with respect to securities transactions of investment professionals. The Code of Ethics establishes certain guiding principles for all of our employees, including sensitivity to our fiduciary obligations and ensuring that we meet those obligations. In addition, the Code of Ethics, together with our firm's insider trading policy, restricts employees from trading when in possession of material non-public information of any kind, which can include the existence of a significant cybersecurity incident at our firm. Our Code of Ethics may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site.

 We have adopted a Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, which is intended to comply with Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Item 406 Code ). The Item 406 Code may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding certain amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of the Item 406 Code that apply to the CEO, the CFO and the Chief Accounting Officer by posting such information on our Internet Site. To date, there have been no such amendments or waivers. 
 NYSE Governance Matters 
 Section 303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual exempts limited partnerships from compliance with the following sections of the Manual, some of which we comply with voluntarily: Section 303A.01 (board must have a majority of independent directors), 303A.04 (corporate governance committee must have only independent directors as its members and must have a charter that addresses, among other things, the committee s purpose and responsibilities), and 303A.05 (compensation committee must have only independent directors as its members and must have a charter that addresses, among other things, the committee s purpose and responsibilities). 
 AB Holding is a limited partnership (as is AB). In addition, because the General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQH, and the General Partner controls AB Holding (and AB), we believe we also would qualify for the controlled company exemption. However, we comply voluntarily with the charter requirements set forth in Sections 303A.04 and 303A.05. 
 Our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the Guidelines promote the effective functioning of the Board and its committees, promote the interests of the Partnerships respective Unitholders (with appropriate regard to the Board s duties to the sole stockholder of the General Partner), and set forth a common set of expectations as to how the Board, its various committees, individual directors and management should perform their functions. The Guidelines may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 The Governance Committee is responsible for considering any request for a waiver under the Code of Ethics, the Item 406 Code and the EQH Policy Statement on Ethics from any director or executive officer of the General Partner. No such waiver has been granted to date and, if a waiver is granted in the future, such waiver would be described in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 We include in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance, section of our Internet site an e-mail address for any interested party, including Unitholders, to communicate with the Board. Our Corporate Secretary reviews e-mails sent to that address and has some discretion in determining how or whether to respond, and in determining to whom such e-mails should be forwarded. In our experience, substantially all of the e-mails received are ordinary client requests for administrative assistance that are best addressed by management, or solicitations of various kinds. 
 Certifications by our CEO and CFO pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have been furnished as exhibits to this Form 10-K. 
 AB Holding Unitholders and AB Unitholders may request a copy of any committee charter, the Guidelines, the Code of Ethics, and the Item 406 Code by contacting our Corporate Secretary. The charters and memberships of the Executive, Audit, Governance and Compensation Committees may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 Fiduciary Culture 
 We maintain a robust fiduciary culture and, as a fiduciary, we place the interests of our clients first and foremost. We are committed to the fair and equitable treatment of all our clients, and to compliance with all applicable rules and regulations and internal policies to which our business is subject. We pursue these goals through education of our employees to promote awareness of our fiduciary obligations, incentives that align employees interests with those of our clients, and a range of measures, including active monitoring, to ensure regulatory compliance. Our compliance framework includes: 
 the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee (the Ethics Committee and the Internal Compliance Controls Committee (the Compliance Committee ), each of which consists of our executive officers and other senior executives; 
 an ombudsman office, where employees and others can voice concerns on a confidential basis; 
 firm-wide compliance and ethics training programs; and 
 a Conflicts Officer and a Conflicts Committee, which help to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest. 
 The Ethics Committee oversees all matters relating to issues arising under our Code of Ethics and meets on a quarterly basis and at such other times as circumstances warrant. The Ethics Committee and its subcommittee, the Personal Trading Subcommittee, have oversight of personal trading by our employees. 
 The Compliance Committee reviews compliance issues throughout our firm, endeavors to develop solutions to those issues as they may arise from time to time and oversees implementation of those solutions. The Compliance Committee meets on a quarterly basis and at such other times as circumstances warrant.

 Compensation Philosophy and Goals 
 The intellectual capital of our employees is collectively the most important asset of our firm.

 Deliver superior investment solutions to our clients; 
 Develop high-quality differentiated services; and 
 Maintain strong incremental margins. 
 We also are focused on ensuring that our compensation practices are competitive with industry peers and provide sufficient potential for wealth creation for our NEOs and our employees generally, which we believe will enable us to meet the following key compensation goals: 
 attract, motivate and retain highly-qualified executive talent; 
 reward prior-year performance; 
 incentivize future performance; 
 recognize and support outstanding individual performance and behaviors that demonstrate and foster our firm s primary objective of helping our clients reach their financial goals; and 
 align our executives long-term interests with those of our Unitholders and clients.

 Progress in Advancing our Growth Strategy in 2022 
 Despite a challenging investing and operating environment in 2022, we continued to make progress in executing our Growth Strategy: Deliver, Diversify, and Expand, Responsibly, with Equitable. 
 Deliver Superior Investment Solutions to our Clients: 
 Investment Performance 
 The firm s investment teams continue to focus on consistently delivering differentiated return streams to our clients. We believe that, over time, the ability to produce idiosyncratic returns that cannot be easily replicated will be central to sustaining our competitive advantage. In 2022, our fixed income performance lagged, with 20 of assets outperforming for the one-year period ended December 31, 2022, while the majority, or 53 , outperformed over the three-year period and 70 outperformed for the five-year period. In active equities, 59 of assets were in outperforming services for the one-year period, 59 for the three-year period and 77 for the five-year period ended December 31, 2022. (This performance data reflects the percentage of active fixed income and equity assets in institutional services that outperformed their respective benchmarks, gross of fees, and of active fixed income and equity assets in retail advisor and I share class funds ranked in the top half of their Morningstar category; if no advisor class exists, we used A share class). Additionally, at year-end 2022, 62 of U.S. Fund assets and 38 of Non-U.S. Fund assets were rated 4- or 5-stars by Morningstar. 
 The following retail fixed income and equity mutual funds with AUM greater than 1 billion placed in the top quartile of performance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022: 
 AB U.S. retail fixed income mutual funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Bond Inflation Strategy 
 AB Municipal Bond Inflation Strategy 
 AB Non U.S. fixed income funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Short Duration High Yield 
 AB U.S. retail equity mutual funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Sustainable Global Thematic 
 AB Non U.S. equity funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Select US Equity 
 AB International Healthcare 
 AB American Growth 
 AB Sustainable Global Thematic 
 AB Sustainable US Thematic 
 
 Net Flows 
 Scaling our proven investment services remains a key focus of our firm. Despite negative returns for both equity and fixed income markets in 2022, which drove industry-wide active net outflows, we generated our fourth consecutive year of positive active organic growth, or 0.9 billion, primarily due to 22 organic growth in alternatives/multi-asset. In our Retail channel, gross sales were 65.9 billion, down 34 compared with a record 2021. The retail redemption rate declined to 24 in 2022 from 30 in 2021, and full-year net outflows were 11.6 billion, driven by taxable fixed income. In our Institutional channel, gross sales were 32.2 billion, the highest since 2008, driven by 16 billion in funding related to two institutional custom target date mandates. The firm generated institutional net inflows of 6.3 billion, or a 2 organic growth rate, for a fourth consecutive year of organic growth. Our pipeline of 13.2 billion in AUM decreased by 39 as compared with 21.5 billion a year ago, reflecting strong fourth quarter funding; alternatives represented over 80 of the pipeline fee base at year-end. In Private Wealth, gross sales in 2022 of 17.5 billion were strong, decreasing just 4 year-over-year, and this channel generated its fifth year of net inflows in the last seven, or 1.4 organic growth.

 Diversify Through D eveloping High-Quality Differentiated Services: 
 Growing the diversity of our offerings to meet the needs of an evolving, complex global client base remains a key focus. In 2022, new investment strategy launches across our global platform included: Diversity Champions Equity, SMA Custom Muni, AB Ultra Short Income ETF, AB Tax-Aware Short Duration Municipal ETF and Fixed Maturity Portfolio 2025. Additionally, we launched multiple new vehicles for existing investment strategies in response to customer demand, across a diverse set of geographies. 
 Expand: 
 In 2022, we focused on expanding our Private Alternatives business, both organically (by scaling existing investment platforms) and inorganically. The acquisition of CarVal Investors, which closed on July 1, 2022, added complementary services including: opportunistic/distressed credit, renewable energy, infrastructure, specialty finance and transportation. AB s Private Markets platform is now 56 billion, up 57 year over year, reflecting a diverse and relevant offering for institutional, retail and private wealth clients. We remain focused on expanding opportunistically, both inside and outside the U.S., to support long-term growth. We have efforts underway to expand our range of services and capabilities in China, other Asian nations and select European markets. We are also investing in our Insurance asset management business to grow third party clients. And, we have redesigned the Muni investment platform to enable customization and tax optimization at scale in our custom Muni SMAs. 
 Responsibly: 
 We continue to launch new Portfolios with Purpose, which now represent 24 billion in AUM; while down from 32 billion the prior year due to lower market levels, these portfolios continued to grow organically. In 2022, we were recognized as a thought leader, winning numerous awards, including: Best Sustainable Fund Management Group of the Year (Investment Week), and Environmental Finance s IMPACT Award for Fixed Income Fund of the Year (Muni Impact). 
 With Equitable: 
 Equitable has allocated and is currently deploying 10 billion of permanent capital 3 to AB s illiquid platform to reposition and thereby further improve the risk adjusted return of its General Account, through seeding new alternative business at AB. Included in this 10 billion commitment is 750 million to be deployed in AB CarVal strategies. 
 In addition to funding record inflows to our US and Europe Commercial Real Estate Debt strategies in 2022, Equitable supported the launch of our Ultra Short Income ETF. 
 As of year-end 2022, more than 50 of the 10 billion of committed capital has been deployed in both Private Alternative and Private Placement strategies. 
 Maintain Strong Incremental Margins: 
 We remain focused on managing costs to help ensure that we generate targeted incremental adjusted operating margins in the range of 45-50 , over time. In 2022, we continued to execute a key pillar of this strategy, which we initially announced in 2018: the relocation of our corporate headquarters from New York City to Nashville. In 2022, we continued to relocate positions to our recently constructed Nashville headquarters. We have relocated over 85 of our targeted 1,250 positions. We continue to seek efficiencies and manage various operating expenses to help ensure that we drive operating leverage on incremental revenues. 
 Declines in equity and fixed income markets in 2022 negatively impacted our revenues, resulting in a rolling three-year incremental adjusted operating margin of 35 , below our targeted range of 45 to 50 . Our adjusted operating margin decreased to 28.4 in 2022, down 520 basis points as compared to 33.6 in 2021. The decrease resulted from an 8 decline in adjusted net revenues, driven by lower base fees, lower performance-based fees, and a decline in Bernstein Research Services revenues. Total adjusted compensation and benefits expense declined by 3 and total adjusted operating expenses were flat year over year. We provide additional information regarding our adjusted compensation ratio below in this CD see our discussion of Management Operating Metrics above in Item 7 for a reconciliation between our results pursuant to US GAAP and our adjusted results. 
 
 3 Permanent capital means investment capital of indefinite duration, which may be withdrawn under certain conditions. Although Equitable Financial has indicated its intention over time to provide this investment capital to AB, which is mutually beneficial to both firms, it has no binding commitment to do so.

 Overview of 2022 Incentive Compensation Program 
 When reflecting on 2022 performance and pay, each of our NEOs (other than Mr. Dibadj, who resigned in March 2022) received a portion of his or her year-end incentive compensation in the form of an annual cash bonus and a portion in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards. The split between annual cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation varied depending on the NEO's total compensation, with lower-paid executives receiving a greater percentage of their incentive compensation as cash bonuses than more highly-paid executives. (For additional information about these compensatory elements, see Compensation Elements for NEOs below .) 
 In 2022, we utilized performance scorecards for senior leaders of the firm, including our NEOs. These scorecards require our senior leaders to develop and maintain a broad leadership mindset with priorities, such as accelerating ESG initiatives and our firm's alternatives platform, that are aligned with firm-wide goals of creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders. The scorecard for each NEO reflected our Growth Strategy and included actual results relative to target metrics across the following measures: 
 Financial performance, including peer results, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net revenue growth and operating efficiency targets see our discussion of Management Operating Metrics in Item 7 for a reconciliation between our results pursuant to US GAAP and our adjusted results); 
 Investment performance, by delivering competitive returns across services and time periods; 
 Strategic, aligned with our strategy of delivering core investment solutions, while developing high-quality differentiated services, in faster-growing geographies, responsibly, in partnership with Equitable; 
 Organizational, including organizational effectiveness and efficiency, leadership impact, succession planning, developing talent, innovating and automating, and real estate utilization; and 
 Cultural, including purpose, employee engagement, diversity, retention and safety. 
 The scorecards support management and the Compensation Committee in assessing each executive's performance relative to business, operational and cultural goals established at the beginning of the year and reviewed in the context of the current-year financial performance of the firm. The amount of incentive compensation paid to our NEOs continues to be determined on a discretionary basis by the Compensation Committee. (For additional information, please see "Compensation Committee; Process for Determining Executive Compensation" below in this CD A .) 
 Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Burke, together with the Compensation Committee, continue to believe that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation paid to all employees, including our NEOs, in respect of 2022 performance is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues, which terms are described immediately below : 
 Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is our total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals, and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. Also, we adjust for certain performance-based fees passed through to our investment professionals. 
 Adjusted net revenues (see our discussion of Management Operating Metrics in Item 7 for a reconciliation between our results pursuant to US GAAP and our adjusted results) exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. In addition, adjusted net revenues offset distribution-related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues. We also exclude additional pass-through expenses we incur (primarily through our transfer agent) that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues. Additionally, we adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds revenues and including AB s fees from such funds, and AB s investment gains and losses on its investment in such funds, that were eliminated in consolidation. We also adjust for certain acquisition-related pass-through performance-based fees and certain other performance-based fees passed through to our investment professionals. 
 2022 Annual Report 131 

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 In addition, Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Burke, together with the Compensation Committee, continue to believe that the firm s adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense, excluding the impact of performance-based fees, generally should not exceed 50.0 of our adjusted net revenues annually, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. As the table below indicates , in 2022, adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense amounted to approximately 48.4 of our adjusted net revenues (in thousands): 
 Net Revenues 4,054,290 Adjustments see above 
 (718,056) Adjusted Net Revenues 3,336,234 Employee Compensation Benefits Expense 1,666,636 Adjustments see above 
 (53,354) Adjusted Employee Compensation Benefits Expense 1,613,282 Adjusted Compensation Ratio 48.4 
 Our 2022 adjusted compensation ratio of approximately 48.4 reflects a balancing of the need to keep compensation levels competitive with industry peers in order to attract, motivate and retain highly-qualified talent with the need to maintain strong operating leverage in our business. The Compensation Committee works with management to help ensure both needs are sufficiently addressed.

 Summary of Achievements: As President and CEO, Mr. Bernstein led AB to achieve modestly positive active organic growth despite a very challenging year. Disciplined expense management allowed the firm to continue to invest in strategic growth areas, including the acquisition of CarVal Investors (" CarVal ") and the expansion of services for key client segments. Mr. Bernstein drove a focus on leadership development, organizational stability, and culture as we successfully returned to the office globally adopting a new hybrid working model. 
 Individual Achievements 
 Financial and Investment Performance

 Adjusted Earnings per Unit EPU of 2.95 in 2022 declined 24 compared to 2021, reflecting adverse financial markets. 
 The majority of equity assets outperformed peers or benchmarks in equities despite the challenging market environment, while fixed income underperformed (as measured by the percentage of assets outperforming). Longer term, five-year returns for both asset classes remain competitive. 
 Strategic 
 Successfully closed the acquisition of CarVal, a global alternatives manager with complementary capabilities, expanding AB s private markets platform to 56B in assets under management. 
 Announced plans to form a joint venture partnership with Soci t G n rale (" SG ") for our Bernstein Research Services business, identifying a strategic partner committed to strengthening and growing the cash equities and research business, while allowing AB to continue to invest in key strategic priorities.

2022 Compensation 

Ali Dibadj 
 Former CFO and Head of Strategy 
 Mr. Dibadj served as CFO and Head of Strategy until March 2022 when he notified AB of his resignation from his position to become the chief executive officer of another publicly traded company. Up until his resignation, Mr. Dibadj was responsible for AB's financial functions, including accounting, tax, treasury, financial planning analysis, investor relations and corporate strategy. Mr. Dibadj's only compensation in 2022 consisted of a pro-rata portion of his 400,000 salary (through his termination date) and equity awards he received from EQH (which he forfeited when he resigned). 
 2022 Compensation 

The compensation of each of these NEOs (other than Mr. Dibadj) reflected the Compensation Committee s judgment (and Mr. Bernstein s judgment, with respect to each executive other than himself) in assessing the importance of the executive's achievements in the context of our firm s adjusted financial results and progress in advancing our Growth Strategy.

 Compensation Committee; Process for Determining Executive Compensation 
 The Compensation Committee consists of Ms. Matus (Chair), Mr. Kaye and Mr. Pearson. The Compensation Committee held five regular meetings and one special meeting in 2022. 
 As discussed in NYSE Governance Matters in Item 10 , AB Holding, as a limited partnership, is exempt from NYSE rules that require public companies to have a compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors. EQH owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an approximate 61.3 economic interest in AB (as of December 31, 2022), and compensation expense is a significant component of our financial results. For these reasons, Mr. Pearson, director and President and CEO of EQH, is a member of the Compensation Committee, and any action taken by the Compensation Committee requires his affirmative vote or consent. Given this structure, the Compensation Committee has established a sub-committee consisting entirely of non-management directors (i.e., Ms. Matus and Mr. Kaye). This Section 16 Sub-Committee approves awards of restricted AB Holding Units to NEOs to ensure we can utilize the short-swing trading exemption set forth in Section 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this exemption, equity grants to our firm's executive officers are exempt from short-swing trading rules if each such grant is approved by the full Board or a committee of the Board consisting entirely of non-employee directors (generally, directors who are not officers of the company or an affiliate). 
 The Compensation Committee has general oversight of compensation and compensation-related matters, including: 
 determining cash bonuses; 
 determining contributions and awards under incentive plans or other compensation arrangements (whether qualified or non-qualified) for employees of AB and its subsidiaries, and amending or terminating such plans or arrangements or any welfare benefit plan or arrangement or making recommendations to the Board with respect to adopting any new incentive compensation plan, including equity-based plans; 
 reviewing and approving the compensation of our CEO, evaluating his performance, and determining and approving his compensation level based on this evaluation; and 
 reviewing and discussing the CD A and recommending to the Board its inclusion in each of AB s and AB Holding s Form 10-K and, when applicable, proxy statements. 
 The Compensation Committee has developed a comprehensive process for: 
 reviewing our executive compensation program to ensure it is aligned with our firm s philosophy and strategic objectives; 
 evaluating performance by our NEOs against goals and objectives established in each executive's performance scorecard at the beginning of the year; and 
 setting compensation for the NEOs and other senior executives. 
 The Compensation Committee s year-end process generally focuses on the cash bonuses and long-term incentive compensation awards granted to NEOs and other senior executives. Mr. Bernstein, working with Ms. Burke and other senior executives, provides recommendations for individual executive awards to the Compensation Committee for its consideration. As part of this process, and as we discuss more fully below in " Compensation Consultant; Benchmarking Data ," Ms. Burke provides the Committee with competitive market data from one or more compensation consultants. 
 Management periodically reviews with the Compensation Committee the firm s expected adjusted financial and operating results, the firm s actual results and management s year-end compensation expectations, as they evolve throughout the year. Management accomplished these reviews during regular meetings of the Compensation Committee held in February, May, September, October and November 2022, as well as one special meeting held in July 2022. The Compensation Committee approved the firm's final year-end compensation recommendations during its regular meeting held in November 2022. 
 Additional information regarding the Compensation Committee s functions can be found in the Committee's charter, which is available online in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site.

 Compensation Consultant; Benchmarking Data 
 In 2022, we retained McLagan Partners McLagan as an independent consultant to provide competitive market data and trend forecasting for our NEOs and other senior executives, for which we paid McLagan 53,500 (the " 2022 Benchmarking Data "). McLagan has an extensive database on compensation for most investment management companies, including private companies for which information is not otherwise available. 
 The 2022 Benchmarking Data summarized 2021 compensation levels and 2022 salaries, which helps form a reasonable estimation of compensation levels in the industry for executive positions like those held by our NEOs at selected asset management companies comparable to ours in terms of size and business mix (the Comparable Companies and, in so doing, assists in determining the appropriate level of compensation for our NEOs. 
 The Comparable Companies, which management selected with input from McLagan, included: 
 Barings Columbia Threadneedle Franklin Tempelton Investments Goldman Sachs Asset Management Invesco Janus Henderson Investors Loomis, Sayles Company MFS Investment Management Morgan Stanley Investment Management Neuberger Berman Group Nuveen Investments Pacific Investment Management Prudential Global Investment Mgmt. Schroder Investment Management T. Rowe Price 
 The 2022 Benchmarking Data indicated that, as a group, our NEOs fall within market range. Please note that we excluded Mr. Dibadj from this analysis as he left AB in March 2022 and, accordingly, did not receive year-end incentive compensation. 
 The Compensation Committee considered this information in concluding that the compensation levels paid in 2022 to our NEOs (other than Mr. Dibadj, who was not considered in this process) were appropriate and reasonable. 
 Compensation Elements for NEOs 
 We utilize a variety of compensation elements to achieve the goals described above , consisting of base salary, annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), a long-term incentive compensation award program, a defined contribution plan, a defined benefit plan and certain other benefits, each of which we discuss below : 
 Base Salaries 
 Base salaries comprise a relatively small portion of our NEOs total compensation. We consider individual experience, responsibilities and tenure with the firm when determining the narrow range of base salaries paid to our NEOs please refer to Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement below for information relating to Mr. Bernstein s base salary and other compensation elements). 
 Annual Short-Term Incentive Compensation Awards (Cash Bonuses) 
 We provide our NEOs with annual short-term incentive compensation awards in the form of cash bonuses. 
 We believe that annual cash bonuses, which generally reflect individual performance and the firm s current year financial performance, provide a short-term retention mechanism for our NEOs because such bonuses typically are paid during the last week of the year. 
 Annual cash bonuses in respect of 2022 performance for each NEO were determined in November 2022 and paid in December 2022. These bonuses, and the 2022 long-term incentive compensation awards described immediately below , were based on management s evaluation, subject to the Compensation Committee s review and approval, of each NEO s performance during the year, the firm's progress in advancing its Growth Strategy during the year, the performance of the NEO s business unit or function compared to business and operational goals established in each NEO's performance scorecard at the beginning of the year, and the firm s current-year financial performance. 
 In respect of 2022, Mr. Bernstein received a cash bonus of 4,925,000 in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement into which he entered with the General Partner, AB and AB Holding as of May 1, 2017 (the CEO Employment Agreement and after review of Mr. Bernstein's performance during 2022 by the Compensation Committee. Please refer to Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement below for additional information relating to Mr. Bernstein s cash bonus and other compensation elements.

 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards 
 Long-term incentive compensation awards generally are denominated in restricted AB Holding Units. We utilize this structure to align our NEOs long-term interests directly with the interests of our Unitholders and indirectly with the interests of our clients, as strong performance for our clients generally contributes directly to increases in AUM and improved financial performance for the firm. 
 We believe that annual long-term incentive compensation awards provide a long-term retention mechanism for our NEOs because such awards generally vest ratably over time; awards granted in 2022 generally vest in equal portions over three years, while awards granted prior to 2021 generally vest over four years. We reduced the vesting period to three years for awards in 2021 to help ensure our compensation framework remains highly competitive. 
 For 2022 performance, awards were granted in December 2022 to each of Ms. Burke and Messrs. Bernstein, Erzan, Sprules, Manley and Siemers pursuant to the AB 2022 Incentive Compensation Award Program (the " ICAP "), an unfunded, non-qualified incentive compensation plan, and the AB 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan, our equity compensation plan (the 2017 Plan ). Mr. Dibadj, who resigned in March 2022, did not receive an award. 
 Prior to the date on which an award vests, the AB Holding Units underlying an award are restricted and are not permitted to be transferred. Upon vesting, the AB Holding Units underlying an award generally are delivered, unless the award recipient has, in advance, voluntarily elected to defer receipt to future periods or the award is structured with a delayed delivery date. Quarterly cash distributions on vested and unvested restricted AB Holding Units are delivered to award recipients when cash distributions are paid generally to Unitholders. 
 An award recipient who resigns or is terminated without cause prior to the vesting date is eligible to continue to vest in his or her long-term incentive compensation award subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in the applicable award agreement, including restrictions on competition, and restrictions on employee and client solicitation. Additionally, the award agreement provides for continued vesting in the event of an award recipient's retirement, subject to applicable restrictive covenants. To be eligible for retirement, an award recipient must provide notice of retirement, enter into a retirement agreement and satisfy a "Rule of 70," whereby the sum of the recipient's age and full years of service must equal at least 70. 
 Clawbacks 
 The award agreement permits AB to claw-back the unvested portion of an award if the recipient fails to adhere to our risk management policies. As such, for accounting purposes, there is no employee service requirement and awards are fully expensed when granted. As used in this Item 11, vest refers to the time at which the awards are no longer subject to forfeiture for breach of these restrictions or risk management policies, which we discuss further below in Consideration of Risk Matters in Determining Compensation. 
 Relocation-related Performance Awards 
 In April 2018, Ms. Burke and Mr. Sprules each was granted a special restricted AB Holding Unit award with a grant date fair value of 4,000,000. Each award vested on December 1, 2022, and the underlying AB Holding Units were delivered promptly thereafter (net of AB Holding Units withheld to cover applicable taxes) given each executive continued to be employed by AB and each executive had established his or her principal residence in Nashville, TN. Additionally, the Compensation Committee, with input from Mr. Bernstein, determined during its regular meeting held in September 2022 that: 
 our firm s headquarters relocation initiative has been executed without significant disruption or reputational damage to AB; 
 AB s targets for cost savings and implementation costs for the relocation have been achieved; and 
 the level of workplace talent and diversity in Nashville is satisfactory. 
 With respect to the above-referenced criteria, the Compensation Committee, with appropriate input from Mr. Bernstein, assessed achievement of the criteria both within the executive's business unit and with respect to our firm overall. 
 Former CFO and Head of Strategy Resignation 
 As announced in a Form 8-K we filed on March 23, 2022, Mr. Dibadj resigned from AB on March 22, 2022. His responsibilities as CFO promptly were transitioned to Mr. Siemers on an interim basis and then to Ms. Burke, effective July 6, 2022. 
 The compensatory benefits Mr. Dibadj forfeited by resigning included (i) unvested portions of prior-year long-term incentive compensation awards, aggregating to approximately 1.8 million in value (based on the closing price of an AB Holding Unit as of June 17, 2022, his official termination date taking into account the garden leave obligation provided in the ICAP award agreement); and (ii) the unvested portions of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards granted to him by EQH in connection with his membership on and service to EQH's Management Committee, aggregating to approximately 150,000 (based on the closing price of an EQH share as of June 17, 2022).

 Defined Contribution Plan 
 U.S. employees of AB, including each of our NEOs, are eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of AB (as amended and restated as of January 1, 2015, and as further amended as of January 1, 2017, as of April 1, 2018, and as of June 28, 2022, the AB Profit Sharing Plan ), a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. The Compensation Committee determines the amount of company contributions (both the level of annual matching by the firm of an employee s pre-tax salary deferral contributions and the annual company profit sharing contribution, if any). 
 With respect to 2022, the Compensation Committee determined in November 2022 that employee deferral contributions would be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 5 of eligible compensation and that there would be no profit sharing contribution paid by AB. 
 Defined Benefit Plan 
 We maintain a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plan (the AB Retirement Plan covering current and former employees who were employed by AB in the United States prior to October 2, 2000. Benefits are based on years of credited service, average final base salary (as defined in the AB Retirement Plan) and primary Social Security benefits. Service and compensation after December 31, 2008 are not taken into account in determining participants retirement benefits. Of our named executive officers, only Messrs. Sprules and Manley are eligible participants in the AB Retirement Plan. 
 The maximum annual benefit payable under the AB Retirement Plan may not exceed the lesser of 100,000 or 100 of a participant s average aggregate compensation for the three consecutive years in which he or she received the highest aggregate compensation from us or such lower limit as may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " Code "), on certain participants by reason of their coverage under another qualified retirement plan we maintain. The AB Retirement Plan generally provides for payments to, or on behalf of, each vested employee upon such employee s retirement at the normal retirement age provided under the plan or later, although provision is made for payment of early retirement benefits on an "actuarially" reduced basis. Normal retirement age under the AB Retirement Plan is 65. Death benefits are payable to the surviving spouse of an employee who dies with a vested benefit under the AB Retirement Plan. For additional information regarding interest rates and actuarial assumptions, see Note 18 to AB s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 A participant in the AB Retirement Plan is eligible for early retirement upon termination of employment if the participant is at least age 55 and the sum of the participant s age and years of vesting service equals at least 80. As of December 31, 2022, Mr. Sprules has attained age 49 and earned 25 years of vesting service. (For purposes of determining early retirement eligibility, years of service after benefits under the AB Retirement Plan ceased accruing are included.) Because Mr. Sprules is younger than age 55 and the sum of his age and service is less than 80, he is not eligible for early retirement. As of December 31, 2022, Mr. Manley has attained age 60 and earned 39 years of vesting service. Because the total of Mr. Manly s age and years of service exceeded 80, he is eligible for early retirement. 
 The early retirement benefit is actuarially reduced for each month that payments begin before age 65. The reduction to the pension is made because it costs more money to provide payments over a longer period of time. In other words, the monthly benefit commencing at the early retirement date has the same value as a monthly benefit beginning at age 65. The actuarial adjustment factors are based on the mortality assumptions specified under Section 417(e) of the Code and a 6.0 interest rate, as specified in the AB Retirement Plan. For example, a 60 year old participant (like Mr. Manley) would receive approximately 66 of the accrued benefit that would have been payable at age 65. 
 Other Benefits 
 Change in Control Plan 
 In December 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the AllianceBernstein Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers (the " CIC Plan "). The purpose of the CiC Plan is to provide certain benefits for each individual designated by our CEO as an executive officer (an " Executive Officer ") in the event of a change in control (" CIC ") of AB. The CIC Plan contains a change in control provision substantially similar to the change in control provision included in Mr. Bernstein's employment agreement as described below in "Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreemen t"). The provisions under the CIC Plan also are described in a compensatory table below entitled, Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. 
 The CIC Plan provides that, in the event of a CIC, unless prior to the CIC, any unvested restricted unit awards (including ICAP awards) then held by an Executive Officer are honored or assumed, or new rights are substituted therefore, so that the Executive Officer's rights and entitlements after the CIC are substantially equivalent to or better than the Executives Officer's rights and entitlements under the award, each award will, prior to the CIC, immediately and fully vest and no longer be subject to forfeiture. 
 In addition, (i) if the Executive Officer's employment is terminated by AB, other than for cause, (ii) the Executive Officer resigns with good reason (as defined in the CIC Plan), or (iii) the Executive Officer dies or becomes disabled, within 12 months following a CIC, the Executive Officer will be entitled to receive the sum of (a) the Executives Officer's annual base salary at the time of his or her termination, and (b) the Executive Officer's most recent annual cash incentive compensation award, multiplied by two. 
 142 
 AllianceBernstein 

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 The CIC Plan defines CIC to include any transaction as a result of which EQH ceases to control AB, or a successor entity that conducts the business of AB. However, there would not be a CIC unless, as a result of the transaction, an entity other than EQH controls AB (or a successor to its business). 
 Life Insurance 
 Our firm pays the premiums associated with life insurance policies purchased on behalf of our NEOs. 
 Consideration of Risk Matters in Determining Compensation 
 In 2022, we considered whether our compensation practices for employees, including our NEOs, encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and whether any risks arising from our compensation practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our firm. For the reasons set forth below , we have determined that our current compensation practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our firm. 
 As described above in Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards, long-term incentive compensation awards generally are denominated in AB Holding Units that are not distributed until subsequent years, so the ultimate value that the employee derives from the award depends on the long-term performance of the firm. Denominating the award in restricted AB Holding Units and deferring their delivery is intended to sensitize employees to risk outcomes and discourage them from taking excessive risks, whether relating to investments, operations, regulatory compliance and/or cyber security, that could lead to a decrease in the value of the AB Holding Units and/or an adverse effect on the firm's long-term prospects. Furthermore, and as noted above in Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards, generally all outstanding long-term incentive compensation awards include a provision permitting us to claw-back the unvested portion of an employee s long-term incentive compensation award if the Compensation Committee determines that (i) the employee failed to adhere to existing risk management policies and (ii) as a result of the employee s failure, there has been or reasonably could be expected to be a material adverse impact on our firm or the employee s business unit. 
 Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement 
 Pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Bernstein served as our President and CEO for an initial term that commenced on May 1, 2017 and ended on May 1, 2020. The initial term automatically was extended for one additional year on May 1, 2020 and automatically extends each May thereafter, unless the CEO Employment Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (the Employment Term ). 
 The terms of the CEO Employment Agreement were the result of arm s length negotiations between Mr. Bernstein and senior executives at AXA S.A., formerly AB's ultimate parent company (" AXA "), and EQH. The Board then approved the CEO Employment Agreement after having considered, among other things, the compensation package provided to Mr. Bernstein s predecessor, the 2016 compensation and 2017 expected compensation of AB s other executive officers and Mr. Bernstein s compensation at his former employer. 
 The Compensation Committee, during its regular meeting held in December 2018, amended the CEO Employment Agreement such that any annual equity award granted to Mr. Bernstein in 2018 and subsequent years during the Employment Term will be granted in all respects in accordance with AB's compensation practices and policies generally applicable to AB's executive officers as in effect from time to time (the " SPB First Amendment "). 
 Additionally, the Compensation Committee, during its regular meeting held in December 2019, further amended the CEO Employment Agreement by: 
 increasing Mr. Bernstein s severance payments if his employment is terminated involuntarily, without cause, from one year s base salary and bonus to one and a half year s base salary and bonus; 
 excluding from the definition of change in control AB Holding ceasing to be publicly traded; 
 removing from the circumstances that give rise to Mr. Bernstein s ability to terminate the agreement for good reason his ceasing to be the CEO of a publicly traded entity; and 
 eliminating Mr. Bernstein s entitlement to a gross-up for any excise tax on his parachute payments, which would have been pertinent only if Mr. Bernstein had been terminated involuntarily prior to December 31, 2019. 
 Elements of Mr. Bernstein s Compensation 
 Base Salary 
 Mr. Bernstein s annual base salary under the CEO Employment Agreement has been, and continues to be, 500,000. This amount is consistent with our firm s policy to keep base salaries of executives and other highly-compensated employees low in relation to total compensation. Any future increase to Mr. Bernstein's base salary is entirely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 Cash Bonus 
 Under the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Bernstein is entitled to be paid a cash bonus at a target level of 3,000,000 in each year during the Employment Term, subject to review and increase from time to time by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. As a result of a review of Mr. Bernstein's performance during 2022 by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Bernstein was paid a cash bonus of 4,925,000. In determining Mr. Bernstein's cash bonus, the Compensation Committee considered the progress AB made in advancing its Growth Strategy, Mr. Bernstein's performance in light of the target metrics included in his performance scorecard and Mr. Bernstein's individual achievements during 2022, as described above . 
 Restricted AB Holding Units 
 Commencing in 2018 and during the remainder of the Employment Term, Mr. Bernstein is eligible to receive annual equity awards with a grant date fair value equal to 3,500,000, subject to review and increase by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, in accordance with AB s compensation practices and policies generally applicable to the firm s executive officers as in effect from time to time. The Compensation Committee approved an equity award to Mr. Bernstein with a grant date fair value equal to 4,575,000 during November 2022. The Compensation Committee determined Mr. Bernstein's equity award based on the review process described above . As a result of the SPB First Amendment, the equity award granted to Mr. Bernstein in December 2022 is subject to the same ICAP-related terms and conditions as awards granted to other executive officers at that time, which terms and conditions are described above in "Compensation Elements for NEOs - Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards." 
 Perquisites and Benefits 
 Under the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Bernstein is eligible to participate in all benefit plans available to executive officers and, for his safety and accessibility, a company car and driver for business and personal use. 
 Severance and Change in Control Benefits 
 The CEO Employment Agreement includes severance and change-in-control provisions, which are highlighted below . These provisions also are described in a compensatory table below entitled, Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. We believe that these severance and change-in-control provisions assist in retaining our CEO and, in the event of a change in control, provide protection to Mr. Bernstein so he is not distracted by personal or financial situations at a time when AB needs him to remain focused on his responsibilities. 
 If Mr. Bernstein is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the CEO Employment Agreement), and he signs and does not revoke a waiver and release of claims, he will receive the following: 
 A cash payment equal to (a) the sum of his current base salary and his bonus opportunity amount, multiplied by one (1), if Mr. Bernstein resigns for "good reason," or (b) the sum of his current base salary and his bonus opportunity amount, multiplied by one and a half (1.5), if Mr. Bernstein's employment is terminated other than for "cause," or because of his death or disability; 
 a pro rata bonus based on actual performance for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs; 
 monthly payments equal to the cost of COBRA coverage for the COBRA coverage period; and 
 following the COBRA coverage period, access to participation in AB s medical plans as in effect from time to time at Mr. Bernstein s (or his spouse s) sole expense. 
 If, during the 12 months following a change in control, Mr. Bernstein is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, he will receive the amounts described above , except that he will receive a cash payment equal to two (2) times the sum of his current base salary and his bonus opportunity amount. 
 In the event any payments constitute golden parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such payments will be reduced to the maximum amount that does not result in the imposition of such excise tax, but only if such reduction results in Mr. Bernstein receiving a higher net-after tax amount than he would receive absent such reduction. 
 Mr. Bernstein is subject to a confidentiality provision, in addition to covenants with respect to non-competition during his employment and six months thereafter and non-solicitation of customers and employees for 12 months following his termination of employment. 
 A change in control is defined as, among other things, EQH and its majority-owned subsidiaries ceasing to control the election of a majority of the Board. 
 Mr. Bernstein negotiated the severance and change-in-control provisions described immediately above to have the security and flexibility to focus on the business and preserve the value of his long-term incentive compensation. The Board, AXA and EQH 
 144

 determined that these provisions were reasonable and appropriate because they were necessary to recruit and retain Mr. Bernstein and provided Mr. Bernstein with effective incentives for future performance. 
 The Board, AXA and EQH also concluded that the change-in-control and termination provisions in the CEO Employment Agreement fit within AB s overall compensation objectives because these provisions, which align with AB s goal of providing its executives with effective incentives for future performance, also: 
 permitted AB to recruit and retain a highly-qualified CEO; 
 aligned Mr. Bernstein s long-term interests with those of AB s Unitholders and clients; 
 were consistent with AXA s, EQH's and the Board s expectations with respect to the manner in which AB and AB Holding would be operated during Mr. Bernstein s tenure; and 
 were consistent with the Board s expectations that Mr. Bernstein would not be terminated without cause and that no steps would be taken that would provide him with the ability to terminate the agreement for good reason. 
 Compensation awarded by EQH to Mr. Bernstein, Ms. Burke, Mr. Erzan and Mr. Dibadj 
 In February 2022, EQH granted to Mr. Bernstein, in connection with his membership on and service to the EQH Management Committee: 
 a restricted stock unit award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 400,033; and 
 a performance share award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 600,029, which can be earned subject to EQH s total shareholder return relative to its peer group. 
 Additionally, in February 2022, EQH granted to each of Ms. Burke, Mr. Erzan and Mr. Dibadj, in connection with their membership on and service to the EQH Management Committee: 
 a restricted stock unit award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 40,021; and 
 a performance share award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 60,014, which can be earned subject to EQH s total shareholder return relative to its peer group. 
 Assumptions made in determining the EQH restricted stock unit and performance share figures discussed above are described in footnotes to the compensatory tables below entitled "Summary Compensation Table for 2022" and "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022." 
 Mr. Bernstein, Ms. Burke and Mr. Erzan may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to their continued membership on and service to the EQH Management Committee. Mr. Dibadj, who resigned as our firm's CFO and Head of Strategy in March 2022 (and from the EQH Management Committee), forfeited his awards and is ineligible for additional awards. 
 CEO Pay Ratio 
 In 2022, the compensation of Mr. Bernstein, our President and CEO, was approximately 71 times the median pay of our employees, resulting in a 71:1 CEO Pay Ratio. 
 We identified our median employee by examining 2022 total compensation for all individuals, excluding Mr. Bernstein, who were employed by our firm as of December 31, 2022, the last day of our payroll year. We included all of our employees in this process, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. We did not make any assumptions or estimates with respect to total compensation, but we did adjust compensation paid to our non-U.S. employees during our 2022 fiscal year based on the average monthly exchange rates for the three-month period ending September 30, 2022 (data compiled in fourth quarter) between the local currencies in which such employees are paid and U.S. dollars. We define total compensation as the aggregate of base salary (plus overtime, as applicable), commissions (as applicable), cash bonus and the grant date fair value of long-term incentive compensation awards. 
 After identifying the median employee based on total compensation, we calculated total compensation in 2022 for such employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth below in the Summary Compensation Table for 2022 . 
 As illustrated in the table below, our 2022 CEO Pay Ratio is 71:1 :

 Other Compensation-Related Matters 
 AB and AB Holding are, respectively, private and public limited partnerships. They are subject to taxes other than federal and state corporate income tax (see Structure-related Risks in Item 1A and Note 21 to AB s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ). Accordingly, Section 162(m) of the Code, which limits tax deductions relating to executive compensation otherwise available to an entity taxed as a corporation, is not applicable to either AB or AB Holding for 2022. 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 Mr. Pearson is a director and the President and CEO of EQH, the parent company of the General Partner. 
 No executive officer of AB serves as (i) a member of a compensation committee or (ii) a director of another entity, an executive officer of which serves as a member of AB s Compensation Committee. 
 Compensation Committee Report 
 The members of the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth above and, based on such review and discussion, recommended to the Board its inclusion in this Form 10-K.

 (2) As discussed above in Overview of 2022 Incentive Compensation Program and Compensation Elements for NEOs Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards, long-term incentive compensation awards granted in December 2022 to our NEOs were denominated in restricted AB Holding Units. These awards vest in equal annual increments on each of December 1, 2023, 2024 and 2025. These awards are shown in the All Other Stock Awards column of this table, the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2022 and the AB Holding Unit Awards columns of the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2022 Fiscal Year-End Table. 
 (3) In February 2022, EQH granted to each of Mr. Bernstein, Ms. Burke, Mr. Erzan and Mr. Dibadj (i) a restricted stock unit award with a grant date fair value of 400,033, 40,021, 40,021, and 40,021, respectively, and (ii) a performance share award with a grant date fair value of 600,029, 60,014, 60,014 and 60,014, respectively, which can be earned subject to EQH's total shareholder return (" TSR ") relative to its peer group. TSR is the total amount a company returns to investors during a designated period, including both capital gains and dividends. The number of performance shares that are earned will be determined at the end of the performance period (December 2024) by multiplying the number of unearned performance shares by one of the following performance factors: 200 if EQH's TSR relative to its peers is in the 87.5th percentile or greater; 100 if in the 50th percentile; 25 if in the 30th percentile; and nothing if falls below the 30th percentile. EQH performance shares receive dividend equivalents subject to the same vesting schedule and performance conditions as the performance shares themselves. The restricted stock unit awards, which vest in equal annual increments on each of February 28, 2023, 2024 and 2025, subject to continued service, increase or decrease in value depending on the price of an EQH common share. EQH restricted stock units receive dividend equivalents subject to the same vesting schedule and other requirements. 
 (4) Mr. Dibadj forfeited these awards. 
 (5) The award granted to Mr. Siemers in March 2022 cliff vests in February 2024 subject to Mr. Siemers's continued employment. 
 In 2022, the number of restricted AB Holding Units comprising year-end long-term incentive compensation awards granted to each NEO was determined based on the closing price of an AB Holding Unit as reported for NYSE composite transactions on December 12, 2022, the date as of which the Compensation Committee approved the awards. At the time of these awards, the Compensation Committee consisted of Ms. Matus (Chair) and Messrs. Kaye and Pearson; the Section 16 Subcommittee, which approved awards to our NEOs, consisted of Ms. Matus (Chair) and Mr. Kaye. For further information regarding the material terms of such awards, including the vesting terms and the formulas or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable, please refer to "Overview of 2022 Incentive Compensation Program" and "Compensation Elements for NEOs" above.

For further information, see Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement above. 
 (2) EQH restricted stock unit awards, which are described for Mr. Bernstein in the second line of data in the above table, will vest ratably over their three-year vesting period subject to continued employment during the vesting period. EQH performance share awards, which are described in the third line of data in the above table, cliff vest on the third anniversary of grant date subject to meeting the applicable performance criteria. In February 2022, 2021 and 2020, EQH granted to Mr. Bernstein (i) a restricted stock unit award with a grant date fair value of 400,033, 340,000 and 250,019, respectively, and (ii) a performance share award with a grant date fair value of 600,029, 510,000 and 500,031, respectively. The performance share awards granted in 2022 and 2021 can be earned subject to EQH's TSR relative to its peer group. Approximately half of the performance share award granted in 2020 can be earned subject to EQH's performance against specified non-GAAP financial targets (specifically, non-GAAP return-on-equity targets), while the other half has been earned subject to EQH's TSR relative to its peer group. Please see the table above entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022" for additional information regarding the EQH awards. 
 (3) The option awards described in the table were issued by EQH and calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of EQH stock options is calculated by EQH using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected EQH dividend rate is based on market consensus. EQH share price volatility is estimated on the basis of implied volatility, which is checked by EQH against an analysis of historical volatility to ensure consistency. The effect of expected early exercise is accounted for through the use of an expected life assumption based on historical data. 
 (4) EQH restricted stock unit awards, which are described for each of Ms. Burke and Mr. Erzan in their respective second lines of data in the above table, will vest ratably over their three-year vesting period subject to continued employment during the vesting period. EQH performance share awards, which are described in the third line of data in the above table, cliff vest on the third anniversary of grant date subject to meeting the applicable performance criteria. In February 2022 and 2021, respectively, EQH granted to each of Ms. Burke and Mr. Erzan (i) a restricted stock unit award with a grant date fair value of 40,021 and 40,000, respectively and (ii) a performance share award with a grant date fair value of 60,014 and 60,000, respectively, which can be earned subject to EQH's total shareholder return relative to its peer group. Please see the table above entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022" for additional information regarding the EQH awards.

 (1) The aggregate number of restricted AB Holding Units underlying awards outstanding but not yet distributed at December 31, 2022, was: for Ms. Lamm-Tennant, 5,765 AB Holding Units; for Ms. Domenici, 8,521 AB Holding Units; for Mr. Kaye, 12,390 AB Holding Units; for Ms. Matus, 12,125 AB Holding Units; for Mr. Narayandas, 12,390 AB Holding Units; for Mr. Stonehill, 12,390 AB Holding Units; and for Mr. Walthall, 6,066 AB Holding Units. 
 (2) Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For the assumptions made in determining these values, see Note 19 to AB s consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 Independent Director Compensation Elements 
 The Board approved the compensation elements described immediately below for Independent Directors during its regular meeting held in May 2021 and has agreed to re-consider such compensation elements bi-annually: 
 an annual retainer of 90,000 (paid quarterly after any quarter during which an Independent Director serves on the Board; annual retainers relating to Committee service, as described below, are paid quarterly in arrears as well); 
 an annual retainer of 50,000 for acting as Independent Chair of the Board; 
 an annual retainer of 37,500 for acting as Chair of the Audit Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 20,000 for acting as Chair of the Compensation Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 13,500 for acting as Chair of the Governance Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 12,500 for serving as a member of the Audit Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 9,000 for serving as a member of the Compensation Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 3,000 for serving as a member of the Governance Committee; and 
 an annual equity-based grant under an equity compensation plan consisting of restricted AB Holding Units with a grant date fair value of 170,000. 
 In 2022, the Board granted to each Independent Director then serving (which included Mses. Domenici, Lamm-Tennant and Matus and Messrs. Kaye, Narayandas, Stonehill and Walthall) 4,410 restricted AB Holding Units. The number of AB Holding Units granted was determined by dividing the 170,000 grant date fair value noted above by the closing price of an AB Holding Unit on the date of the May 2022 Board Meeting, or 38.55 per unit. These awards vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. 
 Further, in order to avoid any perception that our directors exercise of their fiduciary duties might be impaired, restricted AB Holding Unit grants to Independent Directors are not forfeitable, except if the director is terminated for Cause, as that term is defined in the 2017 Plan or the applicable award agreement. Accordingly, restricted AB Holding Units generally are delivered as soon as administratively feasible following an Independent Director s resignation from the Board. 
 Equity grants to Independent Directors generally are made at the May meeting of the Board. The date of the May meeting is set by the Board at least a year in advance. 
 The General Partner may reimburse any director for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attendance at Board meetings as well as additional Board responsibilities. AB Holding and AB, in turn, reimburse the General Partner for expenses incurred by the General Partner on their behalf, including amounts in respect of directors fees and expenses. These reimbursements are subject to any relevant provisions of the AB Holding Partnership Agreement and the AB Partnership Agreement.

 Independent Director AB Holding Unit Ownership Guidelines 
 Each Independent Director, by the later of five years from the initial implementation date of these guidelines (February 2018) and the date as of which the director's tenure on the Board begins, shall accumulate, either through accumulating AB Holding Units awarded by the Board or purchasing Units on the open market, AB Holding Units with a market value equal to five (5) times the director's annual retainer. Each Independent Director must maintain this ownership level for the duration of the director's tenure on the Board. 
 As of December 31, 2022, each Independent Director then serving either complied with this policy or was on track to do so within the allotted time.

 Partnership Matters 
 The General Partner makes all decisions relating to the management of AB and AB Holding. The General Partner has agreed that it will conduct no business other than managing AB and AB Holding, although it may make certain investments for its own account. Conflicts of interest, however, could arise between AB and AB Holding, the General Partner and the Unitholders of both Partnerships. 
 Section 17-403(b) of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act Delaware Act states in substance that, except as provided in the Delaware Act or the applicable partnership agreement, a general partner of a limited partnership has the liabilities of a general partner in a general partnership governed by the Delaware Uniform Partnership Law (as in effect on July 11, 1999) to the partnership and to the other partners. In addition, as discussed below , Sections 17-1101(d) and 17-1101(f) of the Delaware Act generally provide that a partnership agreement may limit or eliminate fiduciary duties a partner may be deemed to owe to the limited partnership or to another partner, and any related liability, provided that the partnership agreement may not limit or eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, while under Delaware law a general partner of a limited partnership is liable as a fiduciary to the other partners, those fiduciary obligations may be altered by the terms of the applicable partnership agreement. Each of the AB Partnership Agreement and AB Holding Partnership Agreement (each, a Partnership Agreement and, together, the Partnership Agreements sets forth limitations on the duties and liabilities of the General Partner. Each Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner is not liable for monetary damages for errors in judgment or for breach of fiduciary duty (including breach of any duty of care or loyalty), unless it is established (the person asserting such liability having the burden of proof) that the General Partner s action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury, with reckless disregard for the best interests of the Partnerships or with actual bad faith on the part of the General Partner, or constituted actual fraud. Whenever the Partnership Agreements provide that the General Partner is permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its discretion or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the General Partner is entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires and has no duty or obligation to consider any interest of or other factors affecting the Partnerships or any Unitholder of AB or AB Holding or (ii) in its good faith or under another express standard, the General Partner will act under that express standard and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by either Partnership Agreement or applicable law or in equity or otherwise. Each Partnership Agreement further provides that to the extent that, at law or in equity, the General Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to either Partnership or any partner, the General Partner acting under either Partnership Agreement, as applicable, will not be liable to the Partnerships or any partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of the Partnership Agreement. 
 In addition, each Partnership Agreement grants broad rights of indemnification to the General Partner and its directors, officers and affiliates and authorizes AB and AB Holding to enter into indemnification agreements with the directors, officers, partners, employees and agents of AB and its affiliates and AB Holding and its affiliates. The Partnerships have granted broad rights of indemnification to officers and employees of AB and AB Holding. The foregoing indemnification provisions are not exclusive, and the Partnerships are authorized to enter into additional indemnification arrangements. AB and AB Holding have obtained directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance. 
 Each Partnership Agreement also allows transactions between AB and AB Holding and the General Partner or its affiliates, as we describe in Policies and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons in Item 13, so long as such transactions are on an arms-length basis. The Delaware courts have held that provisions in partnership or limited liability company agreements that permit affiliate transactions so long as they are on an arms-length basis operate to establish a contractually-agreed-to fiduciary duty standard of entire fairness on the part of the general partner or manager in connection with the approval of affiliate transactions. Also, each Partnership Agreement expressly permits all affiliates of the General Partner to compete, directly or indirectly, with AB and AB Holding, as we discuss in Competition in Item 1 . The Partnership Agreements further provide that, except to the extent that a decision or action by the General Partner is taken with the specific intent of providing an improper benefit to an affiliate of the General Partner to the detriment of AB or AB Holding, there is no liability or obligation with respect to, and no challenge of, decisions or actions of the General Partner that would otherwise be subject to claims or other challenges as improperly benefiting affiliates of the General Partner to the detriment of the Partnerships or otherwise involving any conflict of interest or breach of a duty of loyalty or similar fiduciary obligation.

 Section 17-1101(c) of the Delaware Act provides that it is the policy of the Delaware Act to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract and to the enforceability of partnership agreements. Further, Section 17-1101(d) of the Delaware Act provides in part that to the extent that, at law or in equity, a partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) to a limited partnership or to another partner, those duties may be expanded, restricted, or eliminated by provisions in a partnership agreement (provided that a partnership agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing). In addition, Section 17-1101(f) of the Delaware Act provides that a partnership agreement may limit or eliminate any or all liability of a partner to a limited partnership or another partner for breach of contract or breach of duties (including fiduciary duties); provided, however, that a partnership agreement may not limit or eliminate liability for any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Decisions of the Delaware courts have recognized the right of parties, under the above provisions of the Delaware Act, to alter by the terms of a partnership agreement otherwise applicable fiduciary duties and liability for breach of duties. However, the Delaware courts have required that a partnership agreement make clear the intent of the parties to displace otherwise applicable fiduciary duties (the otherwise applicable fiduciary duties often being referred to as default fiduciary duties). Judicial inquiry into whether a partnership agreement is sufficiently clear to displace default fiduciary duties is necessarily fact driven and is made on a case by case basis. Accordingly, the effectiveness of displacing default fiduciary obligations and liabilities of general partners continues to be a developing area of the law and it is not certain to what extent the foregoing provisions of the Partnership Agreements are enforceable under Delaware law. 
 
 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 
 Policies and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
 Each Partnership Agreement expressly permits EQH and its subsidiaries (collectively, EQH Affiliates ), to provide services to AB and AB Holding if the terms of the transaction are approved by the General Partner in good faith as being comparable to (or more favorable to each such Partnership than) those that would prevail in a transaction with an unaffiliated party. This requirement is conclusively presumed to be satisfied as to any transaction or arrangement that (i) in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the General Partner meets that unaffiliated party standard, or (ii) has been approved by a majority of those directors of the General Partner who are not also directors, officers or employees of an affiliate of the General Partner. 
 In practice, our management pricing committees review investment advisory agreements with EQH Affiliates, which is the manner in which the General Partner reaches a judgment regarding the appropriateness of the fees. Other transactions with EQH Affiliates are submitted to the Audit Committee for their review and approval. See Committees of the Board in Item 10 for details regarding the Audit Committee.) We are not aware of any transaction during 2022 between our company and any related person with respect to which these procedures were not followed. 
 Our relationships with EQH Affiliates also are subject to applicable provisions of the insurance laws and regulations of New York and other states. Under such laws and regulations, the terms of certain investment advisory and other agreements we enter into with EQH Affiliates are required to be fair and equitable and charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable. Also, in some cases, the agreements are subject to regulatory approval. 
 We have written policies regarding the employment of immediate family members of any of our related persons. Compensation and benefits for all of our employees is established in accordance with our people practices, taking into consideration the defined qualifications, responsibilities and nature of the role. 
 Financial Arrangements with EQH Affiliates 
 The General Partner has, in its reasonable and good faith judgment (based on its knowledge of, and inquiry with respect to, comparable arrangements with or between unaffiliated parties), approved the following arrangements with EQH Affiliates as being comparable to, or more favorable to AB than, those that would prevail in a transaction with an unaffiliated party.

The Audit Committee then affirmatively indicates its approval of the listed engagements. Engagements that are not listed but that are of similar scope and size to those listed and approved may be deemed to be approved, if the fee for such service is less than 100,000. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman the ability to approve any permissible non-audit engagement where the fees are expected to be less than 100,000.

 INDEMNIFICATION 
 
 Section 1. Every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or an officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation or for its benefit as a director, an officer or a trustee of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an indemnitee ), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, an officer or a trustee, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, an officer or a trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent legally permissible under and pursuant to any procedure specified in the DGCL or other applicable Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment) , against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith. Such right of indemnification shall be a contract right which may be enforced in any manner desired by such person. Such right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and, without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to their respective rights of indemnification under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders, provision of law or otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article. 
 
 Section 2. In addition to indemnification pursuant to Section 1 of this Article, the corporation shall pay an indemnitee the expenses (including attorney s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an advancement of expenses provided, however, that, as the DGCL may require, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or an officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon receipt by the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under Section 1 of this Article or otherwise. 
 7 

Section 3. If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within one hundred and twenty (120) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be ninety (90) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or in an action brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the corporation. 
 Section 4. The board of directors (or its designee, including the corporate governance committee of the board) may cause the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or an officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or an officer of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred in any such capacity or arising out of such status, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person under the DGCL. 

8 

Section 5. The board of directors may from time to time adopt further by-laws with respect to indemnification and may amend these and such by-laws to provide at all times the fullest indemnification permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time.

DESCRIPTION OF ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN UNITS AND 
 ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN HOLDING L.P. UNITS 

General 
 
 Interests in AllianceBernstein L.P. ABLP are in the form of units of limited partnership interest ABLP units ). Interests in AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. AB Holding are in the form of units representing assignments of beneficial ownership of limited partnership interests AB Holding units ). AB Holding is the record owner of a number of ABLP units equal to the number of AB Holding units then outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, there were 113,801,097 AB Holding units outstanding and 285,979,913 ABLP units outstanding. 
 
 The Board of Directors (the GP Board of AllianceBernstein Corporation, the general partner, controls the activities of both AB Holding and ABLP. The Board is not classified. Unitholders of ABLP and AB Holding do not have the right to vote for members of the GP Board. The right to appoint members of the GP Board rests with Alpha Units Holdings, Inc. Alpha ), the sole stockholder of the general partner. Alpha is a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitable Holdings, Inc. EQH ). The common stock of EQH trades publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EQH. 
 
 Among other rights, Delaware law gives limited partners the right to maintain a derivative action, the right to exercise voting powers and the right to inspect and copy a partnership's books and records. The respective Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership of ABLP and AB Holding also grant limited partners such rights. 
 
 The general partner may, without the consent of the limited partners, amend either partnership agreement to qualify the partnership as a limited partnership or to preserve the limited liability of limited 
 partners. 
 
 ABLP units do not trade publicly and are subject to significant transfer restrictions. AB Holding units trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AB. 
 
 Restrictions on Transfers of ABLP Units 
 
 As noted above, ABLP units are subject to significant liquidity restrictions. In general, transfers of ABLP units are allowed only with the written consent of both EQH and ABLP s general partner. Only the written consent of EQH, and not the written consent of the general partner, is required for a block transfer, as described below, of units by a corporation or other business entity, provided that the partnership has received an opinion of counsel to the effect that the partnership will not be treated as a publicly traded partnership for tax purposes as a result of the transfer. Either EQH or, where applicable, the general partner may withhold its consent to a transfer in its sole discretion, for any reason. Generally, neither EQH nor the general partner will permit any transfer that it believes would create a risk that ABLP would be treated as a corporation for tax purposes. 
 
 ABLP does not recognize any transfer made without the appropriate consents. 
 
 EQH and the general partner may refuse to consent to any transfer that is not described in the safe harbors set forth in United States Treasury regulations. This fact does not imply, however, that either EQH or the general partner necessarily intends to permit transfers that are described in the safe harbors. Neither EQH, where relevant, the general partner is required to approve any transfer, and there can be no assurance that EQH or the general partner will approve a transfer even if the transfer would be permissible under the safe harbors. Permissible transfers under the safe harbors may include 
 
 (1) transfers at death 
 
 (2) transfers between certain family members and 
 
 (3) block transfers. 
 
 In general, a block transfer is the transfer within a 30-day period by a single holder, or group of related holders, of ABLP units representing more than 2 of the outstanding ABLP units. For these purposes, units held by EQH and its affiliates, other than AB Holding, will not be counted as outstanding. 
 
 Unitholders Have No Right to Direct the Business of AB Holding or ABLP 

The activities of AB Holding and ABLP are managed and controlled by the general partner. The general partner has agreed that it will conduct no active business other than managing AB Holding and ABLP, although it may make certain investments for its own account. Neither AB Holding unitholders nor ABLP unitholders have any rights to manage or control AB Holding or ABLP, or, as noted above, to elect directors of the general partner. 
 
 Change in Control 
 
 As noted above, the general partner controls the activities of AB Holding and ABLP, and the general partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQH. Accordingly, any change in control of AB Holding or ABLP would require a sale by EQH of its interest in the general partner and consent of EQH. 
 
 Comparison of ABLP and AB Holding Unitholder Rights 
 
 Set forth below is a comparison of AB Holding units and ABLP units. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the respective Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership of ABLP and AB Holding, each of which can be found on our firm s website, www.alliancebernstein.com. 
 
 Under Delaware law and the Partnership Agreements, ABLP unitholders and AB Holding unitholders have substantially similar voting rights. 
 
 The general partner may not be removed by AB Holding unitholders unless it is not, or is simultaneously removed as, the general partner of ABLP. The general partner also may not withdraw unless it is not, or simultaneously withdraws as, the general partner of both AB Holding and ABLP. 
 
 Voting Rights 
 
 AB Holding and ABLP unitholders generally have voting rights with respect to 
 
 the withdrawal, removal, transfer and replacement of the general partner 
 
 the merger or consolidation of AB Holding or ABLP with another entity, 
 
 the sale of all or substantially all of the assets owned, directly or indirectly, by either AB Holding or ABLP 
 
 the dissolution of either AB Holding or ABLP 
 
 certain types of amendments to the Partnership Agreements 
 
 reconstitution of AB Holding or ABLP 
 
 election, compensation and approval of a liquidating trustee 
 
 conversion or reorganization of AB Holding or ABLP into another type of legal entity 
 
 issuance of units that rank senior to the originally issued AB Holding units or ABLP units, as the case may be. 
 
 Each AB Holding unit and ABLP unit entitles the holder thereof to cast one vote on all matters presented to unitholders. 
 
 Approval of any matter submitted to unitholders generally requires the affirmative vote of unitholders holding more than 50 of the units then outstanding, except that 
 
 any transfer by the general partner of all or substantially all of AB Holding s or ABLP s assets where the general partner or its corporate affiliates have any direct or indirect equity interest in the person acquiring the partnership requires a vote of more than 50 of AB Holding or ABL unitholders, excluding employees of ABLP, their families, the general partner and its corporate affiliates 

withdrawal of the general partner requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 removal of the general partner without cause requires the vote of 80 of the outstanding units 
 
 except in limited circumstances, an election by the general partner to dissolve AB Holding or ABLP requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 in certain circumstances upon which AB Holding or ABLP would otherwise be dissolved, a unanimous vote of the unitholders to continue the business of the partnership is necessary to avoid dissolution 
 
 any amendment that would adversely alter the rights and preferences of AB Holding or ABLP units requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 any amendment that would adversely alter the rights and preference of any other class or series of units must be approved by a majority of that class and 
 
 any amendment for which AB Holding or ABLP does not receive a determination that as a result of such amendment 
 
 o the unitholders would not lose their limited liability pursuant to Delaware law or the applicable Partnership Agreement 
 
 o the partnership would not become subject to federal income tax or otherwise incur additional tax liabilities and 
 
 o certain advisory contracts of ABLP would not automatically be terminated or breached 
 
 requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates. 
 
 Only the general partner may propose amendments to either the ABLP Partnership Agreement or the AB Holding Partnership Agreement. 
 
 Any action that may be taken at a meeting of unitholders of AB Holding or ABLP may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting executed by unitholders of AB Holding or ABLP sufficient to authorize such action at a meeting of unitholders. 
 
 Distributions Taxation 
 
 AB Holding and ABLP each is required under its Partnership Agreement to distribute its available cash flow. 
 
 AB Holding is subject to a 3.5 federal tax on its gross business income. Otherwise, AB Holding is not subject to federal or state income tax. Rather, unitholders include their respective shares of AB Holding s income, gain, losses, deductions and credits in computing taxable income, without regard to the cash distributed to unitholders quarterly. Generally, cash distributions are not taxable, unless distributions 
 exceed a unitholder s basis in units. 
 
 ABLP is not subject to the 3.5 federal tax, or any corresponding state tax, on its gross business income. Otherwise, its tax treatment identical to the tax treatment of AB Holding. 
 
 For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, each ABLP unit will be paid 0.77 per unit, while each AB Holding unitholder will be paid 0.70 per unit. The difference in distribution rate primarily results from applicability of the 3.5 federal tax described immediately above. 
 
 Meetings 

Meetings of AB Holding unitholders may be called for any purpose with respect to which the unitholders are entitled to vote. Such meetings may be called by the general partner or by unitholders holding at least 50 of the issued and outstanding AB Holding units. 
 
 Meetings of ABLP unitholders may be called for any purpose with respect to which the unitholders are entitled to vote. Such meetings may be called by the general partner, by unitholders holding at least 25 of the issued and outstanding ABLP units or at the request of AB Holding, in its capacity as a limited partner of ABLP, pursuant to the request of AB Holding unitholders holding at least 50 of the issued and outstanding AB Holding units. AB Holding unitholders have the right to attend meetings of ABLP unitholders. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 
 In the event of the liquidation of either ABLP or AB Holding, the assets of the partnership remaining after the satisfaction of all debts and liabilities of the partnership will be distributed to unitholders pro rata in accordance with the positive balances in their capital accounts. Any remaining assets will be distributed to the unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests. 
 
 Right to Compel Dissolution 
 
 Under each Partnership Agreement, the general partner may dissolve AB Holding or ABLP if the general partner receives the approval of the holders of a majority of ABLP units or AB Holding units, as applicable, excluding units owned by the general partner and its corporate affiliates.

DEMISED PREMISES 
 Floor (entire floor unless otherwise noted) 
 Delivery Date Concourse (part) (Sup15 23(a), Sup17 13, Sup23 2a) Delivered. Ground Floor (part) 
 The Ground Floor (part) formerly leased to Alliance has been surrendered and deleted from the demised premises. Landlord has leased the Ground Floor (part) to Wachovia Bank, National Association Wachovia pursuant to the Agreement of Lease dated December 22, 2003 (the Wachovia Lease ), for a term coterminous with Alliance's lease which Wachovia may extend pursuant to its three 5-year extension options. If the term of the Wachovia Lease expires or terminates prior to the expiration or termination of Alliance s lease, then, on the day after said termination, the Ground Floor (part) will be added back to the demised premises on substantially the same terms (including the rent terms) as were in effect prior to its surrender and deletion from the demised premises (Sup21 3). For more information regarding the terms of the surrender of Ground Floor part, see below. 2, 8, 9, 11 through 14 (Sup15 2(a) Ltr2 Sup16 11) Delivered. 10 (Sup19 3(a))

 Ground Floor (part) 
 For a summary of the payments Alliance makes in lieu of rent and the credits Alliance receives in respect of the Ground Floor (part), see Monthly Fixed Rent, Tax Escalation and Expense Escalation. Other terms of the surrender and deletion of Ground Floor (part) from the demised premises are summarized below. 
 Enforcement Landlord will make reasonable efforts to enforce the Wachovia Lease (including the rent obligations). If Wachovia defaults under the Wachovia Lease, then Alliance may, at its option, participate in any action Landlord takes in respect of said default. If Landlord does not take any action, then Alliance may, at its option, (1) cause the Landlord to assign its right to proceed against Wachovia, in which case Alliance may then proceed directly against Wachovia provided that Alliance indemnifies Landlord from any loss arising from such action, or (2) require the Landlord to proceed against Wachovia in which case Alliance will reimburse Landlord within 30 days after demand for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Landlord in respect of enforcing the Wachovia Lease (Sup21 4(f)). 
 Amendments, Terminations, Extensions and Consents Landlord is prohibited from amending the Wachovia Lease or waiving any provision thereof without first obtaining Alliance s consent. Alliance must be reasonable in respect of consenting to any amendment that would not have an economic or adverse impact on Alliance and Alliance s failure to respond to a request for such a consent within 5 business days of receipt is deemed consent. Landlord is prohibited from terminating the term of the Wachovia Lease except in the event of a default thereunder or extending the term of the Wachovia Lease except pursuant to the express provisions thereof without first obtaining Alliance's consent (Sup21 5(a)). Landlord is prohibited from granting its consent to any matter contemplated by the Wachovia Lease (e.g., subleases and alterations) without first obtaining Alliance s consent. Alliance's rights in respect of Wachovia signage is summarized in more detail below. Alliance is required to be reasonable in granting its consent to any such matter if Landlord is obligated to be reasonable under the Wachovia Lease. Alliance is required to respond in the same time period as Landlord is obligated to 
 5 

respond to any request for consent and Alliance will be deemed to have given its consent if it fails to respond (Sup21 5(c) LTR3 3). 
 Signage Wachovia is prohibited from displaying signage on the window, doors or the exterior of the perimeter walls of its demised premises unless Wachovia obtains the prior written reasonable consent of the Landlord and said signage is in conformity with the building standard sign program (Wachovia Lease 46.2(e)). However, Wachovia has the right to install signage on the interior and exterior of the demised premises that conforms with Wachovia's standard national or NYC signage program provided that said signage pertains primarily to general retail banking, safe deposits or electronic banking and not to certain permitted ancillary uses (e.g. brokerage, insurance, investment services). Nevertheless, Wachovia has the right to display temporary signage which describes said ancillary uses in certain designated areas provided that Wachovia is obligated to remove said signage if either Landlord or Alliance reasonably believes that said temporary signage is not in keeping with the quality or character of the building. The size and location of signage on or visible from the exterior of the Ground Floor (part) is subject to the reasonable approval and Landlord and Alliance. Wachovia also has the right to display promotional banners provided the size, color and location of said banners is subject to the reasonable approval of Landlord and Alliance. Landlord's (and, therefore, Alliance's) failure to respond within 15 business days to any request for consent regarding signage is deemed consent (Wachovia Lease 46.3(a)). 
 Assignment Subletting Profits Landlord and Alliance will share equally any sublease or assignment of lease profits payable to Landlord under the Wachovia Lease (Sup21 6(a)). 
 Hold Over by Wachovia If Wachovia holds over following the termination of the Wachovia Lease term, then Landlord will promptly commence summary dispossess proceedings and will use commercially reasonable efforts to evict Wachovia. Landlord will pay to Alliance any amounts recovered from Wachovia arising from said proceedings after first deducting Landlord's actual out-of-pocket expenses, provided that if the amounts paid over by Landlord exceed the sums paid by Alliance in respect of the Ground Floor (part) for the corresponding period, then Landlord will be permitted to retain 50 of said excess (Sup21 8). 
 Reimbursement of Landlord on Account of Payments to Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. Alliance will reimburse Landlord up to 601,854.52 in respect of any amounts paid by Landlord to Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. arising from Sup21 (Sup21 10).

Check Meters All floors have check meters except for Floors 31 (part), 32-34, and 37-39, which will have check meters on or before November 1, 2009 (Sup9 5) and Floor 42, which will have check meters on or before May 1, 2011 (Sup25 4(c)(i)). The check meters measure electricity demand and consumption for each floor during a calendar month. Alliance pays Landlord, within 30 days after receipt of a bill, Landlord s cost of the electricity consumed based on the applicable rate charged to the Landlord by the supplying utility, plus a 2 administrative fee (Sup9 5(b) and (c) Sup12 4(b) and (c) Sup14 4(b) and (c) Sup15 4(b) and (c) Sup22 4(b) Sup24 4(b) Sup25 4(c) Sup26 4(b)). Landlord will provide check meters for any portion of the Concourse (part) space measuring at least 3,000 contiguous rsf (Sup15 23(f)(i)). If the check meters for Floors 31 (part), 32-34, and 37-39 are not installed by November 1, 2009, then Alliance will pay Landlord what Landlord s electrical consultant determines to be Landlord s cost for such electricity, provided that Alliance may dispute such determination in accordance with a specified procedure. Dispute Each bill is binding on Alliance unless Alliance disputes such bill within 90 days of receipt. In case of a dispute, Alliance s electrical consultant will submit its determination within such 90 day period and Landlord and Alliance will seek a resolution. Upon Alliance s request, Landlord will make available its utility bills for the building for at least the last 3 years. If Landlord and Alliance cannot agree, they will choose a third electrical consultant to perform a limited review (Sup12, 5(c)(ii) Sup12 4(c)(ii) Sup14 4(c)(ii) Sup15 4(c)(ii) Sup22 4(c)(ii) Sup24 4(c)(ii) Sup25 4(c)(iii) Sup26 4(b)).

Additional Capacity Upon notice from Alliance, Landlord will provide Alliance with (1) an additional 400 amperes in the aggregate for the 15 th and 16 th floors (Sup12 4(e)), and (2) up to another 1,800 amperes for the entire demised premises (Sup14 4(f)). Such notice will be given by Alliance on or before, with regard to the 15 th and 16 th floors, the date Alliance delivers to Landlord its plans for its initial fit-out of the 15 th floor (but in no event later than June 30, 2001), and, with regard to the rest of the demised premises, by December 31, 2001 (Sup12 4(e) and Sup14 4(e)). Alliance is responsible for any construction costs it would incur in connection with alterations relating to such additional electricity supply, as well as a pro-rata share of Landlord s construction costs (Sup12 4(e) Sup14 4(e) and Sup15 4(f)). 
 Discontinuance of Service Landlord may discontinue furnishing electricity to Alliance only if Landlord simultaneously discontinues service to 80 of the other building tenants (Sup15 4(d)), upon 60 days written notice, provided such period is extended as reasonably necessary to permit Alliance to obtain electricity from the utility company servicing the Building. In such case, Alliance may use the existing wiring. The cost of installation of any additional wiring will be borne, if such discontinuance is voluntary, by Landlord, and if such discontinuance is involuntary, by Landlord and Alliance with Alliance s share equal to the total cost of such additional wiring multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is remaining months of the Lease term and the denominator of which is as follows

A determination by Landlord of a change in the ERIF as a result of a survey of electrical consumption in the Demised Premises will be binding on Alliance unless Alliance disputes such determination within 15 days of receipt of such determination. If Alliance disputes such determination, it will have its own electrical consultant at its own cost, attempt to resolve the dispute in consultation with Landlord s electrical consultant. If they cannot agree on a resolution, they will choose a third electrical consultant who s decision will control (orig. 7.03(b)). 
 
 Electricity Rent Inclusion Factor for 42 nd Floor 
 Until May 1, 2011, the charge for electricity for Floor 42 is included in fixed annual rent. The initial amount of such charge is 5.81 per s.f. and is subject to increase or decrease (but in no event below 5.81 per s.f. per annum) in proportion to increases or decreases in Landlord s electricity costs for the building as well based on Alliance s electricity consumption. A determination by Landlord of a change in the rent inclusion charge as a result of a survey of electrical consumption in the Demised Premises will be binding on Alliance unless Alliance disputes such determination within 30 days of receipt of such determination. If Alliance disputes such determination, it will have its own electrical consultant at its own cost attempt to resolve the dispute in consultation with Landlord s electrical consultant. If they cannot agree on a resolution, they will choose a third electrical consultant who s decision will control (Sup25 4(b)). 
 
 Supplies At Landlord s option, Alliance is required to purchase (for a reasonable charge) from Landlord all lighting tubes, lamps, bulbs and ballasts used in the demised premises (orig. 7.05(b)). Concourse Space Subject to the following sentence, for any portion of the demised premises located on the concourse consisting of less than 3,000 contiguous rsf, Alliance will pay an ERIF of 0.75 rsf, subject to increase if Alliance uses the space for anything other than storage (Sup15 23(f)(ii)). For the portion of the demised premises located on the concourse and leased pursuant to Sup23, however, Landlord will provide electricity at no additional charge provided that if Landlord determines on a reasonable basis that Alliance is consuming excessive electricity, then Landlord may commence charging Alliance for such electricity on either (at Landlord s option) a rent inclusion or submeter basis.

The following summary is applicable to both such agreements. Unless otherwise noted, the section references are also applicable to both agreements. 
 Services The Cleaning Contractor provides certain cleaning services for the office areas and lavatories of the demised premises 1(a)). The cleaning services provided do not include the cleaning of below-grade space, kitchen, pantry or dining space, storage, shipping, computer or word-processing space, or private or executive lavatories 1(b)). The Cleaning Contractor is not responsible for removing debris and rubbish from areas under construction in the demised premises 2). The quality of the cleaning services will be comparable to that provided in first class buildings in midtown Manhattan 1(a)). Access The Cleaning Contractor has access to the demised premises from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on business days. The Cleaning Contractor has the right to use Alliance s light, power and water, as reasonably required 1(a)). Term The cleaning agreements are co-terminous with the Lease 2). Fee Alliance pays the Cleaning Contractor, for the office space, a fixed monthly fee of 310,465.73, plus an amount equal to the fee for Floor 36 multiplied by the percentage increase in the labor rate in 2000 over 1999, plus an amount equal to the fee for Floors 2, 8, 9, 11-14 multiplied by the percentage increase in the labor rate in 2001 over 2000, plus an amount equal to the fee for Floor 10 multiplied by the percentage increase in the labor rate in 2001 over 2000 (CAO 3 CAO-2 3 CAO-3 3 CAO-4 3 CAO-5 3 CAO-6 3 CAO-7 3 CAO-8 3 CAO-9 3 CAO-11 3).

 After-Hours Service Available upon reasonable notice at Landlord s established rates, payable upon presentation of bill, provided that 
 if any other tenants in the same air conditioning zone obtain after-hours service, the charge therefore will be equitably pro-rated (orig. 32.02(d)), and 
 Landlord will provide HVAC to Alliance free of charge on any non-business day that the New York Stock Exchange is open (Sup9 24(b)). 
 Supplemental AC Subject to the lease provisions (including the alterations section) and all applicable laws, Alliance may at its expense install self-contained package air-conditioning units in the demised premises. Alliance is responsible for the maintenance and repair of such units. Alliance may connect such units to any existing supplementary air-conditioning systems located in the demised premises as of the date the lease commenced with respect to the 37 th and 38 th floors (orig. 32.10). Alliance has the right to install at its own expense additional supplemental air conditioning in the demised premises subject to service being available from Landlord at Landlord s established per ton per annum connected load and line charge (Sup5 11(d)). Alliance has the right to install a supplemental air conditioning system on the 31 (part)-34 th , and 37 th -39 th floors and Landlord will provide condenser water therefor at a connected load and line charge fee of 500 per ton per annum increased after 1991 in proportion to the lease s expense escalations (Sup6 17 Sup7 19). 
 Condenser Water 
 Floors 2, 8-14 Alliance has reserved 190 tons of condenser water for use on the 2 nd and 8 th -14 th floors, with an option to reserve up to an additional 80 tons upon written notice to Landlord on or before 8 30 04. Landlord s charge for such condenser water is 568.35 plus annual increases based on the percentage increases in building and parking expenses. Alliance begins paying for such condenser water upon use (but no later after 1 year after delivery of the 2 nd and 8 th through 14 th floors). If Alliance requires more than 270 tons of condenser water for such space, then Landlord will use best efforts to obtain additional condenser from the building s existing supply and, if unsuccessful, will enter into good faith discussions regarding the installation of an additional cooling tower and allocation of costs relating thereto (Sup15 16(b)). 
 Floors 15-16 The 15 th floor has an existing supply of 12 tons of condenser water and the 16 th floor has an existing supply of 11 tons of condenser water. Alliance has the right to install at its own expense, pursuant to the alterations provisions of the Lease, a supplemental air-conditioning system on the 15 th and 16 th floors. Alliance was to have reserved its requirements of condenser water for such supplemental system from the existing supply on or before May 1, 1999 and of additional condenser water (up to 100 tons) by June 30, 2001 (Sup14 13(b)(ii)). We have been advised by Judd S. Meltzer Co. Inc., however, that Landlord has agreed to reduce such available tonnage to 60 tons in exchange for increasing the available tonnage to 100 tons with respect to Floors 35-36. Landlord s charge for such condenser water is 552 ton per annum plus annual increases over a 1997 base year (Sup12 14). 
 Floors 2, 8-14, 17 (part) Alliance was required to notify the Landlord of the amount of additional condenser water required by Alliance for its premises on Floors 2, 8-14 and 17 (part), which amount cannot exceed 20 tons, by August 31, 2002. Alliance begins paying for such condenser water upon use at a rate equal to 594.90 per ton per annum increased annually from 2001 at the same percentage rate that building operating expenses increase (Sup16 10(b)). 
 Floors 31 (part) - 34, 40, 41 We have been advised by Judd S. Meltzer Co. Inc. that Alliance has exercised its right to have Landlord supply Alliance with 250 tons condenser water for use in supplemental air conditioning units on Floors 31 (part)-34 or 40, 41 at a cost 250 ton yr for the first 250 tons yr and 500 ton yr (plus annual increases over the 1994 expenses base year). Any condenser water already being provided for Floors 31(part)-34 and 40, 41 are included in determining such rates. Alliance pays for the condenser water that Landlord has agreed to commit to Alliance, regardless of whether Alliance actually uses it (Sup9 24(f)). 
 Floors 35-36 Alliance may purchase up to 60 tons (in the aggregate) of condenser water for use in connection with its supplemental air-conditioning on the 35 th and 36 th floors. We have been advised, however, by Judd S. Meltzer Co. Inc. that Landlord has agreed to increase such available tonnage to 100 tons in exchange for reducing the available tonnage of additional condenser water to 60 tons with respect to Floors 15-16. Alliance must reserve the condenser water it wishes to purchase by February 8, 2001 (in respect of the 35 th floor) and December 31, 2001 (in respect of the 36 th floor) Landlord s charge for such condenser water is 568.35 ton per annum plus annual increases over a 1999 base year (Sup14 13(b)).

Subletting the demised premises, assigning the Lease, allowing others to use the demised premises, and advertising for a subtenant or assignee are not permitted without the consent of Landlord 15.01), which consent will not unreasonably be withheld 15.05) except with regard to the ground floor portion of the demised premises. Landlord has no recapture rights. Alliance may, without Landlord s consent, assign or sublet to a corporation into or with which Alliance is merged, with an entity to which substantially all of Alliance s assets are transferred, or to an entity which controls or is controlled by Alliance or is under common control with Alliance, subject to a net worth test 15.02). Also, Alliance may, without Landlord s consent, permit an affiliate (defined as an entity which controls or is controlled by Alliance or is under common control with Alliance to occupy all or a portion of the premises (orig. 15.08). Any permitted assignment or sublease will not be effective until Alliance delivers to Landlord a recordable sublease or assignment agreement reasonably satisfactory to Landlord pursuant to which the subtenant or assignee assumes all of Alliance s obligations under the Lease. Alliance will remain fully liable under the lease for the payment of rent and the performance of all of Alliance s other obligations under the Lease notwithstanding any such assignment or sublease (orig. 15.03). Landlord s Consent to assignment or sub-subletting by an assignee or subtenant Landlord s consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such further assignment or sub-sublease is subject to all of the other terms and conditions of the Lease regarding assignment and subletting (Sup7 12(b)). Profits If Alliance assigns the lease or sublets any portion of the demised premises other than to a corporation into which Alliance is merged or consolidated, or to which Alliance s assets are transferred or to any entity which controls or is controlled by Alliance or is under common control with Alliance, then Alliance will pay Landlord 50 of any profits after first deducting reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such assignment sublease amortized on a straight line basis over the balance of the lease term (in case of an assignment) or over the term of the sublease (in case of a sublease) (orig. 15.07). For the first 50 of rsf of demised premises other than ground floor space (including Floors 2 and 8-14 after such floors are delivered to Alliance (Sup15 19(a)) assigned or sublet by Alliance, Alliance will have the right to deduct as such a reasonable expense a Tenant Improvement Deduction , determined as of the commencement date of such sublease or assignment, and calculated as follows 
 ((A 2 B) C) x D, where 
 A amortized value of Alliance leasehold improvements (regardless of whether paid for with tenant allowance) based upon the average value of Alliance s unamortized leasehold improvements on a per rentable square foot basis for all of the demised premises other than any concourse space (Sup15 19(b) or ground floor space (Sup20 2(a)), amortized on a straight line basis from completion date until 10 31 09 (if located on Floors 37-39 and completed prior to 8 16 94 and such calculation is being made prior to the delivery of Floors 2 and 8-14 (Sup15 19(a))) or the lease expiration date (in all other cases) 
 B total landlord cash contribution or allowance to Alliance for leasehold improvements under the lease, 
 C total rsf of the demised premises, and 
 D rsf of the space being sublet or assigned. (Sup9 13(d)) 
 In determining profits, Alliance is permitted to take into account its electricity expenses under the lease and cleaning expenses (whether under separate agreement with Landlord s contractor or pursuant to the lease) (Sup9 13(d)), and its rental cost for the space being sublet or assigned will be determined using an average, on a rentable square foot basis, of its rental cost for the entire demised premises other than any concourse space or ground floor space (Sup20 2(b)) except with respect to any sublease or assignment of the 2 nd , 8 th -14 th or 17 th (part) floors made before Alliance ever occupies such space (which is the case for Floor 10 (Sup19 6(b)) in which case Alliance s rental cost will be based on its actual rental without including any deduction for unamortized tenant improvements (Sup15 19(d) Sup16 12, Sup17 11 Sup18 11). If Alliance subleases any part of Floors 2 and 8-14 or assigns the Lease with respect thereto after first occupying such space, then Alliance will have the right to take a Tenant Improvement Deduction as provided above.
