PART
I. 

ITEM
 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Lode-Star
Mining Inc. the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A., on December 9, 2004. The Company s principal
executive offices are in Reno, Nevada. The Company was originally formed to acquire exploration stage natural resource properties. 

On
January 14, 2022, the Company formally returned its 20 undivided interest in the Goldfield Bonanza Project to Lode Star Gold, Inc.,
the optionor of that property LSG ), pursuant to a settlement and termination agreement (the Settlement Agreement ). 

On
December 28, 2021, the Company acquired from Sapir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation Sapir ), all of the assets
used in connection with the proprietary stabilized formulation of the Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) molecule for further pharmaceutical
development. On June 6, 2022, the Company and Sapir agreed to rescind the acquisition due to circumstances beyond either party s
control. In connection with the rescission, the Company reinstated 2,246,146 in debt owed to LSG that was previously forgiven under
the Settlement Agreement in order to facilitate the Sapir transaction. 

On
June 21, 2022 the Company, LSG and certain related party creditors agreed to convert an aggregate of 2,601,207 in debt owed to those
parties into 70,302,906 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of 0.037 per share. 

At
present, the Company has no current business project and no cash generating operations. Management is actively seeking business opportunities. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The future of the Company
is dependent upon its ability to establish a business and to obtain new financing to execute its business plan. As shown in the accompanying
financial statements, the Company has had no revenue and has incurred accumulated losses of 4,263,323 as of December 31, 2022. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern, the
Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company is significantly dependent upon its ability and will
continue to attempt to secure additional equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and
without sufficient financing, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. 

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation
of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment. All dollar
amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. The financial statements have, in management s opinion, been properly prepared
within reasonable limits of materiality. 

The
Company has implemented all applicable new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. Those pronouncements did not have any material
impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK
 FACTORS 

You
should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing our common stock. The following risk factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability. 

We
have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable.
The company has no operations at the current time. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. 

Because
our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is substantial uncertainty that we will be able to continue our operations. 

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue to operate over the
next 12 months. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event we cannot continue in existence. As
such, if we are unable to obtain new financing to execute our business plan we may be required to cease our operations. 

We
may be unable to attract and retain qualified, experienced, highly skilled personnel, which could adversely affect the implementation
of our business plan. 

Our
success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled and qualified personnel. As we
become a more mature company in the future, we may find recruiting and retention efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed
in attracting, hiring and integrating such personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively. The
loss of any key employee, including members of our management team, and our inability to attract highly skilled personnel with sufficient
experience in our industry could harm our business. 

We
may indemnify our officers and directors against liability to us and our security holders, and such indemnification could increase our
operating costs. 

Our
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation allow us to indemnify our officers and directors against claims associated with carrying
out the duties of their offices. Our Bylaws also allow us to reimburse them for the costs of certain legal defenses. Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our officers, directors or control persons, we
have been advised by the SEC that such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable. 

Since
our officers and directors are aware that they may be indemnified for carrying out the duties of their offices, they may be less motivated
to meet the standards required by law to properly carry out such duties, which could increase our operating costs. Further, if any
of our officers or directors files a claim against us for indemnification, the associated expenses could also increase our operating
costs. 

Failure
to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. 

As
a Nevada corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which generally prohibits United States companies
from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some
foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery,
pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in the countries in which we conduct our business. However,
our employees or other agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are
found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Because
there is a limited public trading market for our common stock, investors may not be able to resell their shares. 

There
is currently a limited public trading market for our common stock. Therefore, there is no central place, such as stock exchange
or electronic trading system, to resell any shares of our common stock. If investors wish to resell their shares, they will have
to locate a buyer and negotiate their own sale. As a result, they may be unable to sell their shares or may be forced to sell them
at a loss. 

We
cannot assure investors that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. The trading of securities on the OTCQB is
often sporadic and investors may have difficulty buying and selling our shares or obtaining market quotations for them, which may have
a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Investors may not be able to sell shares at their purchase price or at
any price at all.

ITEM
 1A. 
 RISK
 FACTORS Continued) 

The
sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and have a material adverse
effect on our earnings. 

Any
sale of common stock by us in a future private placement offering could result in dilution to the existing stockholders as a direct result
of our issuance of additional shares of our capital stock. In addition, our business strategy may include expansion through the acquisition
of additional property interests or through business combinations with entities operating in our industry. In order to do so, or
to finance the cost of our operations, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders stock ownership. We
may also pursue debt financing, if and when available, and this could negatively impact our earnings and results of operations. If the
board of directors issues an additional class of voting for less than fair value, the value of your interest in the company will be diluted.
We have no present intention to issue any additional class of voting securities. 

We
are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and investors may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock. 

Our
common stock is subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the penny
stock rules . Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stock, and Rule 15g-9(d) incorporates the
definition of penny stock that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines a penny stock
to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. We are subject to the
SEC s penny stock rules. 

Since
our common stock is deemed to be penny stock, trading in the shares of our common stock is subject to additional sales practice
requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited
investors. Accredited investors are generally persons with assets in excess of 1,000,000 (excluding the value of
such person s primary residence) or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together with their spouse. For
transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such security
and must have the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction
involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure
document relating to the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the
broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be
sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in an account and information to the limited market in penny
stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock
and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock. 

There
can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rules. In any event, even if our common
stock was exempt from the penny stock rules, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the
authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be
in the public interest. 

We
do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We
do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development
and growth of our business. Therefore, our stockholders will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock, and stockholders
may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all. 

Investors
may face significant restrictions on the resale of their shares due to state blue sky laws. 

Each
state has its own securities laws, commonly known as blue sky laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state s
residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting
requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there
must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must
also be registered in that state. 

We
do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding
registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. There may be
significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. Investors
should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as they may be unable to resell their shares without
the significant expense of state registration or qualification.

 PROPERTIES 

The
Company currently has no Properties. 

On
January 14, 2022, we executed a settlement and termination agreement (the Settlement Agreement with LSG in order to terminate
the mineral option agreement between the parties (the Option Agreement pursuant to which we acquired an interest in the
Goldfield Bonanza Project. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we and LSG have agreed to the immediate termination of the Option Agreement
(other than certain standard provisions that will survive according to their terms), with the result that we will return our 20 undivided
interest in and to the Property to LSG. In exchange, LSG has agreed to forgive all amounts owing by us to LSG under the Option Agreement,
which includes approximately 2.224 million in accrued, unpaid penalty and other payments. The Settlement Agreement also includes a broad
mutual release. Importantly, the Settlement Agreement does not require LSG to surrender any portion of the 35,000,000 shares of our common
stock that LSG previously received in consideration for selling us a 20 interest in the Property. 

The
full terms of the Settlement Agreement had been agreed to between the parties prior to December 31, 2021, with the signing of the documentation
left as a formality to be completed as soon as the final documents were drafted. For that reason, the impact of the agreement has been
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, to most accurately reflect our financial position on December 31, 2021.

the definition of penny stock that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines a penny stock
to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. We are subject to the SEC s
penny stock rules. 

Since
our common stock is deemed to be penny stock, trading in the shares of our common stock is subject to additional sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Accredited investors 
are generally persons with assets in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together with their spouse.
For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities
and must have the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving
a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document prepared
by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price
information for penny stocks held in an account and information to the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may
restrict the ability of broker-dealer to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders
to sell their shares. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no subscriptions for shares of our common stock. 

On
June 8, 2022, and in connection with the rescission of the Sapir Agreements, we entered into a debt reinstatement agreement (the Reinstatement
Agreement with LSG pursuant to which we agreed to reinstate the debt. Also on June 8, 2022, we entered into debt conversion agreements
with three related parties, including LSG, pursuant to which the creditors settled an aggregate of 2,601,207 in accrued, unpaid debt
into 70,302,906 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.037 per share. 

Within
the past three years, other than the above and the following, we have not issued any equity securities that were not registered under
the Securities Act. 

On
 March 4, 2021, we issued 28,571 common shares upon the cashless exercise of 50,000 stock
 options.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Funding 

All
of our ongoing operations, since October 4, 2014, have been funded by monies advanced to us by LSG our largest shareholder and one other
related party, LSG s primary shareholder. Given the termination of our Mineral Property Option Agreement with LSG, we do not anticipate
that those two related party sources will continue to provide any significant future funding. 

We
do not currently have enough funds to carry out our entire plan of operations, so we intend to meet the balance of our cash requirements
for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing through private placements.

ITEM
 7. 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

There
is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings. 

If
we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising efforts, we may review other financing options,
although we cannot provide any assurance that any such options will be available to us or on terms reasonably acceptable to
us. Further, if we are unable to secure any additional financing then we plan to reduce the amount that we spend on our
operations, including our management-related consulting fees and other general expenses, so as not to exceed the capital resources
available to us. Regardless, our current cash reserves and working capital will not be sufficient for us to sustain our
business for the next 12 months, even if we decide to scale back our operations. 

Going
Concern 

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business
for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our expenses. This is because we have not generated any revenues
to date, and we cannot currently estimate the timing of any possible future revenues. Our only source for cash currently is loans or
investments by others in our common stock. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
do not have any intellectual property. 

Personnel 

We
have no employees. Our president and CEO, our COO and our Corporate Secretary received no compensation in the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021 for their services, other than 100,000 in consulting fees incurred for 2021 and 50,000 for 2022 to another company controlled
by our CEO. We expect to continue to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary. See Item 10 for information
regarding our officers and directors. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following comments on our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2022 which are included with this Report. See the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements above
for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Report. We recorded net
income of 2,030,931 for the year ended December 31, 2022, have an accumulated deficit of 4,263,323 and have had no operating revenues.
The possibility and timing of revenue being generated from our business is uncertain.

As
of the date of this report, we have yet to generate any revenues from our business operations. Our principal sources of working capital
have been related party loans and funds received as subscriptions for our common stock. We have no assurance that we can successfully
engage in any private sales of our securities or that we can obtain any additional loans. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Commitments 

We
do not have any commitments as of December 31, 2022 which are required to be disclosed in tabular form. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
critical accounting policies are mainly those subject to significant judgments and uncertainties which could potentially result in materially
different results under different conditions and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our most
significant estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements: 

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions 

The
preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty
and the effect on the financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be significant. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Significant areas requiring management s estimates and assumptions are determining the fair value of transactions
involving related parties and common stock. Actual results may differ from the estimates. 

Foreign
Currency Accounting 

Our
functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Branch office activities are generally in Canadian dollars. Transactions in Canadian currency
are translated into U.S. dollars as follows: 

monetary
items at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date; 

non-monetary
items at the historical exchange rate; and 

revenue
and expense items at the rate in effect of the date of transactions. 

Gains
and losses arising on the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are recorded in the statements of operations. 

Income
Taxes 

We
use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. This standard
requires the use of an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting on income taxes. If it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is
recognized. 

Reclamation
Liabilities and Asset Retirement Obligations 

We
have no asset retirement obligations, including environmental rehabilitation expenditures, which relate to an existing condition caused
by past operations.

Acquired
in-process research and development IPR D income (expense) includes the initial costs of IPR D projects, acquired
directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use and is expensed on acquisition.
Following the rescission of the Sapir Agreements, the expensed IPR D was reversed through the income statement. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB or other standard
setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently
issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Lode-Star Mining Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Lode-Star Mining Inc. (the Company as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows, and changes in stockholders deficiency for the years then
ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
concern uncertainty 

The
accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company incurred losses from operations since inception, has not attained profitable operations
and is dependent upon obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its operating activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also discussed in
Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements; and (2) involved our especially challenging, 

subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit
matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

We
have determined that there are no critical audit matters to communicate in our auditors report.

shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock where each preferred share is convertible
into shares of common stock. 

Due
to circumstances beyond the control of both parties, the Company was unable to develop the Assets. As a result, on June 6, 2022, the
Company entered into a rescission agreement with Sapir (the Rescission Agreement in order to rescind the Sapir Agreements
and restore both the Company and Sapir to the respective positions we occupied immediately in advance of the execution and delivery of
the Sapir Agreements. 

As
of the date of the Rescission Agreement, the Company did not issue the Preferred Stock to Sapir or execute any payments to Sapir under
the Royalty Agreement. 

As
a result of the rescission, we entered into a debt reinstatement agreement (the Reinstatement Agreement with LSG pursuant
to which we agreed to reinstate the in debt to LSG that was previously written off in accordance with the settlement and termination
agreement in order to facilitate the Sapir transaction . 

as of December 31, 2022. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, to identify new business opportunities and raise additional capital resources to successfully develop
those business opportunities. The Company is significantly dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure additional
equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be
unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company
cannot continue in existence. 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and the related adverse
public health developments have adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets, leading to a global economic downturn.
Governments and central banks have reacted with significant monetary and fiscal interventions designed to stabilize economic conditions.
The duration and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown at this time, as is the efficacy of the government and central bank interventions. 

The
financial statements have, in management s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the
framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below: 

Termination
of the Option Agreement 

On
January 14, 2022, in connection with the Sapir Agreements (note 4), the Company executed a settlement and termination agreement (the
 Settlement Agreement with LSG to terminate the Option Agreement between the parties. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
the Company and LSG have agreed to the immediate termination of the Option Agreement (other than certain standard provisions that will
survive according to their terms), with the result that the Company will return its 20 undivided interest in and to the Property to
LSG. The carrying value of the 20 undivided interest was 230,179 at the date of the Settlement Agreement. In exchange, LSG has agreed to forgive all amounts owing by the Company to LSG under the Option Agreement, which includes 
in accrued, unpaid penalties and other payments. The Settlement Agreement also includes a broad mutual release. 

The
full terms of the Settlement Agreement were agreed to between the parties prior to December 31, 2021, with the formal execution to be
completed as soon as the documentation was prepared. Therefore, the impact of the Settlement Agreement has been reflected in the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, to most accurately report the Company s financial position on December 31, 2021,
resulting in a gain on settlement of shareholder debt of recognized in stockholders deficiency. 

On
June 8, 2022, and in connection with the rescission of the Sapir Agreements (note 4), we entered into a debt reinstatement agreement
(the Reinstatement Agreement with LSG pursuant to which we agreed to reinstate the Debt. Also on June 8, 2022, we entered
into debt conversion agreements with three related parties, including LSG, pursuant to which the creditors converted
an aggregate of in accrued, unpaid debt into shares of our common stock at a price of 0.037 per share. 

shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock nominally valued
at 1.00 per share (to be issued). Sapir has the right to convert each preferred share to 450 shares of common stock. Each preferred
share votes as shares per one share of common stock. 

The
Company recorded the transaction as an asset acquisition as management concluded that all of the gross value received was related to
the Assets. The fair value of the assets acquired was estimated to be 2,186,917 using level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Further,
as the Assets were still in development at the time of acquisition, management concluded that there was no alternative future use for
the Assets and recorded a charge to acquired in-process research and development expense of 2,186,917 at the closing of the transaction,
which consisted of the value assigned to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be issued in connection with the Purchase Agreement. 

The
Royalty Agreement requires the Company to pay Sapir a royalty equal to five percent (5 of the gross revenues realized from licenses
or products generated or derived from the Business, including all license and/or sublicense fees, development and/or research fees, grants,
joint ventures and other royalty payments received directly or indirectly by the Company. The royalty is due each quarter commencing
when the Company first receives revenues generated by the Assets. The royalty is to be paid for 5 years from the first date that initial
proceeds are received by the Company directly or indirectly from the Business, and is automatically extended for a single additional
5-year period unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the Royalty Agreement. No amount has been accrued for the royalty payable
as management cannot reliably estimate an amount payable. 

In
June 2022, due to circumstances beyond the control of both parties, the Company entered into a Rescission Agreement to terminate the
Sapir Agreements and restore both the Company and Sapir to their respective positions immediately in advance of the execution and delivery
of the Sapir Agreements. 

As
of the date of the Rescission Agreement, the Company had not completed the issuance of the Preferred Stock to Sapir or completed any
payments to Sapir under the Royalty Agreement. 

shares of common stock with a par
value of per share, and shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share. The Company reserved 10,000,000
shares of common stock for issuance under its 2016 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. The Company has issued common shares and
no preferred shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued shares of its common stock in three debt
settlement agreements dated June 8, 2022. 

Options 

On
November 20, 2018, the Company granted 500,000 non-qualified stock options pursuant to its Equity Incentive Plan, to key outside consultants.
Each option is exercisable into one share of the Company s common stock at a price of 0.06 per share, for a term of five years.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 50,000 of the options were exercised on March 4, 2021 on a cashless basis, resulting in the issuance

 CHANGES
 IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Effective
August 1, 2020, our auditors, Morgan Company LLP, 609 Granville Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, merged their operations with Smythe
LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, 475 Howe Street, Suite 1700, Vancouver, BC, Canada and continue to provide services to us as
Smythe LLP. 

There
have been no disagreements regarding accounting and financial disclosures from the inception of our company through the date of this
report on Form 10-K. Our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included in this report, have been audited
by Smythe LLP. 

ITEM

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures
of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective,
due to the size and nature of the existing business operation. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity
to implement disclosure control procedures is limited. Until such time as the organization can increase sufficiently in size to warrant
an increase in personnel required to effectively execute and monitor formal disclosure control procedures, those formal procedures will
not be implemented. As a result of the current size of the organization, there are not significant levels of supervision, review, independent
directors or a formal audit committee. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial
statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization;
and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect
on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement
of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2022, of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective, due to the size and nature of the existing business operation. Given the size of our current operation and existing
personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited.
Until such time as the organization can increase sufficiently in size to warrant an increase in personnel required to effectively execute
and monitor formal internal control procedures, those formal procedures will not be implemented. As a result of the size of the current
organization, there are not significant levels of supervision, review, independent directors or a formal audit committee. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The
Company owed to Lode Star Gold, Inc: 

5,637

than as described above and in Item 11, Executive Compensation, we have not entered into any transactions with our officers, directors,
persons nominated for these positions, beneficial owners of 5 or more of our common stock, or family members of those persons wherein
the amount involved in the transaction or a series of similar transactions exceeded the lesser of 120,000 or 1 of the average of our
total assets for the last two fiscal years. 

Director
Independence 

Because
our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we currently use the definition in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2)
for determining director independence, which provides that an independent director is a person other than an executive
officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company s Board of
Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The
NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if: 

the
director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company; 

the
director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of 120,000 during any period of 12
consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other
things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

a
family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company; 

the
director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which
the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5 of
the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); 

the
director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three
