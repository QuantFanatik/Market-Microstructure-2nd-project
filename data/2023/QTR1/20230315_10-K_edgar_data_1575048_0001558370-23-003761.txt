PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Development of Business ATEL 16, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on December 27, 2012 Date of Inception for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Managing Member, LLC (the Managing Member or Manager ), a Nevada limited liability company. The Managing Member is controlled by ATEL Financial Services, LLC AFS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group. The Fund may continue until terminated as provided in the ATEL 16, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated November 1, 2013 (the Operating Agreement ). Contributions in the amount of 500 were received as of December 31, 2012, which represented the initial member s capital investment. As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a base price of 10 per Unit. As of March 6, 2014, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2014. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least 7.5 million. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on June 19, 2014, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts. The offering was terminated on November 5, 2015. As of December 31, 2022, cumulative gross contributions, less rescissions and repurchases (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs, as applicable), totaling 42.9 million (inclusive of the 500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received. As of the same date, 4,274,486 Units were issued and outstanding. The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that will (i) preserve, protect and return the Company s invested capital; (ii) generate regular cash distributions to Unit holders during the Offering Stage and Operating Stage of the Fund, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions, equal to not less than 7 nor more than 9 per annum on investors Original Invested Capital, during the Operating State, to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (the first six years after the year the offering terminates); and (iii) provide additional cash distributions during the Liquidating Stage, commencing with the end of the Operating Stage/Reinvestment Period and continuing until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed. The Company is governed by the Operating Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Managing Member and/or its affiliates receive compensation for services rendered and reimbursements for costs incurred on behalf of the Company (See Note 7, Related party transactions, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The Company is required to maintain reasonable cash reserves for working capital, the repurchase of Units and contingencies. The repurchase of Units is solely at the discretion of the Managing Member. Narrative Description of Business The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers. The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as the core operating equipment used by companies in the manufacturing, mining and transportation industries. A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment. 
 1 

The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase. Through December 31, 2022, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of 43.6 million. The Company had also funded investments in notes receivable totaling 7.6 million through December 31, 2022. The Company s objective is to have at least 75 of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits. High quality corporate credits are lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa3 or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities. The remaining 25 of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, and other debt or equity financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above. Included in this 25 of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments. No more than 25 of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments. The equipment financing industry is highly competitive. Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment. The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence. The Managing Member will use its best efforts to diversify lessees by geography and industry and to maintain an appropriate balance and diversity in the types of equipment acquired and the types of leases entered into by the Company, and will apply the following policies: (i) The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20 of the aggregate purchase price of investments as of the final commitment of net offering proceeds; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20 of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or 30,000,000); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20 of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer. However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest. The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities is North America. Most of the Company s current operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in North America. See Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The business of the Company is not seasonal. The Company has no full time employees. Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate. The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement. For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes.

Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement. Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop. In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. Fund Valuation Background to Fund Valuation The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC updated rules for the presentation of account statement values relative to pricing of Direct Placement Program DPP shares. Under FINRA Notice 15-02 (the Notice the SEC approved amendments to National Association of Securities Dealers NASD Rule 2340, Customer Account Statements, and FINRA rule 2310, which address a FINRA member firm s participation in a public offering of a DPP. In summary, the amendments require a FINRA member firm to include in the account statements for customers holding DPP securities a per share value for the DPP. This per share value must be prepared by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service. The results of this valuation must be disclosed in the issuer s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A valuation in compliance with the Notice must be undertaken and published on at least an annual basis. The effective date of the Notice was April 11, 2016. Methodologies Broker dealers are required to provide a per share estimated value on the customer account statements for each non-listed DPP security held by their customers. Such estimated value must have been developed in a manner reasonably designed to provide a reliable value. Two valuation methodologies have been defined by FINRA, which by such designation are presumed to be reliable. Net Investment Methodology The amendments to NASD Rule 2340(c)(1)(A) require net investment to be based on the amount available for investment percentage disclosed in the Estimated Use of Proceeds section of the issuer s offering prospectus. In essence, such value is equal to the offering price less selling commissions, other offering and organization expenses, and capital reserves. This method may be used for up to 150 days following the second anniversary of a Fund breaking escrow. Appraised Value Methodology As amended, Rule NASD 2340(c)(1)(B) requires that the per share estimated value disclosed in an issuer s most recent periodic or current report be based upon an appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the program by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service, in conformity with standard industry valuation practice as it relates to both the aforementioned assets and liabilities. No later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the issuer s break of escrow for its minimum offering, this methodology must be used to establish the required estimated values.

Unit Valuation The per Unit valuation estimate for ATEL 16, LLC has been conducted, and the results disclosed herein, in compliance with the mandates of the Notice. For ATEL 16, LLC , its estimated value per Unit reflects the Manager s estimate of current portfolio valuation of all assets and liabilities of the Fund, calculated on a per Unit basis, and as such, does not represent a market value for the Units and may not accurately reflect the value of the Fund Units to the Unit holders if held over time to Fund maturity. In connection with any estimate of per Unit value, Unit holders and all parties are reminded that no public market for the Units exists. Additionally, in order to preserve the Fund s pass-through status for federal income tax purposes, the Fund will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units. In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. The estimate of per Unit value does not take into account any extraordinary potential future business activity of the Fund; rather the valuation represents a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date. In addition, the Fund does not include any analysis of the distributions that have already been paid by the Fund, nor the anticipated returns to Unit holder over the full course of the Fund life cycle, which will be dependent on many factors. Disclosure The estimated value per Unit reported in this Form 10-K has been calculated using the Appraised Value Methodology described above under Methodologies above, as of December 31, 2022. ATEL 16, LLC , will satisfy the disclosure requirements for providing estimated per Unit values pursuant to the Notice as follows: For these disclosure, subsequent to the Fund s initial compliance with FINRA 15-02, annual disclosures of estimated per unit values, through the termination of the Fund, will be accomplished and included on an annual basis in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available to the public. Specifics Underlying Valuation Methodology: Notes and Explanation of Valuation Components and Calculation A. Fund Assets and Liabilities (other than as specifically identified below) : The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as current assets and liabilities are assumed to equal their reported GAAP balances as an appropriate approximation of their fair values. Debt (interest bearing) is assumed to equal the fair values of the debt as disclosed in the footnotes of the financial statements. B. Investment in equipment and leases (net of fees and expenses) : The estimated values for equipment are based on calculating the present value of the projected future cash flows. Projected future cash flows include both the remaining contractual lease payments, plus assumptions on lease renewals and sale value of the residuals. Projected future cash flows are net of projected future fees and expenses including: management fees applicable for the Fund (1.25 of the aggregate original equipment cost of Portfolio Assets during offering stage, 1.75 of the aggregate net Portfolio Assets during operating stage and 1.75 of the Book Value of the Fund Assets less total cash reported as of the end of the most recent prior fiscal quarter or year, as the case may be) carried interest applicable for the Fund (0.01 of distributions) operating expenses which are assumed to be 3 of original equipment costs for the Fund 
 
 6 

Projected future cash flows have been discounted back to present value at discount rates based on like-term U.S. Treasury yields (as of the valuation date) plus a 400 basis point spread, to account for the credit risk differentials between the instrument being valued and U.S. Treasury security yields. Residual values assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows: For On-Lease and Month-to-Month Lease : Considers realized residual as a percent of book residual of 168.7 , based on ATEL s historical track record as of December 31, 2022. For Off-Lease : A current fair market value of off-lease equipment is based upon estimates from ATEL s seasoned Asset Management Group. Special Situation Leases : The valuation of certain leases has been performed outside of the above noted protocol based upon specific lease assumptions different than the macro assumptions above, due to the specific situations of those leases. C. Investments in Notes Receivable : The estimated values for Investments in Notes Receivable are estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market value techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary. D. Investments in Equity Securities : The estimated values for Investments in Equity Securities have been based on the estimated net book value as of the valuation date (with impairment adjustments), plus any unrealized gain on equity. The unrealized gain on equity is based on either: a) the most recent round of financing, b) the most recent 409A valuation provided by the underlying companies of the warrants, or c) the Manager s estimate of the company valuations based on all available information, including company financials, company valuation reports, public press releases, and other sources. E. Warrants Outstanding: The estimated values for Warrants Outstanding considers the reported GAAP balances to be an appropriate approximation of their fair values. F. Accrued distributions : Accrued distributions, which are payable to the Unit holders have been removed from the balance sheet liability section because they are not a liability to a third party. 
 ATEL 16, LLC Unit Valuation The Manager s estimated per Unit value of ATEL 16, LLC at December 31, 2022 as determined, and derived under the guidelines of the Appraised Value Methodology, and pursuant to the above specific enumerated component valuation methodologies and calculations, equals 3.84. An independent national public accounting firm with valuation expertise was retained to examine, attest and confirm ATEL 16, LLC s per Unit valuation and its component methodologies and calculation as it relates to compliance with the regulatory mandate defined in the Notice. In this regard, they examined the components of the valuation methodologies and determined them to be reasonable and within industry standards. Other component attributes, including the bases and related key assumptions of the calculation were tested for their completeness, underlying documentation support and mathematical accuracy. Upon completion of their efforts, their attestation report confirmed that the per unit valuation of ATEL 16, LLC, and the related notes, in all material respects, was based upon industry practice as described in the Manager s valuation approach. Disclaimer The foregoing Fund per Unit valuation has been performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated value per Unit in accordance with a regulatory mandate, in order to provide the broker dealer and custodian community with a valuation on a reasonable and attested basis for use in assigning an estimation of a Unit holder s account value. Any report or disclosure of such estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by statements that the value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Unit holder were to seek to sell the Units, and that the Fund intends to liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and over the Fund s term. Further, each statement of the Fund s estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by a disclosure that there can be no assurance as to (1) when the Fund will be fully liquidated, (2) the amount the Fund may actually receive if and when the Fund seeks to liquidate its assets, (3) the amount of lease or loan payments the Fund will actually receive over the remaining 
 7 

term, (4) the amount of asset disposition proceeds the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, and (5) the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unit holders over the course of the remaining term. Distributions The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement. The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of April 2014. Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2022. Cash distributions were paid by the Fund to Unitholders of record as of November 30, 2022, and paid through December 31, 2022. Distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each. Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital. The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets. See the discussion in the ATEL 16, LLC Prospectus dated November 5, 2013 Prospectus under Income, Losses and Distributions Reinvestment. Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to Unitholders will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets. Cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the leases and loans acquired. During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital. The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees. The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms. Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law. Overview ATEL 16, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on December 27, 2012 Date of Inception for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a price of 10 per Unit. As of March 6, 2014, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2014. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least 7.5 million. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on June 19, 2014, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts. The offering was terminated on November 5, 2015. As of December 31, 2022, 4,274,486 Units were issued and outstanding. During 2015, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units. Subsequently, during the reinvestment period Reinvestment Period (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company has reinvested and will reinvest cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the members and/or utilized its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment. Throughout the Reinvestment Period which ends December 31, 2021, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations. The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement Operating Agreement dated November 1, 2013 as amended. The Company may continue until terminated as provided in the ATEL 16, LLC Operating Agreement. Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member. It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100 utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year. All equipment is acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high during the funding period and throughout the reinvestment stage. Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment. All of the Company s equipment on lease was purchased in the years 2014 through 2021. The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 100 and 59 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The significant increase in utilization percentage was attributable to sales or re-lease of previously held off-lease equipment.

Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member and/or affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company. These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred. Results of Operations The Company had net income of 88 thousand and a net loss of 857 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Compared to prior year, the results for 2022 reflect an increase in operating revenues, and decreases in total operating expenses and other loss related to the Company s investment securities and warrants. Revenues Total operating revenues increased by 710 thousand, or 22 . Such increase was attributable to a favorable change in gains/losses realized on asset sales and an increase in other revenue partially offset by decreases in operating lease revenue and interest income on notes receivable. The favorable change in gains/losses realized on assets sales totaled 830 thousand and was primarily a result of a change in the mix of assets sold. Other revenue increased by 120 thousand, net primarily due to an 871 thousand insurance settlement related to a coal plant loading facility, which was partially offset by a 766 thousand decrease in deferred maintenance fees related to returned equipment with excessive wear and tear. The coal plant is still fully functional and is currently under lease. Such increases in revenues was partially offset by a 173 thousand decline in operating lease revenue, which was attributable to lease run-off and sales of lease assets. In addition, interest income on notes receivable decreased by 67 thousand due to note maturities. Expenses Total operating expenses declined by 105 thousand, or 3 , primarily due to reductions in storage fees, cost reimbursements to the Manager, interest expense, other expense and acquisition expense. Such reductions were partially offset by increases in taxes on income and franchise fees, and depreciation expense. Storage fees decreased by 140 thousand largely due to the decline in off-lease inventory resulting from sales or re-lease. Cost reimbursements to the Manager was reduced by 103 thousand due to lower allocated costs reflective of the Fund s declining assets. Interest expense decreased by 42 thousand due to the scheduled run-off of the Fund s borrowings under non-recourse debt. Other expense decreased by 37 thousand primarily due to lower allocated bank charges, and acquisition expense declined by 32 thousand due to the absence of acquisition activity during 2022. Partially offsetting such decreases in expenses were increases of 171 thousand and 112 thousand in taxes on income and franchise fees, and in depreciation expense. The increase in taxes was largely due to a settlement of excise taxes related to revenues generated by certain equipment, while the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to incremental depreciation on re-leased equipment with adjusted residual values. Other loss During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded other losses totaling 286 thousand and 416 thousand, respectively, to reflect both unrealized and realized losses and gains on the Fund s investment securities, warrants and options portfolio. Most of the unrealized losses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, totaling 287 thousand and 521 thousand, respectively, were related to one of the Company s publicly traded equity securities, which had experienced a significant price reduction during 2021. The price of such equity securities continued to decline during the current year, albeit at a lower amount. During the prior year, the Company recorded 49 thousand of unrealized gains on options which expired during the first quarter of 2022, upon which the Company realized a 1 thousand gain on the transactions. In addition, the Company realized gains totaling 78 thousand from sales of equity securities valued at 619 thousand. There were no such sales during the current year.

Capital Resources and Liquidity At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 5.3 million and 4.8 million, respectively. The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales. The Company currently believes it has adequate reserves available to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements. The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes. Cash Flows The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands): 

2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,874 2,080 Investing activities 2,686 3,286 Financing activities (4,024) (4,165) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 536 1,201 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s primary source of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating lease contracts, principal payments on its investments in notes receivable, and proceeds from sales of lease assets and/or early termination of notes receivable. Principal payments received on the notes receivable totaled 101 thousand and 458 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; and proceeds from sales of lease assets totaled 2.5 million and 2.7 million for the same respective years. In addition, the Company received 50 thousand of proceeds from sales of options during the current year. There were no options sold during the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received 697 thousand of proceeds from sales of securities, and 42 thousand of proceeds from early termination of notes receivable. There were no such sales of securities or early termination of notes receivable during the current year. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash was primarily used to pay distributions and to repay borrowings under non-recourse debt. Distributions paid to Other Members totaled 3.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021; and cash used to repay non-recourse debt totaled 1.0 million and 1.2 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, the Company used 584 thousand to acquire lease assets during the year ended December 31, 2021. There were no lease asset acquisitions during the current year. Cash was also used to pay invoices related to management fees and expenses, and other payables in both years. Revolving credit facility Effective June 30, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement (the Credit Facility which replaced a previous agreement which had an expiration date of June 2021. The Company participated with ATEL Capital Group and certain subsidiaries and affiliated entities as borrowers, with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders. The Credit Facility had an aggregate amount of 55 million and is comprised of a working capital sub-facility, institutional leasing sub-facility, and a venture line sub-facility. The Company participates in the acquisition sub-facility and the institutional leasing sub-facility, on a several, but not joint, basis (i.e., the Company is liable only for the amount of the advances extended to the Company under those sub facilities, and not as to amounts extended to any co-borrower). The Company s reinvestment period ended as of December 31, 2021. As such, the Company will no longer purchase lease assets and does not have a need to use the Credit Facility. Accordingly, effective as of December 12, 2022, the Credit Facility was amended and the Company ceased to be a participant in the Credit Facility. 
 11 

Non-Recourse Debt As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling 1.1 million and 2.1 million, respectively. Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants. The notes are secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. Long-Term Debt As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no long-term debt other than described above as non-recourse long-term debt. Distributions The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of April 2014. Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2022. See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions. Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions Commitments and Contingencies At December 31, 2022, there were no commitments to purchase lease assets or to fund investments in notes receivable. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions None. Item 8.

 Provision for doubtful accounts Balance December 31, 2021 Balance December 31, 2021 Provision for doubtful accounts Balance December 31, 2022 The Company evaluates the credit quality of its financing receivables on a scale equivalent to the following quality indicators related to corporate risk profiles: Pass Any account whose lessee/debtor, co-lessee/debtor or any guarantor has a credit rating on publicly traded or privately placed debt issues as rated by Moody s or S P for either Senior Unsecured debt, Long Term Issuer rating or Issuer rating that are in the tiers of ratings generally recognized by the investment community as constituting an Investment Grade credit rating; or, has been determined by the Manager to be an Investment Grade Equivalent or High Quality Corporate Credit per its Credit Policy or has a Not Rated internal rating by the Manager and the account is not considered by the Chief Credit Officer of the manager to fall into one of the three risk profiles below. Special Mention Any traditional corporate type of account with potential weaknesses (e.g., large net losses or major industry downturns) or, any growth capital account that has less than three months of cash as of the end of the calendar quarter to fund their continuing operations. These accounts deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date. Substandard Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected. Such accounts are on the Manager s Credit Watch List. Doubtful Any account where the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Accordingly, an account that is so classified is on the Manager s Credit Watch List, and has been declared in default and the Manager has repossessed, or is attempting to repossess, the equipment it financed. This category includes impaired notes and leases as applicable.

 The Fund s Operating Agreement places an annual and cumulative limit for cost reimbursements to AFS and/or its affiliates. Any reimbursable costs incurred by AFS and/or affiliates during the year exceeding the annual and/or cumulative limits cannot be reimbursed in the current year, though such costs may be reimbursable in future years to the extent such amounts may be payable if within the annual and cumulative limits in such future years. The Fund is a finite life and self-liquidating entity, and AFS and its affiliates have no recourse against the Fund for the amount of any unpaid excess reimbursable administrative expenses. The Fund will continue to require administrative services from AFS and its affiliates through the end of its term, and will therefore continue to incur reimbursable administrative expenses in each year. The Fund has determined that payment of any amounts in excess of the annual and cumulative limits is not probable, and the date any portion of such amount may be paid, if ever, is uncertain. When the Fund completes its liquidation stage and terminates, any unpaid amount will expire unpaid, with no claim by AFS or its affiliates against any liquidation proceeds or any party for the unpaid balance. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not exceeded the annual and/or cumulative limitations discussed above. to per annum. The notes are secured by assignments of lease payments and pledges of assets. At December 31, 2022, gross operating lease rentals totaled approximately million over the remaining lease terms; and the carrying value of the pledged assets is million. The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants. The debt is secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lender on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lender has recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company. Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lender, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations. Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure. 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter million and is comprised of a working capital sub-facility, institutional leasing sub-facility, and a venture line sub-facility.

Upon the repurchase of any Units by the Fund, the tendered Units are cancelled. Units repurchased in prior periods were repurchased at amounts representing the original investment less cumulative distributions made to the Unitholder with respect to the Units.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures The Company s Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Company does not control the financial reporting process, and is solely dependent on the Management of the Managing Member, who is responsible for providing the Company with financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Managing Member s disclosure controls and procedures, as they are applicable to the Company, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of the Management of the Managing Member; and (2) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 35 

Management of the Managing Member assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, Management of the Managing Member concluded that the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, was effective as of December 31, 2022. This annual report does not include an audit report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s internal control over financial reporting was not subject to audit by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which exempts non-accelerated filers from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Changes in internal control There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.

Code of Ethics A Code of Ethics that is applicable to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Managing Member, LLC, or persons acting in such capacity on behalf of the Company, is included as Exhibit 14.1 to this report. Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The registrant has no officers or directors. Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates. The amount of such remuneration paid for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is set forth in Item 8 of this report under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Financial Statements Related party transactions, at Note 7 thereof, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest The Company pays the Manager an annual Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 1.25 of the aggregate Purchase Price of Portfolio Assets acquired by the Fund through the end of each month during the period. Upon commencement of the Operating State; the period starting with the final sale of Units and ending six calendar years after the final sale of units, and the first two years of the Liquidating Stage; the period occurring after the Operating Stage until the final sale of units, the Company will pay the Manager an annual Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to an annualized 1.75 of the aggregate net Portfolio Assets, calculated for each month during the period as the aggregate Purchase Price of Portfolio Assets as of the end of the month, less the amount of the aggregate Purchase Price of Portfolio Assets attributable to Portfolio Assets which have been sold or otherwise disposed by the Fund through the end of the month. The Asset Management Fee payable for services rendered during the reminder of the Liquidating Stage will be equal to an annualized 1.75 of the Book Value of Fund Assets less total cash reported as of the end of the most recent prior fiscal quarter or year, as the case may be. The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis. The Manager supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data. The Manager intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services. The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 0.01 of all Company Distributions. Limitations on Fees The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations. While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines. The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines. The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. NASAA is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states. NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ). Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors. Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund. The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA 
 38 

Fee Limitation ). Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Asset Management Fee Limit . The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below. To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation. To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period. Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation. Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80 of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625 for each 1 of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75 of such Gross Proceeds. The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50 of the aggregate cost of its equipment. The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875 of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment. Based on the formula in the NASAA Guidelines, the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would equal 76.875 of Gross Proceeds (80 - [50 .0625 ] = 76.875 ), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9 . The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation. The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1 for the first 2.5 of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1 for the next 2 of such excess, and 1 for each additional 1 of excess Investment in Equipment. With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875 , the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5 of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5 + 2 + 4.5 = 9 ; 1 + 1 + 4.5 = 6.5 ). At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5 of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1 of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8 per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15 of all Distributions. With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5 of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5 + 5 = 11.5 ), and 7.5 of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5 + 1 = 7.5 ), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5 of all Distributions thereafter. The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest. If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation. The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above. A comparison of the Front End Fees

actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.

Exhibit 14.1 ATEL 16, LLC CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OFFICER A. SCOPE This Code of Ethics is applicable to ATEL 16, LLC Fund 16 ), including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Managing Member, LLC AMM ), or persons acting in such capacity (collectively the Covered Officers on behalf of Fund 16, referred to herein as the Company. Accordingly, under the Securities and Exchange Commission s interpretation of its disclosure rules, the Board of Directors of the Manager of AMM, ATEL Financial Services, LLC AFS ), functions as the de facto audit committee for the Company with respect to all procedural and disclosure requirements applicable to audit committees under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The Board of Directors shall have oversight responsibility over the activities of the Company for purposes of this Code of Ethics. B. PURPOSE The Company is proud of the values with which it conducts business. It has and will continue to uphold the highest levels of business ethics and personal integrity in all types of transactions and interactions. To this end, this Code of Ethics serves to (1) emphasize the Company s commitment to ethics and compliance with the law; (2) set forth basic standards of ethical and legal behavior; (3) provide reporting mechanisms for known or suspected ethical or legal violations; and (4) help prevent and detect wrongdoing. This Code of Ethics is intended to augment and supplement the standard of ethics and business conduct expected of all Company employees, and its limitation to Covered Officers is not intended to limit the obligation of all Company employees to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity in all transactions and interactions conducted while in the Company s employ. Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide. Confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Officers should remember the Company s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek independent advice, where necessary, to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment. C. ETHICS STANDARDS 1. Honest and Ethical Conduct The Covered Officers shall behave honestly and ethically at all times and with all people. They shall act in good faith, with due care, and shall engage only in fair and open competition, by treating ethically competitors, suppliers, customers, and colleagues. They shall not misrepresent facts or engage in illegal, unethical, or anti-competitive practices for personal or professional gain. 2. Conflicts of Interest This fundamental standard of honest and ethical conduct extends to the handling of conflicts of interest. The Covered Officers shall avoid any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company, and any personal activities, investments, or associations that might give rise to such conflicts. They shall not compete with or use the Company, for personal gain, self-deal, or take advantage of any corporate opportunities. They shall act on behalf of the Company free from improper influence or the appearance of improper influence on their judgment or performance of duties. A Covered Officer shall disclose any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict to the Company s General Counsel or a member of the Company s Board of Directors. No action may be taken with respect to such transaction or party unless and until the Company s Board of Directors has approved such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood, as fully disclosed in the offering documents for the Company, that AMM as managing member of the Company has certain inherent conflicts of interest. The provisions of the Company s Operating 

 Agreement have been drafted to address the obligations, restrictions and limitations on the power and authority of AMM to manage the Company s affairs, including restrictions prohibiting or limiting the terms of any transactions in which conflicts of interest may arise. Furthermore, AMM has a fiduciary duty to the Company as its manager. It is therefore expressly understood by the Company and the Covered Officers that any and all actions by AMM and its personnel that comply with the provisions of the Company s Operating Agreement, and which are consistent with AMM s fiduciary duty to the Company, will not be considered material transactions or relationships which require disclosure or reporting under this Code of Ethics. 3. Timely and Truthful Disclosure In reports and documents filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators by the Company and in other public communications made by the Company, the Covered Officers shall make disclosures that are full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable. The Covered Officers shall provide thorough and accurate financial and accounting data for inclusion in such disclosures. The Covered Officers shall not knowingly conceal or falsify information, misrepresent material facts, or omit material facts necessary to avoid misleading the Company s independent public auditors or investors. 4. Legal Compliance In conducting the business of the Company, the Covered Officers shall comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations at all levels of government in the United States and in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Company does business, as well as applicable rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations of which the Company is a member. If the Covered Officer is unsure whether a particular action would violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation, he or she should seek the advice of inside counsel (if available), and, where necessary, outside counsel before undertaking it. D. VIOLATIONS OF ETHICAL STANDARDS 1. Reporting Known or Suspected Violations The Covered Officers will promptly bring to the attention of the Company s General Counsel or the Board of Directors any information concerning a material violation of any of the laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company and the operation of its businesses, by the Company or any agent thereof, or of violation of this Code of Ethics. The Company s General Counsel will investigate reports of violations and the findings communicated to the Company s Board of Directors. 2. Accountability for Violations If the Company s Board of Directors determines that this Code of Ethics has been violated, either directly, by failure to report a violation, or by withholding information related to a violation, it may discipline the offending Covered Officer for non-compliance with penalties up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this Code of Ethics may also constitute violations of law and may result in criminal penalties and civil liabilities for the offending Covered Officer and the Company.
