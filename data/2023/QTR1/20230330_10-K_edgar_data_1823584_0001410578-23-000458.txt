 Compact Discs Vinyl continues to surpass CD sales. CD Revenues in the US in 2021 were 584 million. Sales in the United States have dropped from 122.9 million shipments in 2015 to only 31.6 million shipments in 2021. Alliance historically over-indexes the industry compared to CD revenues in the United States due to its Amped division adding more exclusive labels to distribute. DVD and Blu-Ray Disc versions of video game consoles allow those users access to play the disc version of movies. Broadband speeds are not always ideal for high quality streaming even in developed countries. This problem is worse in developing countries. However, factors such as access to digital copies of films, and on-demand streaming services have caused DVD sales to decline. Shipments are expected to decrease from 46.6 million in 2019 to 16.1 million in 2025. Forecast for unit shipments shows an overall decline of 16.2 CAGR from 2019 2025. DVD s biggest competitor, the online streaming services market is expected to grow by 191.72 billion during 2021 2025 with a CAGR of 18 . Alliance historically over-indexes the industry compared to DVD and BluRay revenues in the United States because of Distribution Solution s division adding more exclusive studio products to distribute. Market Opportunity The Company has identified two primary market areas where it currently conducts business and plans to grow its business: Content Media The global content media market is expected to grow from 289.13 billion in 2021 to 308.97 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 6.9 . The film and music market growth are mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach 392.34 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 6 . Despite the rise of digital distribution models, 64 of console consumers still prefer to buy their games on disc. The global animation collectibles market is poised to grow by 1.24 billion during 2021 2025, progressing at a CAGR of over 4 during the same period. 
 Fulfillment The global e-commerce fulfillment services market size was valued at 77.57 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 from 2021 to 2028 168.72 billion). Consumer electronics is expected to emerge as the fastest-growing segment registering a CAGR of over 12 from 2021 to 2028. The market is anticipated to witness substantial growth during the period due to the proliferation of the e-commerce industry, especially in emerging markets leading to an unprecedented rise in the number of online buyers. This trend implies North America will not grow as quickly as other global segments. It is anticipated that fulfilment in North America will continue to be funneled into established brands (for example, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target).

The Company s market leadership is further protected by a three-pronged moat of services, selection, and technology. The Company s platforms create efficiencies, which benefit its partners in the physical media and entertainment marketplace. As a result, both suppliers and retailer customers rely on the Company s platforms to fuel transaction volume. Organic Growth Opportunities. Through the expansion of partnerships with vendors and customers as well as investment in existing facilities, Alliance expects to continue to grow revenue and expand margins. Proven track record of building scale through significant acquisitions. Since inception, Alliance has successfully acquired and integrated nine businesses that have greatly expanded our vendors and customers we are supporting. This M A activity has built scale and added capabilities to the Company s platforms. Further, Alliance has demonstrated an ability to integrate those companies into its existing platforms to fundamentally improve the acquired businesses. Alliance management believes there remain significant consolidation opportunities to drive future growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses and competitors. Modern technology distribution platform and interface. The Company s technology platform increases the efficiency of transactions, provides great mobile accessibility, and incorporates modern marketing and Fintech tools. 
 Strategy for Future Growth Alliance will continue to capitalize on its services, selection, and scalable distribution network technology, to propel its future growth both organically and through acquisitions. With a public listing, we have access to additional capital to finance future growth. Our strategy will include: Execute Acquisition Strategy. Alliance has a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating competitors and complementary businesses. With additional capital, Alliance will be able to execute on its acquisition strategy more effectively.

 Increase Market Share. Expanding its existing product and service offerings and executing its acquisition strategy will drive Alliance s efforts toward increasing market share. The Company has historically built scale and added capabilities through acquisitions. It has demonstrated an ability to execute accretive and synergistic acquisitions as well as integrate and fundamentally improve the acquired businesses. Alliance expects to continue pursuing strategic opportunities that strengthen its platforms, expand the breadth and depth of its content, and enhance its distribution infrastructure. Alliance will continue to actively monitor and evaluate these and future opportunities in its acquisition pipeline in both the near and mid-term. Enhance DTC Relationships and Capabilities. Alliance s DTC services are in greater demand as consumer preferences shift and stress retailers e-commerce and DTC capabilities. Enhancing DTC relationships will grow existing revenue lines and improving capabilities will generate a more attractive overall service offering. Expand into New Consumer Products. Leveraging existing relationships, Alliance can expand into new consumer product segments, growing its product offering and providing more to its existing customer base while attracting new customers in the process. Continue Technological Advancement. Alliance will further invest in automating facilities and upgrading proprietary software. 
 Suppliers Alliance distributes and markets over 600,000 products worldwide from approximately 400 of the industry s premier physical media entertainment products suppliers. Typically, it maintains over 425,000 SKUs of unique items in its on-hand inventory. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were 23 suppliers in the top 80 of Alliance s purchase expenditures and five suppliers representing approximately 48 . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, there were 26 suppliers in the top 80 of Alliance s product purchases by expenditures. The top five suppliers as a group represented 53 of its purchase expenditures. No single supplier comprised more than 15 of Alliance s total purchases for the year ended June 30, 2022. Alliance has written supply agreements with many of its suppliers and these agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries, and in some cases certain channels, in which it may distribute the products. Some of Alliance s agreements with suppliers may contain limitations of liability with respect to our suppliers obligations and warranties. Historically, warranty expense has not been material. The agreements also are generally short-term, subject to annual renewal, and in some cases contain provisions permitting termination by either party without cause upon relatively short notice. Certain supply agreements either require (at our option) or allow for the repurchase of inventory upon termination of the agreement. In cases in which suppliers are not obligated to accept inventory returns upon termination, some suppliers will nevertheless elect to repurchase the inventory while other suppliers will assist with either liquidation or resale of the inventory. Customers Alliance has over 4,000 customers shipping to over 35,000 storefronts and service over 2,000 independent music and video retailers. It conducts business with most of the leading retailers of entertainment products and services around the world. Alliance serves a customer base that is divided into categories including retailers, direct marketers, Internet-based resellers, independent dealers, product category specialists and other distributors. Management believes that many of its customers are heavily dependent on Alliance as a partner with the necessary systems, capital, inventory availability, and distribution and facilities in place to provide fulfillment and other services. Alliance tries to reduce our exposure to the impact of business fluctuations by maintaining a balance in the customer categories we serve. In most cases Alliance conducts business with our customers under our general terms and conditions, without minimum purchase requirements. It also has resale contracts with some of its reseller customers that are terminable at will after a reasonable notice period and have no minimum purchase requirements. Alliance typically ships products on the same day it receives and accepts customers

Table of Contents 
 purchase orders. Unless otherwise requested, substantially all of Alliance s products are delivered by common freight carriers. Backlog is usually not material to its business because orders are generally filled shortly after acceptance. Alliance has specific agreements in place with certain suppliers and resellers in which it provides supply chain management services such as order management, technical support, call center services, forward and reverse logistics management, and procurement management services. These agreements generally may be terminated by either party without cause following reasonable notice. For the year ended June 30, 2022, Alliance s top five customers represented approximately 47 of its consolidated revenue. Alliance s top customer represented 19 of its consolidated net sales. None of the Company s customer contracts exceed a one-year term, with most contracts having auto-renewal clauses. Our Business is Affected by Seasonality Alliance experiences some seasonal fluctuation in demand in our business. For instance, Alliance typically sees lower demand, particularly in Europe, in the summer months. The Company also normally sees an increase in demand in the September-to-December period, driven primarily by pre-holiday impacts on stocking levels in the retail channel for its North American business. How We Manage Our Inventory Alliance strives to maintain sufficient quantities of product inventories to achieve optimum order fill rates. Alliance s business, like that of other distributors, is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be impacted adversely by suppliers price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising the inventory. It is the policy of many suppliers to offer distributors limited protection from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or a supplier s price reductions. When protection is offered, the distributor may be restricted to a designated period of time in which products may be returned for credit or exchanged for other products or during which price protection credits may be claimed. Alliance continually takes various actions, including monitoring inventory levels and controlling the timing of purchases, to maximize its protection under supplier programs and reduce inventory risk. However, no assurance can be given that current protective terms and conditions will continue or that they will adequately protect Alliance against declines in inventory value, or that they will not be revised in such a manner as to adversely impact Alliance s ability to obtain price protection. Alliance is subject to the risk that inventory values may decline, and supplier agreements may not adequately cover the decline in values. Alliance manages these risks through pricing and continual monitoring of existing inventory levels relative to customer demand, reflecting its forecasts of future demand and market conditions. On an ongoing basis, Alliance reduces inventory values for excess and obsolescence to assist in the liquidation of impacted inventories. Music CD s and Video Movies are 100 returnable back to Alliance s suppliers. Products that have exclusive distributions for Amped and Distribution Solutions are not owned by Alliance and are treated as consignment as for ownership and title. Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due, in part, to differences in actual demand from that forecasted when orders were placed, the addition of new suppliers or new product lines with current suppliers, expansion into new product areas and strategic purchases of inventory. In addition, payment terms with inventory suppliers may vary from time to time and could result in fewer inventories being financed by suppliers and a greater amount of inventory being financed by our own capital. Our payment patterns can be influenced by incentives, such as early pay discounts offered by suppliers. Sales and Marketing Alliance s product management and marketing groups help create demand for Alliance s suppliers products and services, enable the launch of new products, and facilitate customer contact. Our marketing programs are tailored to meet specific supplier and customer needs. These needs are met through a wide offering of services by our in-house marketing organization, including advertising, market research, online marketing, retail programs, sales promotions, training, and solutions marketing. In addition, Alliance creates and utilizes specialized channel marketing communities to deliver focused resources and business building support to solution providers.

 For its DTC division, the Company deploys performance marketing strategies through digital and offline channels to drive additional traffic and transactions from high-intent prospective customers. To increase the efficiency of its performance marketing initiatives, the Company utilizes a Customer Relationship management platform, which provides further opportunities to personalize marketing campaigns and target advertising to specific market segments. Alliance complements its brand and performance marketing with nurture initiatives through email and outbound communications to ensure the Company retains high-value customers, increases brand loyalty, and drives recurring transactions. The Company s marketing strategy includes brand performance, and viral marketing. Brand marketing, which may also include the Company s presence on social media platforms, increases awareness among potential customers, helping them understand the benefits of using Alliance s platforms. In addition to brand, and performance marketing, Alliance engages in traditional public relations and communications activities, such as trade show participation, to strengthen its brand and enable it to be less reliant on performance marketing, reducing the Company s customer acquisition costs. The Company s communications team works across press and policy channels to share timely and important news about the Company. They also oversee the execution of a consumer, product, corporate, and policy communications plan that supports Alliance s brand strategy. Competition Alliance faces competition from a variety of competitors, including some of our own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers, and internet-based businesses. We are a leading company in the sale and marketing of physical media entertainment products, including vinyl, gaming, DVDs, CD s and consumer products and toys offerings, and operate in the competitive e-commerce business environment. We compete with several smaller physical media companies in our product categories, as well as with many larger e-commerce companies in the United States and internationally. In addition, we compete with entertainment companies that digitally download and stream their products. Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer product preferences and on the quality and play value of our physical media products and experiences. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing. Many of the major entertainment and gaming companies are part of large, diversified companies with a variety of other operations. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase entertainment revenues and streaming placement. In addition, the resources of the major entertainment producers may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including media content, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our products or pay more for third party content, any of which could harm our business. The changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content, such as the growing number of streaming platform options, continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and e-commerce offerings. In the future, the Company may face increased competition through the emergence of new competitors or business models. Some of Alliance s competitors may have access to significant financial resources, greater name recognition and well-established client bases in their target customer segments, differentiated business models, technology and other capabilities, or a differentiated geographic coverage, which may make it more difficult for Alliance to attract new customers. Intellectual Property Alliance s intellectual property is an important component of its business. The Company relies on a combination of domain names, trademarks, copyright, know-how and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect its intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, Alliance has no active patents or patent applications, but intends to pursue patent protection to the extent it believes it would be beneficial and cost effective. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned 32 U.S. registered or pending trademarks and registered or pending trademarks in two other jurisdictions. Alliance also owns over 300 domain names including www.deepdiscount.com, www.aent.com, www.cokem.com, www.importcds.com, www.ds.aent.com, and www.ampeddistribution.com.

 The Company relies on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain its competitive advantage. Alliance seeks to protect its trade secrets and confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, third parties, and others who may have access to the Company s proprietary information. Alliance also requires key employees to sign invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment and restrict unauthorized access to the Company s proprietary technology. In addition, Alliance has developed proprietary, AI-driven software that is protected through a combination of copyright and trade secrets. Notwithstanding the Company s efforts to protect its intellectual property, there can be no assurance the measures taken will be effective or that its intellectual property will provide any competitive advantage. Alliance can provide no assurance that any patents will be issued from its pending applications or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect its proprietary technology. The Company s intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, Alliance may be unable to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights in certain jurisdictions. In addition, while the Company has confidence in the measures it takes to protect and preserve its trade secrets, it cannot guarantee these measures will not be circumvented, or that all applicable parties have executed confidentiality or invention assignment agreements. In addition, such agreements can be breached, and may not have adequate remedies should any such breach occur. Accordingly, Alliance s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, Alliance had approximately 786 employees on its payroll and approximately 410 workers hired through staffing agencies throughout the U.S. and internationally. As of June 30, 2022, Alliance had approximately 797 employees on its payroll and approximately 332 workers hired through staffing agencies throughout the U.S. and internationally. None of Alliance s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and Alliance believes it has a good relationship with its employees. Employees Demographics. With respect to global demographics, approximately 47 of the Company s payroll employees are female and 53 are male. Talent Turnover. With a focus on talent acquisition, the leadership team seeks out the most qualified candidates for open roles and endeavors to keep them at Alliance. Alliance has a robust program for seeking out those candidates, which ranges from sourcing through talent applications, reviewing direct applicants and using internal referrals to fill roles. Additionally, Alliance strives to promote internally when possible. Alliance s program resulted in an annualized turnover rate of 15 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Compensation Practice Pay Equality. As Alliance evolves and expands operations, Human Resources, in partnership with the leadership team, will continue to evaluate the existing workforce to ensure that best practices are maintained across the entire team without risk of inequality. Pay structures for hourly employees are reviewed annually and for all other employees, compensation is benchmarked according to the position when a vacancy becomes available. This ensures best practices in a competitive market and, as part of that review, compensation will be realigned where appropriate for existing employees and new hires. Health, Safety Welfare. Alliance acted quickly to respond to safety protocols as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of its team members. To support team members, Alliance provided temporary pay increases to certain employees, offered remote work where possible, purchased additional sanitation supplies and increased personal protective materials provided to staff. Regulatory Compliance The Company s overall business approach and strategy includes rigorous attention to regulatory compliance, as its operations are subject to regulations in the following principal areas, across a wide variety of jurisdictions. Alliance s business is subject to a wide 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 array of laws, regulations, and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where we operate. Alliance has a buying office in the UK and operates under the name Fulfillment Express. Fulfillment Express sources music from the UK music suppliers that is then transferred (exported from the United Kingdom) to Kentucky where that music product is prepared to sell in the US market. Fulfillment Express makes no sales of any kind, it only is a buying office. The regulatory environment in each market is often complex, evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations are inconsistent, ambiguous and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to an innovative hospitality provider such as Alliance, which often makes their application to its business uncertain. For additional information regarding the laws and regulations that affect the Company s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Privacy and Data Protection Regulation In processing purchase transactions and information about customers, the Company receives and stores a large volume of personally identifiable data. The collection, storage, processing, transfer, use, disclosure and protection of this information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, such as the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, as well as privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various U.S. states and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act PIPEDA ), and the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act. Alliance incorporates a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data within the Company s platforms and business services, including personally identifiable data pertaining to guests and employees, and Alliance is engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and considering additional steps to maintain compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, GDPR, PIPEDA, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and the UK Data Protection Act. Employment Laws The Company is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration and workplace safety and health. Other Regulation Alliance s business is subject to various other laws and regulations, involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection, online messaging, advertising, and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries or persons. As the Company expands into additional markets, it will be subject to additional laws and regulations.

 executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) of 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 250 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equals or exceeds 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates equals or exceeds 700 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter. Item 1A. Risk Factors. An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this annual report before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risk Factor Summary The following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk contained below. If Alliance fails to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the music, video, gaming, and entertainment industry, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, its business could be harmed. If Alliance does not successfully optimize and operate its fulfillment network, its business could be harmed. The markets in which Alliance participates are competitive, and if Alliance does not compete effectively, its operating results could be harmed. Alliance may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in its acquisitions or joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. Alliance s expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects it to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks. Alliance s international operations expose it to a number of risks. Alliance s business will suffer if it is not successful in developing and expanding its partner brands across its consumer base. Consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors. An inability to develop, introduce and ship planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage Alliance s business. If Alliance is unable to navigate through global supply chain challenges, its business may be harmed. If Alliance is unable to adapt its business to the continued shift to ecommerce, its business may be harmed. The concentration of Alliance s retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of its major customers could have a significant impact on it.

 Alliance s business, including its costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and logistics, and the loss of any of its key suppliers or service providers could negatively impact its business. Alliance faces significant inventory risk. If Alliance s third-party suppliers labels, studios, and publishers do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. Shipping is a critical part of Alliance s business and any changes in its shipping arrangements or any interruptions in shipping could adversely affect our operating results. Alliance is subject to risks related to online payment methods, including third-party payment processing-related risks. Alliance relies on third-party suppliers, labels, studios, publishers, suppliers, retail and ecommerce partners and other vendors, and they may not continue to produce products or provide services that are consistent with Alliance s standards or applicable regulatory requirements, which could harm its brand, cause consumer dissatisfaction, and require it to find alternative suppliers of its products or services. Alliance s business may be harmed if it is unable to protect its critical intellectual property rights. Failure to successfully operate Alliance s information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt its business or reduce its sales or profitability. If Alliance s electronic data is compromised its business could be significantly harmed. Alliance s quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in its business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact Alliance s reported financial performance. Alliance s indebtedness may limit its availability of cash, cause it to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take certain other actions. Covenants and events of default in Alliance s revolving credit facility could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity. If Alliance were unable to obtain or service its other external financings, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, its business would be harmed. Alliance faces additional tax liabilities and collection obligations. Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in its geographic operating results, may impact its effective tax rate. Alliance is subject to various government regulations, violation of which could subject it to sanctions or otherwise harm its business. In addition, Alliance could be the subject of future product liability suits or merchandise recalls, which could harm its business. Alliance s entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Alliance is involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense. Concentration of ownership among Alliance s executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions. Alliance has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to non-financial covenant breach and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future. Failure to remediate the material weakness or failure to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, it may adversely affect our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results, and may adversely affect investor confidence and business operations. A significant portion of Alliance s total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market beginning on August 11, 2023. This could cause the market price of the Class A common stock to drop significantly, even if Alliance s business is doing well. The adverse impact of inflation and higher interest rates on Alliance. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the music, video, gaming, and entertainment industry, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, our business could be harmed. The music, video, gaming, and entertainment industry continues to experience frequent change driven by technological development, including developments with respect to the formats through which music, films, television programming, games, and other content are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings, the 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. For example, consumers are increasingly accessing television, film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+ and Apple TV+. Additionally, consumers access music content through Apple Music, Pandora, Amazon Music, Spotify and other providers. Video game services can be accessed through Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Now, GeForce, Steam, Stadia, xCloud, Shadow, Luna, and Switch Online. Some entertainment offerings have gone direct to streaming channels and not produced a physical content format. Direct release to streaming channels is likely to continue. Technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of music and entertainment offerings and have caused and could in the future cause a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner. The overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, including from merchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed. If we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network, our business could be harmed. If we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, and harm our business in other ways. As we continue to add fulfillment or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network could result in lost sales from under inventory positions or extra costs of holding excess inventory or write downs on inventory. Due to tight labor markets, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers or have to increase wages to attract more employees. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We face competition. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our revenues, market share and profitability could decline. Our businesses are rapidly evolving and competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omni-channel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, web and infrastructure computing services, and transportation and logistics services, and across geographies, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition. They may also secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The music, video, gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small distributors, and sellers of vinyl records, CD s, DVD s, video games and other entertainment and consumer products. In addition, we compete with companies that are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories, including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. Competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits. Disruptions in Alliance s supply chain have increased product expenditures and could result in an adverse impact on results of operations. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, Alliance s top five suppliers represent approximately 48 of product expenditures. For the year ended June 30, 2022, Alliance s top five suppliers represented approximately 40 of all of Alliance s product expenditures as compared to approximately 25 of product expenditures for previous fiscal year. The occurrence of one or more natural or human induced disasters, including pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the COVID-19 pandemic; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest attacks in a country in which Alliance s suppliers are located; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of Alliance s logistics or supply chain network. For example, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the operations of Alliance and its suppliers and customers. Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed, which has challenged Alliance s ability to anticipate and/or procure product to maintain inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher product inventory cost positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to Alliance s distribution centers, branches or customers, and similar results may occur in the future. Even when Alliance is able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require Alliance to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact Alliance s profitability and financial condition. Any of these circumstances could impair Alliance s ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties or damage to Alliance s reputation. Any such increased product costs from supplier disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance. Inflation could cause Alliance s product costs and operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings. Market variables, such as inflation of product costs from suppliers, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, have and may continue to increase potentially causing Alliance to be unable to efficiently manage its product costs and operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable it to leverage its revenue growth into higher net earnings. In addition, Alliance s inability to pass on such increases in product costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause Alliance s operating and administrative expenses to grow, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings. Weakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Alliance s customers could negatively impact Alliance s sales growth and results of operations. Economic, political and industry trends affect Alliance s business environments. Alliance serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Alliance s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank interest rate fluctuations, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Alliance s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close stores, delay purchases, reduce wholesale purchasing levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own retail and wholesale products or services.

 Any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Alliance or impair the ability of Alliance s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Alliance s selling prices and terms of sale. Our expansion places a strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources. We are rapidly and significantly expanding operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in our acquisitions or joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, such as our acquisition of COKeM in September 2020. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies of the company. We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business. Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks. We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our customers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.

 Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers demands; our ability to retain and expand our network of customers; our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; variations in the mix of products and services we sell; variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; the extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; factors affecting our reputation or brand image; the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies; the extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items; the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; terrorist attacks and armed hostilities; supply chain issues either in chip shortages; and long lead time in the manufacturing vinyl LP s. 
 Our international operations expose us to a number of risks. Our international activities are insignificant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: local economic and political conditions; government regulation and compliance requirements (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership; restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;

 limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. 
 As international physical, e-commerce, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth. Our business will suffer if we are not successful in developing and expanding our partner brands across our consumer base. Our strategy is to focus and expand, larger global brands with an emphasis on developing and expanding those of our key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential, across our customer base. As we concentrate our efforts on more brands, we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. This focus means that our success depends disproportionately on our and our new partners ability to successfully develop these new brands across our consumer base and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to acquire, build, invest in and develop our competencies in music, movies, gaming, consumer products and entertainment products. Acquiring, developing, investing in and growing these competencies has required significant effort, time and money, with no assurance of success. The success of our brand blueprint strategy also requires significant alignment and integration among our business segments. If we are unable to successfully develop, maintain and expand key partner brands across our brand blueprint, our business performance will suffer. Consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors. The interests of families, individuals, fans and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography. To be successful, we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment, products and play patterns which will capture consumers interests and imagination, and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever-increasing utilization of technology, social media and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, our products and entertainment offerings can have short consumer life cycles. Consumer acceptance of our or our partners entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews, promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs, music, video games, and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that television programs and films, video games, video movies we distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that films, video games, video movies we distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well in our distribution channels.

 If we devote time and resources to distributing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline, and our business performance may be harmed. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings will be reduced. An inability to develop, introduce and ship planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business. In acquiring new products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are distributing, providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued. If we are unable to navigate through global supply chain challenges, our business may be harmed. In 2021 and continuing through 2022, we have faced global supply chain challenges with the production and delivery of some products being delayed due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions. We have experienced increases in material costs and shortages for some of our products, due in part to higher wages being paid due to labor shortages in China and Vietnam, as well as periodic and unpredictable manufacturing shut-downs due to COVID-19. While we have taken actions to lessen the impact of these supply chain challenges, such as through the use of alternative ports and air freight, such actions have resulted in higher costs and there can be no assurance that the actions taken will continue to be effective. We have also increased prices in some cases to help offset increased costs. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future and we cannot assure that price increases we have already taken will offset the entirety of additional costs we have incurred and may incur in the future to mitigate the supply chain disruption. Further, if we are unable to negotiate favorable carrier agreements, deliver products on time or otherwise satisfy demand for our products, our business may be harmed. If we are unable to adapt our business to the continued shift to ecommerce, our business may be harmed. Ecommerce sales continue to grow in overall sales as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to through in-store shopping due to the continued transition to ecommerce accelerated by the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ecommerce sales have resulted in retailers holding less inventory, which has caused us to adjust our supply chain. This supply chain is further strained by customers desiring faster delivery at reduced costs. Additionally, if our technology and systems used to support ecommerce order processing are not effective, our ability to deliver products on time on a cost-effective basis may be adversely affected. Failure to continue to adapt our systems and supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business. The concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us. For the year ended June 30, 2022 and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, our top customer generated over 10 of net sales. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our top customer accounted for approximately 19 of our total net sales, purchased a mix of products comprised of 34 games, 46 music, and 20 movies. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our top customer accounted for 24 of our total net sales, purchased a mix of products comprised of 41 games, 39 music, and 20 movies. Due to our customer concentration, if our top customer were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, change their purchasing patterns, impose unexpected fees on us, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, our business may be harmed.

 Our customers do not make binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries, and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and logistics, and the loss of any of our key suppliers or service providers could negatively impact our business. All of the products we offer are manufactured by third-party labels, studios, publishers, and suppliers, and as a result we may be subject to price fluctuations or demand disruptions. Our operating results would be negatively impacted by increases in the costs of the products we offer, and we have no guarantees that costs will not rise. In addition, as we expand into new categories and product types, we expect that we may not have strong purchasing power in these new areas, which could lead to higher costs than we have historically seen in our current categories. We may not be able to pass increased costs on to consumers, which could adversely affect our operating results. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the materials used in the manufacture of the products we offer, we and the vendors that we work with might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. In addition, products, and merchandise we receive from manufacturers and suppliers may not be of sufficient quality or free from damage, or such products may be damaged during shipping, while stored in our warehouse fulfillment centers or with third-party ecommerce or retail customers or when returned by consumers. We may incur additional expenses and our reputation could be harmed if consumers and potential consumers believe that our products do not meet their expectations, are not properly labeled or are damaged. We purchase significant amounts from a limited number of suppliers with limited supply capabilities. There can be no assurance that our current suppliers will be able to accommodate our anticipated growth or continue to supply current quantities at preferential prices. An inability of our existing suppliers to provide products in a timely or cost-effective manner could impair our growth and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We generally do not maintain long-term supply contracts with any of our suppliers and any of our suppliers could discontinue selling to us at any time. The loss of any of our other significant suppliers, or the discontinuance of any preferential pricing or exclusive incentives they currently offer to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We continually seek to expand our base of product suppliers, especially as we identify new markets. We also require our new and existing suppliers to meet our ethical and business partner standards. Suppliers may also have to meet governmental and industry standards and any relevant standards required by our consumers, which may require additional investment and time on behalf of suppliers and us. If any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent, ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or if any environmental, economic or other outside factors impact their operations. If we are unable to identify or enter into distribution relationships with new suppliers or to replace the loss of any of our existing suppliers, we may experience a competitive disadvantage, our business may be disrupted and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Our principal suppliers currently provide us with certain incentives such as extended payment terms, volume purchasing, trade discounts, cooperative advertising and market development funds. A reduction or discontinuance of these incentives would increase our costs and could reduce our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. Similarly, if one or more of our suppliers were to offer these incentives, including preferential pricing, to our competitors, our competitive advantage would be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We face significant inventory risk. In addition to risks described elsewhere relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns,

 changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment, and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. If our inventory forecasting and production planning processes result in higher inventory levels exceeding the levels demanded by customers or should our customers decrease their orders with us, our operating results could be adversely affected due to costs of carrying the inventory and additional inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. If our third-party suppliers labels, studios, and publishers do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. Our reputation and our consumers willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our suppliers labels, studios, publishers, and other suppliers, and retail partners compliance with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their businesses. We do not exercise control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and retail partners and cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical and lawful business practices. If our suppliers, manufacturers, or retail partners fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical standards, our reputation and brand image could be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary liability, and additional costs that would harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Shipping is a critical part of our business and any changes in our shipping arrangements or any interruptions in shipping could adversely affect our operating results. We primarily rely on two major vendors for our shipping requirements. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these two vendors or one of the two experiences performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and our consumer or retail partner experience. Shipping vendors may also impose shipping surcharges from time to time. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship products to consumers and retailers may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, trade embargoes, customs and tax requirements and similar factors. For example, strikes at major international shipping ports have in the past impacted our supply of inventory from our third-party labels, studios, publishers, and suppliers, and the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China has and may in the future lead to increased tariffs, the revocation of current tariff exclusions for certain of our products, which may restrict the flow of the goods from China to the United States. We are also subject to risks of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping vendors. If our products are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during the delivery process, our consumers could become dissatisfied and cease shopping on our site or retailer or third-party ecommerce sites, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. We are subject to risks related to online payment methods, including third-party payment processing-related risks. We currently accept payments using a variety of methods, including checks, ACH, wire transfers, credit card, debit card, PayPal, and gift cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, fraud, and other risks. We also rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, and for certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and affect ability to achieve or maintain profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we (or a third-party processing payment card transactions on our behalf) suffer a security breach affecting payment card information, we may have to pay onerous and significant fines, penalties and assessments arising out of the major card brands rules and regulations, contractual indemnifications or liability contained in merchant agreements and similar contracts, and we may lose our ability to accept payment cards for payment for our goods and services, which could materially impact our operations and financial performance.

 Furthermore, as our business changes, we may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. As we offer new payment options to consumers, including by way of integrating emerging mobile and other payment methods, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. We also occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent data and we may ultimately be held liable for the unauthorized use of a cardholder s card number in an illegal activity and be required by card issuers to pay charge-back fees. Charge-backs result not only in our loss of fees earned with respect to the payment, but also leave us liable for the underlying money transfer amount. If our charge-back rate becomes excessive, card associations also may require us to pay fines or refuse to process our transactions. To mitigate credit card fraud, we use Kount to score all credit card orders for risk of fraud. In addition, we may be subject to additional fraud risk if third-party service providers or our employees fraudulently use consumer information for their own gain or facilitate the fraudulent use of such information. Overall, we may have little recourse if we process a criminally fraudulent transaction. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. We rely on third-party suppliers, labels, studios, publishers, suppliers, retail and ecommerce partners and other vendors, and they may not continue to produce products or provide services that are consistent with our standards or applicable regulatory requirements, which could harm our brand, cause consumer dissatisfaction, and require us to find alternative suppliers of our products or services. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We use multiple third-party suppliers and labels, studios, publishers, suppliers based primarily in the United States, China and Mexico and other countries to a lesser extent, to manufacture and supply all of the products we offer and sell. We engage many of our third-party suppliers and labels, studios, publishers, suppliers on a purchase order basis and in most cases are not party to long-term contracts with them. The ability and willingness of these third parties to supply and manufacture the products we offer, and sell may be affected by competing orders placed by other companies and the demands of those companies. If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace a significant number of existing suppliers or manufacturers, there can be no assurance that additional supply and manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer will allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Furthermore, our reliance on suppliers and manufacturers outside of the United States, the number of third parties with whom we transact and the number of jurisdictions to which we sell complicates our efforts to comply with customs duties and excise taxes; any failure to comply could adversely affect our business. In addition, quality control problems, such as the use of materials and delivery of products that do not meet our quality control standards and specifications or comply with applicable laws or regulations, could harm our business. Quality control problems could result in regulatory action, such as restrictions on importation, products of inferior quality or product stock outages or shortages, harming our sales and creating inventory write-downs for unusable products. We have also outsourced minute portions of our fulfillment process, as well as certain technology-related functions, to third-party service providers. Specifically, we are dependent on third-party vendors for credit card processing, and we use third-party hosting and networking providers to host our sites. The failure of one or more of these entities to provide the expected services on a timely basis, or at all, or at the prices we expect, or the costs and disruption incurred in changing these outsourced functions to being performed under our management and direct control or that of a third party, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are party to short-term contracts with some of our retail and ecommerce partners, and upon expiration of these existing agreements, we may not be able to renegotiate the terms on a commercially reasonable basis, or at all.

 Further, our third-party labels, studios, publishers, suppliers and retail and ecommerce partners may: have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; take actions contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives; be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under relevant purchase orders, including obligations to meet our production deadlines, quality standards, pricing guidelines and product specifications, and to comply with applicable regulations, including those regarding the safety and quality of products; have financial difficulties; encounter raw material or labor shortages; encounter increases in raw material or labor costs which may affect our procurement costs; encounter difficulties with proper payment of custom duties or excise taxes; disclose our confidential information or intellectual property to competitors or third parties; engage in activities or employ practices that may harm our reputation; and work with, be acquired by, or come under control of, our competitors. 
 The maturity of our Credit Facility has raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our Credit Facility with Bank of America has a maturity date of September 29, 2023, and we have been unable to maintain a certain minimum fixed charged ratio to comply with the financial covenants associated as defined in the Credit Facility. Without generating sufficient cash flow from operations, access to other sources of liquidity or an extension of the existing credit facility, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, meaning that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. If we need to seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. Alliance s existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to operate its business. On June 30, 2022, the credit line with Bank of America was amended for the current period which ends September 29, 2023 and increased from 175 million to 225 million with a variable annual interest rate equal to the higher of the Prime rate, Federal Funds rate plus .5 or Bank of America SOFR rate plus 2.11 (Libor rate plus 2 is the prior agreement). As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate was 6.41 (SOFR 4.30 plus a spread of 2.11 ). As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate was 2.25 (Libor .25 plus a spread of 2 with borrowing above the contracted Libor at 4.25 (Base Rate 3.25 plus a spread of 1 ). The weighted average interest rate on the revolver for six months ended December 31, 2022, and year ended June 30, 2022 was 6.90 and 2.76 , respectively. All assets (with certain capitalized lease exceptions) and interest in assets of the Company are pledged as collateral under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2017, by and among Alliance, Bank of America, N.A. and the other parties thereto, as amended, restated, supplemented, included or otherwise modified in writing from time to time (the Credit Facility ). In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply. Failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default. An event of default, if not cured or waived, would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility. Availability under the Credit Facility is limited by the Company s borrowing base calculation, as defined in the Credit Facility. In addition, there is a commitment fee of 0.25 for unused credit line with fees for year ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 of 100 thousand and 300 thousand, respectively. Availability at December 31, 2022, was 48.3 million with an outstanding revolver balance of 176.7 million. Availability on December 31, 2021 was 49.3 million with an outstanding revolver balance of 125.7 million.

December 31, June 30, in thousands) 2022 2022 Bank of America Revolving Credit Facility 176,740 136,176 Less: Deferred Finance Costs (125) (208) Revolving Credit, Net 176,615 135,968 Alliance s outstanding indebtedness, including any additional indebtedness beyond our borrowings from Bank of America, combined with its other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including: requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest and principal, reducing money available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, international expansion, new product development, new enterprise relationships and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions; subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options. 
 We intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our then existing cash and cash equivalents. However, we may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due under the Credit Facility or any other debt instruments. Failure to make payments or comply with other covenants under our existing credit facility or such other debt instruments could result in an event of default and acceleration of amounts due, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Covenants and events of default under Alliance s Credit Facility could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity. Alliance s Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, Alliance obtained a waiver for non-compliance with one non-financial covenant related to its delivery of the monthly unaudited financial statements and compliance certificates for the periods pertaining to June 30, 2022, July 31, 2022, and August 31, 2022. This non-compliance resulted in events of default under the Credit Facility. As a result of this non-compliance as of the balance sheet date and periods thereafter, the Company has classified the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility Net of 135,968 as a current liability as of June 30, 2022. The Company expects that it will comply with this non-financial covenant for a period of at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. In addition, as further described in Note 17 to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company determined that it incorrectly classified the revolving credit facility, net, as a non-current liability instead of as a current liability on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The Company determined that such financial statements were materially misstated and should be restated. As disclosed in Note 9 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, during the second fiscal ended December 31, 2022, the Company failed to meet the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant requirement. The Company is in negotiations with its lender to obtain a waiver for non-compliance. The Company also obtained a waiver for non-compliance with one non-financial covenant related to its delivery of the monthly unaudited financial statements and compliance certificates for the periods pertaining to June 30, 2022, July 31, 2022, and August 31, 2022. We cannot provide any assurance that our lender would provide us with a waiver should we not be in compliance in the future. A failure to maintain compliance along with our lender not agreeing to a waiver for the non-compliance would cause the outstanding borrowings to be in default and payable on demand which would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to continue as a going concern. A breach of the covenants under the Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Facility could permit the lenders under

 the Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Credit Facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lender accelerates the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. You should read our more detailed descriptions of the Credit Facility set forth in this annual report and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the documents themselves which are also filed as exhibits to this annual report, for further information about these covenants. Government efforts to combat inflation, along with other interest rate pressures arising from an inflationary economic environment, could lead to us to incur even higher interest rates and financing costs. Inflation has risen on a global basis, the United States has been experiencing historically high levels of inflation, and government entities have taken various actions to combat inflation, such as raising interest rate benchmarks. Government entities may continue their efforts, or implement additional efforts, to combat inflation, which could include among other things continuing to raise interest rate benchmarks and/or maintaining interest rate benchmarks at elevated levels. Such government efforts, along with other interest rate pressures arising from an inflationary economic environment, could lead to us to incur even higher interest rates and financing costs on our credit line with Bank of America and have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring, and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world. The increasing prevalence of remote work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely opens up more employment opportunities. The impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed. Our future success will depend on the leadership of our key executives such as Mr. Bruce Ogilvie, our Executive Chairman, and Mr. Jeff Walker, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Ogilvie and Mr. Walker are executives of other companies, including GameFly Holdings, Inc. GameFly is a customer of Alliance. Alliance uses GameFly s Lakewood, California warehouse to ship and fulfill products for Alliance s customers. A Conflict of interest may arise with respect to their allocation of business time and such conflicts may not be resolved in Alliance s favor. Our loss of key management or other employees, inability to drive success through our new leaders, or our inability to retain or hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our diverse and changing business, could significantly harm our business. If we fail to develop diverse top talent, we may be unable to compete, and our business may be harmed. To compete successfully, we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people. We promote a diverse and inclusive work environment. To that end, we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented, diverse employees, who we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business. Competition for diverse talent is intense. We cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business. Alliance has engaged in transactions with related parties, and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alliance has entered into transactions with related parties, including our two principal stockholders. We have entered into transactions with companies owned by Bruce Ogilvie and Jeffrey Walker, including Gamefly Holdings, LLC. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Alliance made sales of new release movies, video games, and video game consoles to GameFly Holdings LLC in the amount of 2.3 million and 4.8 million respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Alliance made sales of new release movies, video games, and video game consoles to GameFly Holdings LLC in the amount of 7.1 million, 5.3 million, and 2.5 million, respectively. GameFly, a customer of Alliance, is equally owned by Bruce Ogilvie and Jeff Walker, the two shareholders of Alliance. Alliance believes the amounts payable to GameFly are at fair market value. Although the agreement between Alliance and GameFly can be terminated by either party at any time, given Mr. Ogilvie s and Mr. Walker s

 positions with Alliance as Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. We may in the future enter into additional transactions with entities in which majority shareholders, executive officers and members of our board of directors and other related parties hold ownership interests. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. Transactions with such related parties present potential for conflicts of interest, as the interests of the third-party owned related entity and its shareholders may not align with the interests of our stockholders with respect to the negotiation of, and certain other matters. For example, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions regarding the structure and terms of the GameFly contract, contractual remedies, events of default and dealings with customers. Pursuant to our related party transactions policy, all additional material related party transactions that we enter into require either (i) the unanimous consent of our audit committee or (ii) the approval of a majority of the members of our board of directors. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions . Nevertheless, we may have achieved more favorable terms if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties and these transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations or may result in government enforcement actions or other litigation. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position. Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability. We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other cybersecurity breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems or third-party hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability. If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed. We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the United States and in the cloud. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, hacktivists and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks

 could also include supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material. The global coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases, or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could substantially harm our business. The global outbreak of the coronavirus which continues to adversely impact global populations, and any other variants or outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases or other adverse public health conditions in markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, licensors, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our business, revenues and profitability. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in, disruptions and damage to our business, caused by a number of factors: difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to ongoing port capacity, and labor, shipping container and truck transportation shortages, resulting in higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products, which can result in delayed sales and in some cases result in lost sales. disruptions in supply of products, due to closures or reductions in operations at third-party manufacturing facilities across several geographies including, but not limited to, China, Vietnam, and the United States; adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers, resulting from retail store closures, limited reopening of retail stores and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce channels to supply additional products; fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of e-commerce platforms in those markets; limited production of live-action scripted and unscripted entertainment content due to the hard stop and soft reopening of production studios; delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases of entertainment content both internally and by our partners; increases in entertainment production costs due to measures required to minimize COVID-19 risks; and challenges of working remotely. 
 We have reopened our offices, providing employees flexibility in their return to the office by working partially in the office and partially remote. We have taken measures to safely bring additional workers back to the office, including a return to fully remote work when variants emerge which increase infection rates significantly in areas where we do business. The transition back from fully remote work to partial remote and partial in person may be difficult for some employees. We are actively soliciting feedback and making modifications to provide our employees with a productive and safe environment, and plan to continue to monitor employee efficiency, satisfaction, and morale as we continue to transition. There can be no assurance that employees will not have some disruption in their work due to the transition. Changes in flexible working arrangements could impact employee retention, employees productivity and morale, strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks. Additionally, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks. The impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain, and while vaccines are being rolled out, it is still difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations. If our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions due to the coronavirus or other similar outbreaks, we believe our business could be substantially harmed.

 Adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability. Various economic conditions in the markets we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages, slowdowns and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Inflation, such as what consumers in the U.S. and other economies are experiencing, can cause significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer. Weakened economic conditions, higher interest rates, lowered employment levels or recessions may also significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could significantly harm our revenues and profitability. Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, due to inflation or otherwise, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation and shipping costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business. Changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions could harm our business and financial performance. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Reductions in stimulus payments provided to consumers, high inflation and rising interest rates on credit cards could impact discretionary spending. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit and financial markets in the U.S. and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability. Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business. Sales of our music, video movies, video games and other entertainment products are seasonal, with an increase of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December for the holiday season. This seasonality for our consumer products business has increased over time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Further, ecommerce continues to grow significantly and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. While these techniques reduce a retailer s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it. The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to procure and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. These risks have been exacerbated in 2021 and 2022 due to the global supply chain challenges we have faced due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions.

 Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of music, television, film, gaming content releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market, and more recently, the timing of release dates has been affected by the pandemic. This seasonal pattern of our business requires significant use of working capital, mainly to purchase inventory during the months prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. As a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays or other supply chain challenges that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season. If we incurred any significant impairment charges, our net earnings would be reduced. Declines in the profitability of acquired brands or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Similarly, declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our net earnings. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our small global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars. Our indebtedness may limit our availability of cash, cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take certain other actions. We operate the business with an asset-based line of credit to fund working capital to support our Accounts Receivables and our Inventory purchases. Our debt service obligations under such indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, our indebtedness could: make it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments; require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes; make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes and result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest; require that materially adverse terms, conditions, or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and

 jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn. 
 If we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the second and third quarters of each year, we rely on a revolving credit agreement which provides for a 225,000,000 committed revolving asset-based loan Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating, and strategic flexibility. Additionally, as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company received a waiver from the lender for non-compliance with certain non-financial covenants as of June 30, 2022, July 31, 2022, and August 31, 2022. Non-compliance with our debt covenants in the future could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under the Credit Facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations. Alliance recently failed to meet the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility, being notified on February 8, 2023 that a fixed charge coverage ratio has been recently breached, with the letter indicating that is subject to a deferred action by the lender. The Company is in negotiations with its lender to obtain a waiver for non-compliance. Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding. We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt, we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all. We face additional tax liabilities and collection obligations. Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate. We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases, we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.

 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in United Kingdom tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units, and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the United Kingdom in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws, such as those being considered by the current United States administration and other jurisdictions in which we do business, or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates. In addition, we have been and may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results. We are subject to various government regulations, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or merchandise recalls, which could harm our business. We are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. Advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, such as the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union, and data protection laws in the United States and in a number of other counties. While we take all the steps, we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and, if we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future, we could be subject to fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm the reputation of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, employment, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition. We may face increased costs in achieving our sustainability goals and any failure to achieve our goals could result in reputational damage. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies. We also believe the long-term viability and health of our own operations and our supply chain, and the significant potential for environmental improvements, are critical to our business success. We have set key goals and objectives in this area as described in Item 1. Business. We devote significant resources and expenditures to help achieve these goals. It is possible that we will incur significant expense in trying to achieve these goals with no assurance that we will be successful. Additionally, our reputation could be damaged if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to the production and packaging of our products.

 Our entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a distributor of media content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. We are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense. As a larger multinational corporation, we are subject to regulatory investigations, risks related to internal controls, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us, claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties property or rights, or claims by former employees for employment related matters. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Alliance has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to a non-financial covenant breach and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate the material weakness or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, it may adversely affect our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results and may adversely affect investor confidence and business operations. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for the classification of the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility, Net and a related audit adjustment to properly reflect the outstanding balance as a current liability as of June 30, 2022 in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. In addition, as further described in Note 17 to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company determined that it incorrectly classified the revolving credit facility, net, as a non-current liability instead of as a current liability on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The Company determined that such financial statements were materially misstated and should be restated. As disclosed in Note 9 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, during the second fiscal ended December 31, 2022, the Company failed to meet the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant requirement. The Company is in negotiations with its lender to obtain a waiver for non-compliance. The Company also obtained a waiver for non-compliance with one non-financial covenant related to its delivery of the monthly unaudited financial statements and compliance certificates for the periods pertaining to June 30, 2022, July 31, 2022, and August 31, 2022. We cannot provide any assurance that our lender would provide us with a waiver should we not be in compliance in the future. A failure to maintain compliance along with our lender not agreeing to a waiver for the non-compliance would cause the outstanding borrowings to be in default and payable on demand which would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to continue as a going concern. Our management has concluded that this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is due to the fact that Alliance is a private company with limited resources and did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented to address the accounting and financial reporting requirements related to certain non-routine transactions, such as the accounting implications resulting from covenant violations. Our management is in the process of developing a remediation plan and is taking steps to remediate the material weakness. The material weakness will be considered remediated when our management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and our management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Our management will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plan and will make the changes it determines to be appropriate. Although we

 intend to complete this remediation process as quickly as practicable, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our initiatives may not prove to be successful in remediating the material weakness. Furthermore, we cannot assure that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting, our stock price may decline as a result and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Prior to the Business Combination, Adara had accounted for its outstanding warrants as a warrant liability and Alliance is required to determine the value warrant liability quarterly, which could have a material impact on Alliance s financial position and operating results. On April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (the SEC Statement ). Specifically, the SEC Statement focused on certain settlement terms and provisions related to certain tender offers following a business combination, which terms are similar to those contained in the warrant agreement governing our warrants. As a result, included on Adara s balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, contained in this annual report are derivative liabilities related to embedded features contained within our warrants. Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statements of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly based on factors which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material. Alliance is required to continue to recognize the changes in the fair value of the warrants from the prior period, if any, in its operating results for the current period, which could have a material impact on Alliance s financial position and operating results. We will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a public company, we will face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs, and expenses as a public company that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the PCAOB and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements will require Alliance to carry out activities Alliance has not done previously. For example, Alliance will create new board committees and adopt new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), Alliance could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect Alliance s reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with Alliance s status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on Alliance s board of directors or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting, and administrative activities. These increased costs will require Alliance to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.

 Alliance s failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could negatively impact its business. Alliance is currently not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, upon Alliance no longer qualifying as a smaller reporting company, Alliance will be required to provide s attestation on internal controls. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of Alliance as a privately held company. We may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements applicable to us after the Business Combination. If Alliance is not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, it may not be able to assess whether its internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject it to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of its securities. Since Alliance qualifies as an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act and takes advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, it could make Alliance s securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare Alliance s performance to the performance of other public companies. Alliance qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act i. As such, Alliance will be eligible for and intends to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, including (a) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (b) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (c) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. Alliance will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which it has total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more during such fiscal year (as indexed for inflation), (iii) the date on which it has issued more than 1 billion in non- convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) December 31, 2026. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as Alliance is an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Even after Alliance no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company, it may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow it to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. Moreover, smaller reporting companies may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in their Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Alliance does not expect to continue to qualify as an emerging growth company following its June 30, 2023 fiscal year end. Investors may find the Class A common stock less attractive because Alliance will rely on these exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and its price may be more volatile. Alliance s management has limited experience in operating a public company. Alliance s executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Alliance s management team may not successfully or effectively manage its transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of Alliance. Alliance may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for Alliance to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that Alliance will be required to expand its employee base and hire additional employees to support its operations as a public company which will increase its operating costs in future periods.

 The warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of the warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Alliance . The warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. Alliance will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of the warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in the warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a foreign action in the name of any holder of the warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an enforcement action ), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder. This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, Alliance may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. Alliance may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to a warrant holder, thereby making the warrants worthless . Alliance has the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which Alliance gives proper notice of such redemption and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable, Alliance may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or it is unable to effect such registration or qualification. Alliance will use its best efforts to register or qualify such shares of Class A common stock under the blue-sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered in the IPO. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell warrants at the then-current market price when the holder might otherwise wish to hold warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. None of the private warrants will be redeemable by Alliance so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If warrant holders exercise public warrants on a cashless basis, they will receive fewer shares of Alliance common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash . There are circumstances in which the exercise of the public warrants may be required or permitted to be made on a cashless basis. First, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by April 11, 2023, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Second, if a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 the Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when Alliance shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available; if that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. Third, if Alliance calls the public warrants for redemption, Alliance s management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (as defined in the next sentence) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the ten trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash. Risks Related to Our Securities Concentration of ownership among Alliance s executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions. As of March 29, 2023, the executive officers and directors and their affiliates collectively beneficially owned, directly, or indirectly, excluding Class E common stock, approximately 97 of the outstanding Class A common stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, appointment and removal of officers, any amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and approval of mergers and other business combination transactions requiring stockholder approval, including proposed transactions that would result in Alliance s stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares and other significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. An active trading market may not develop for our securities. Our Class A common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market. We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market in our Class A common stock or how liquid that market might become. If such a market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of Class A common stock at the time you wish to sell them, at a price that is attractive to you, or at all. The trading market for our Class A common stock in the future could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including, but not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations our ability or inability to generate revenues or profit the number of shares in our public float and increased competition. 
 Furthermore, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Additionally, moving forward we anticipate having a limited number of shares in our public float, and as a result, there could be extreme fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock.

 We might not be able to obtain or maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the listing standards of that exchange, which includes requirements that we maintain our stockholders equity, total value of shares held by unaffiliated stockholders, and market capitalization above certain specified levels. If we fail to conform to the Nasdaq listing requirements on an ongoing basis, our Class A common stock might cease to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and may move to the OTCQB or OTC Pink Open Market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. These quotation services are generally considered to be less efficient, and to provide less liquidity, than the Nasdaq Capital Market. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about Alliance, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding Alliance s securities adversely, the price and trading volume of Alliance s securities could decline. The trading market for Alliance s securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about Alliance, its business, market or competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on Alliance. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of Alliance, Alliance s share price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover Alliance change their recommendation regarding Alliance s shares of common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about its competitors, the price of Alliance s shares of common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover Alliance were to cease coverage of Alliance or fail to regularly publish reports on it, Alliance could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause its share price or trading volume to decline. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on Alliance s common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell Alliance s common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. Alliance may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and has no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of Alliance s board of directors and will depend on, among other things, Alliance s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that Alliance s board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, Alliance s ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness it or its subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Class A common stock unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. Alliance may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of the Class A common stock. As of the date of this annual report, Alliance has warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 9,920,000 shares of common stock. Pursuant to the Company s 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan, Alliance may issue an aggregate of up to 600,000 shares of Class A common stock, which amount may be subject to increase from time to time. For additional information about this plan, please read the discussion under the heading Alliance s Executive Compensation Employee Benefit Plans . Alliance may also issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances. The issuance of additional shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects: existing stockholders proportionate ownership interest in Alliance will decrease; the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease; the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common stock may be diminished; and the market price of the Class A common stock may decline.

 Anti-takeover provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of Alliance, which may be beneficial to its stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove Alliance s then current management. The Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may delay or prevent an acquisition of Alliance or a change in its management. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove members of its board of directors. Because the board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of the management team, these provisions could in turn frustrate or prevent any attempt by its stockholders to replace or remove its current management. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Class A common stock. Among other things, these provisions include: the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, its directors and officers; a prohibition on actions by its stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders; a prohibition on actions by its stockholders by written consent; and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a poison pill that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by the board of directors. 
 Moreover, because Alliance is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with Alliance for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15 or more of Alliance s outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with Alliance, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, its stockholders. This could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for Alliance s common stock, including transactions that may be in its stockholders best interests. Finally, these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. For more information, see the section titled Description of Securities Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and the Existing Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws . The Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder s counsel, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders. The Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in the name of Alliance, actions against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any officer, director or other employee of Alliance or Alliance s shareholders, any action asserting a claim against Alliance, its directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws and certain other actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit or make more costly a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm Alliance s business, operating results and financial condition. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, The Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless Alliance consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. There is, however, t uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. A possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand of our Class A common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in our Class A common stock. Investors may purchase our Class A common stock to hedge existing exposure in our Class A common stock or to speculate on the price of our Class A common stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our Class A common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional Class A common stock to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our Class A common stock and once investors purchase the shares of Class A common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our Class A common stock may decline. We may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or preferred shares under the 2023 Plan, which would dilute the interest of our stockholders. Pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, Alliance s authorized capital stock consists of 490,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 60,000,000 shares of Alliance Class E common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock under the 2023 Plan. The issuance of additional common stock or preferred shares: may significantly dilute the equity interest of holders of Class A common stock; may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if one or more classes of preferred stock are created, and such shares of preferred stock are issued, with rights senior to those afforded to Class A common stock; could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Class A common stock and/or warrants.

These include proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing, discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property rights. Depending on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, the Company may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, or injunctive orders. Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect Alliance s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters. While it is not possible to determine the outcomes, the Company believes based on its current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 5, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.

We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.

Pursuant to the BCA, Merger Sub merged with and into Alliance, with Alliance being the surviving entity (the Merger ).

 At the closing, the Company also issued to the Alliance stockholders shares of a to be formed Class E Common Stock (the Contingent Consideration Shares which were placed into an escrow account pursuant to the Contingent Consideration Shares Agreement and shall not be released from escrow over a ten-year period unless and until they are earned as a result of the occurrence of the applicable triggering event as follows: 20,000,000 Contingent Consideration Shares will be earned upon the occurrence of triggering event I prior to the five-year anniversary of the closing; 20,000,000 Contingent Consideration Shares will be earned upon the occurrence of triggering event II prior to the seven-year anniversary of the closing; and 20,000,000 Contingent Consideration Shares will be earned upon the occurrence of triggering event III prior to the ten-year anniversary of the closing. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the Contingent Consideration Shares released from the escrow shall automatically convert into an equal number of shares of Combined Company Common Stock. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. The Company is permitted to use interest earned on the proceeds placed in the trust account to pay taxes, which could include any excise tax due under the IR Act on any redemptions or stock buybacks by Adara. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from August 5, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of 2,943,538, which consists of changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities of 4,166,900 and interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account of 1,649,169, offset by operating and formation costs of 2,608,046 and provision for income taxes of 264,485.

Net income of 3,244,206 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Accounts of 10,281, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 4,297,300 and transaction cost incurred in connection with IPO of 86,544. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided 636,197 of cash from operating activities.

Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2022, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the Trust Account. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of 17,956 held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant. Liquidity Capital Resources and Going Concern Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. Until the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company used the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating target businesses, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar location of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structuring, negotiating and completing a Business Combination, which was the Business Combination with Alliance.

 Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on February 8, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Warrant Liabilities We account for the Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40-15-7D and 7F under which the Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, we classify the Warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the Warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each consolidated balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The Private Warrants and the Public Warrants for periods where no observable traded price was available are valued using a binomial lattice model, specifically a binomial lattice model. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units, the Public Warrant quoted market price was used as the fair value as of each relevant date. Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of our consolidated balance sheets. Net Loss per Common Share Net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We apply the two-class method in calculating income (loss) per common share, evenly allocating the net income (loss) to each class of stock. The deemed dividend associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is included in income (loss) per common share in the IPO quarter and year to date calculation in which the IPO occurred.

 Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have not adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2022. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data This information appears following Item 15 of this annual report and is included herein by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure On February 8, 2023, WithumSmith+Brown PC Withum ), Adara s independent registered public accounting firm prior to the Business Combination, was dismissed as Adara s independent registered public accounting firm effective following the completion of Adara s audit of the year-ended December 31, 2022, which consisted only of the accounts of the pre-Business Combination special purpose acquisition company, Adara. Withum s report on Adara s balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, other than the uncertainty surrounding Adara s ability to continue as a going concern. During the period from August 5, 2020 (inception) through the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, there were no: (i) disagreements with Withum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures or audited scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to Withum s satisfaction would have caused Withum to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report or (ii) reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K other than as described immediately below. On April 12, 2021, the SEC issued a Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies SPACs ), the Statement. In the Statement, the SEC indicates its view that certain terms of the warrants issued in connection with a SPAC Initial Public Offering Public Warrants and private placement warrants typically issued by a SPAC Private Warrants call for such warrants to be accounted for as liabilities and not as equity. The Company had recorded such warrants as equity. In light of the SEC s Statement Adara re-evaluated the guidance surrounding the Public and Private Warrants and determined that both Warrants should be recorded as a liability. This determination (liability vs. equity) caused the Company to restate previously issued financial statements that showed the warrants as equity. Further in December 2021 Adara determined that the Class A common stock contains a redemption feature that management has no control over and therefore all Class A shares should be recorded as temporary equity. This change caused the restatement of previously issued financial statements to effect this change. As a result of these restatements, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 11, 2021, March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021,

 March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, due to a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to a lack of an effectively designed control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting for complex financial instruments. The need to restate financial statements in these instances constitutes a material weakness in internal control. In response to the previously identified material weakness, Adara designed and implemented remediation measures to address the material weakness identified and enhanced its internal control over financial reporting. Adara has enhanced its financial reporting processes to better identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to its financial statements, including providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among Adara s personnel and third-party professionals with whom management consults regarding complex accounting applications. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.

Director Independence An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Donaldson, Finke, and Nagelson and Ms. Wielenga are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Committees of the Board of Directors Our board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the Nasdaq listing rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the Nasdaq listing rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each of the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating committee may have as one of its members a non-independent director under exceptional and limited circumstances pursuant to the exemptions under Rules 5605(c)(2)(B), 5605(d)(2)(B) and 5605(e)(3) of the Nasdaq listing rules.

Each member of the audit committee meets the independent director standard under the Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Ms. Wielenga qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;

 if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the SEC and any national securities exchange on which the Company is listed. 
 Nominating Committee Messrs. Finke, Donaldson and Chris Nagelson serve as members of the nominating committee. Mr. Finke serves as chair of the nominating committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards, all of the directors on the nominating committee must be independent, except that the nominating committee may, if it is comprised of at least three members, have as one of its members a non-independent director under exceptional and limited circumstances pursuant to the exemption under Rule 5605(e)(3) of the Nasdaq listing rules. The Nominating Committee Charter, which details the purpose and responsibilities of the nominating committee, includes: identifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors, consistent with criteria approved by the board, and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual general meeting or to fill vacancies on the board of directors; developing and recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines; coordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance of the company; and reviewing on a regular basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary. 
 The charter will also provide that the nominating committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of, and terminate, any search firm to be used to identify director candidates, and will be directly responsible for approving the search firm s fees and other retention terms. We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors will consider educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders. Prior to Closing our initial business combination, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board of directors. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such forms, we believe that since our inception on August 5, 2020 there have been no delinquent filers. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit, compensation and

In the event that a Named Executive Officer s employment is terminated due to his death, in addition to the foregoing, he would be entitled to a pro-rated portion of his annual bonus, as determined by the Board. In the event that a Named Executive Officer s employment is terminated either without cause (as defined in the applicable employment agreement) or by the Named Executive Officer for good reason (as defined in the applicable employment agreement), subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims and continued compliance with his restrictive covenant obligations, as described below, such Named Executive Officer would be entitled to payment of an amount (i) equal to the executive s base salary immediately prior to the termination date (or, if for good reason was attributable to the Company s failure to pay the minimum amount of Base Salary provided herein, such minimum amount) for the period of time from the day after the Termination Date through the last day of the employment term or for a period of twelve (12) months, whichever is greater (the Severance Period (ii) in addition to payment of any unpaid bonuses from a prior fiscal year, a pro-rata portion of the bonus based on the amount of days executive worked for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, and (iii) payment for such Named Executive Officer s insurance premiums incurred for participation in COBRA coverage pursuant group health plan through the earliest to occur of (A) the last day of the Severance Period, (B) the date the executive ceases to be eligible for COBRA or (C) such time as Executive is eligible for group health insurance benefits from another employer.

The Named Executive Officer must so execute the separation agreement within 60 days following the termination date.

However, we expect to implement a compensation program for our non-employee directors. Equity Plans Our board of directors adopted and approved the 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan, ), which was subsequently adopted by Alliance s stockholders. The 2023 Plan became effective on February 10, 2023 and is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which we can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to based officers, employees and directors of, and consultants and advisers to, Alliance and its subsidiaries. The purpose of the 2023 Plan is to help us attract, motivate and retain such persons with awards designed for the U.S. market and thereby enhance shareholder value.

The 2023 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards outstanding on that date). The Board of Directors in its discretion may terminate the 2023 Plan at any time with respect to any shares for which awards have not theretofore been granted; provided, however, that the 2023 Plan s termination shall not materially and adversely impair the rights of a holder, without the consent of the holder, with respect to any award previously granted. The number of shares of common stock for which awards which are options or SARs may be granted to a participant under the 2023 Plan during any calendar year is limited to a number of shares equal to three percent (3 of the total number of shares of common stock of the d Company outstanding on the last day of the prior calendar year. Future new hires, non-employee directors and additional non-employee consultants are eligible to participate in the 2023 Plan as well. The number of awards to be granted to officers, non-employee directors, employees and non-employee consultants cannot be determined at this time as the grant of awards is dependent upon various factors such as hiring requirements and job performance. Options. The term of each share option shall be as specified in the option agreement; provided, however, that except for share options which are incentive share options ISOs ), granted to an employee who owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules applicable under Code Section 424(d)) more than 10 of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock or the capital stock of our subsidiaries (a ten percent shareholder ), no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of its grant (five (5) years for an employee who is a ten percent shareholder). The price at which a share may be purchased upon exercise of a share option shall be determined by the Plan Committee; provided, however, that such option price (i) shall not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date such share option is granted, and (ii) shall be subject to adjustment as provided in the 2023 Plan. The Plan Committee or the board of directors shall determine the time or times at which or the circumstances under which a share option may be exercised in whole or in part, the time or times at which options shall cease to be or become exercisable following termination of the share option holder s employment or upon other conditions, the methods by which such exercise price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of such payment, and the methods by or forms in which common stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to participants who exercise share options.

The Plan Committee shall set forth in the applicable restricted share unit award agreement the individual service-based or performance-based vesting requirement which the holder would be required to satisfy before the holder would become entitled to payment and the number of units awarded to the Holder. The vesting restrictions under any restricted share unit award shall constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture under Section 409A of the Code. At the time of such award, the Plan Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms and conditions or restrictions. The holder of a restricted share unit shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share, or one (1) share, as determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Committee and as set forth in the restricted share unit award agreement, for each restricted share unit subject to such restricted share unit award, if and to the extent the applicable vesting requirement is satisfied.

The vesting restrictions under any performance under award shall constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture under Section 409A of the Code. At the time of such award, the Plan Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms and conditions or restrictions. The holder of a performance unit shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the dollar value assigned to such unit under the applicable performance unit award agreement if the holder and/or Alliance satisfy (or partially satisfy, if applicable under the applicable performance unit award agreement) the performance goals and objectives set forth in such performance unit award agreement.

Distribution Equivalent Rights.

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement.

The Placement Warrants were identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described above, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.

In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the change in the valuation allowance was and , respectively.

The Company utilizes a lattice model, specifically a binomial lattice model, to value the Representative Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the representative warrant liabilities are determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its shares of common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. The Public Warrants were initially valued using a lattice model, specifically a binomial lattice model. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Public Warrants were valued using the instrument s publicly listed trading price as of the consolidated balance sheet date, which is considered to be a Level 1 measurement due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the Private Warrants was the equivalent to that of the Public Warrants as they had substantially the same terms; however, they are not actively traded, as such are listed as a Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy table above. The key inputs into the binomial lattice model for the Warrants were as follows: Term (in years) Volatility Risk-free rate Dividend yield Exercise price Effective expiration date 6/26/26 6/26/26 5/11/25 6/23/26 8/09/25 One-touch hurdle

Exhibit 14 CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS OF ALLIANCE ENTERTAINMENT HOLDING CORPORATION The Board of Directors of Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation (the Company has adopted this Code of Conduct and Ethics (this Code to provide value for our shareholders; and To encourage honest and ethical conduct, including fair dealing and the ethical handling of conflicts of interest; To prompt full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure; To comply with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; To prompt internal reporting of violations of this Code; To protect the Company s legitimate business interests, including corporate opportunities, assets and confidential information; and To deter wrongdoing. All directors, officers, employees and independent contractors of the Company are expected to be familiar with this Code and to adhere to the principles and procedures set forth in this Code. For purposes of this Code, all directors, officers, employees and independent contractors are referred to collectively as employees or you throughout this Code. I. Honest and Ethical Conduct All directors, officers, employees and independent contractors owe duties to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and ethical. This includes the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity. All directors, officers, employees and independent contractors have the following duties: To conduct business with professional courtesy and integrity, and act honestly, fairly and in good faith without prejudice in all commercial dealings for a proper purpose which are in the best interests of the Company; To work in a safe, healthy and efficient manner, using skills, time and experience to the maximum of abilities; To comply with applicable awards, Company policies and job requirements, and adhere to a high standard of business ethics; To observe both the form and spirit of laws, governmental rules, regulations and accounting standards; Not to knowingly make any misleading statements to any person or to be a party to any improper practice in relation to dealings with or by the Company; To ensure that Company resources and properties are used properly; To maintain the confidentiality of information where required or consistent with Company policies; 
 1 

 and Not to disclose information or documents relating to the Company or its business, other than as required by law, not to make any unauthorized public comment on Company affairs and not to misuse any information about the Company or its associates, and not to accept improper or undisclosed material personal benefits from third parties as a result of any transaction or transactions of the Company. II. Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest arises when an individual s personal interest interferes or appears to interfere with the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can arise when a director, officer or employee takes actions or has personal interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work objectively and effectively. There are a variety of situations in which a conflict of interest may arise. While it would be impractical to attempt to list all possible situations, some common types of conflicts may be: To serve as a director, employee or contractor for a company that has a business relationship with, or is a competitor of the Company; To have a financial interest in a competitor, supplier or customer of the Company; To receive improper personal benefits from a competitor, supplier or customer, as a result of any transaction or transactions of the Company; To accept financial interest beyond entertainment or nominal gifts in the ordinary course of business, such as a meal or a coffee mug; To present at a conference where the conference sponsor has a real or potential business relationship with the Company (e.g. vendor, customer, or investor), and, the conference sponsor offers travel or accommodation arrangements or other benefits materially in excess of the Company s standard; or To use for personal gain, rather than for the benefit of the Company, an opportunity that you discovered through your role with the Company. Fidelity or service to the Company should never be subordinated to or dependent on personal gain or advantage. Conflicts of interest should be avoided. In most cases, anything that would constitute a conflict for a director, officer or employee also would present a conflict if it is related to a member of his or her family. Interests in other companies, including potential competitors and suppliers, that are purely for management of the other entity, or where an otherwise questionable relationship is disclosed to the Board and any necessary action is taken to ensure there will be no effect on the Company, are not considered conflicts unless otherwise determined by the Board. Evaluating whether a conflict of interest exists can be difficult and may involve a number of considerations. Please refer to other policies, such as the employee handbook, for further information. We also encourage you to seek guidance from your manager, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, when you have any questions or doubts. III. Disclosure Each director, officer or employee, to the extent involved in the Company s disclosure process, including the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, the (the Senior Financial Officers ), is required to be familiar with the Company s disclosure controls and procedures applicable to him or her so that the 
 2 

 Company s public reports and documents comply in all material respects with the applicable securities laws and rules. In addition, each such person having direct or supervisory authority regarding these securities filings or the Company s other public communications concerning its general business, results, financial condition and prospects should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility, consult with other Company officers and employees and take other appropriate steps regarding these disclosures with the goal of making full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure. Each director, officer or employee, to the extent involved in the Company s disclosure process, including the Senior Financial Officers, must: Familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company as well as the business and financial operations of the Company. Not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company, including to the Company s independent auditors, governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations. IV. Compliance It is the Company s policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is the personal responsibility of each employee, officer and director to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations in the performance of their duties for the Company, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters and insider trading. The Board endeavors to ensure that the directors, officers and employees of the Company act with integrity and observe the highest standards of behavior and business ethics in relation to their corporate activities. Specifically, directors, officers and employees must: Comply with the law; Act in the best interests of the Company; Be responsible and accountable for their actions; and Observe the ethical principles of fairness, honesty and truthfulness, including disclosure of potential conflicts. Generally, it is against Company policies for any individual to profit from undisclosed information relating to the Company or any other company in violation of insider trading or other laws. Anyone who is aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company, our customers, or other companies may not use the information to purchase or sell securities in violation of securities laws. If you are uncertain about the legal rules involving your purchase or sale of any Company securities or any securities in companies that you are familiar with by virtue of your work for the Company, you should consult with the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, before making any such purchase or sale. Other policies issued by the Company also provide guidance as to certain of the laws, rules and regulations that apply to the Company s activities. V. Reporting and Accountability The Board of Directors has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any director, officer or employee who becomes aware of any violation of this Code is required to notify the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, promptly. Any questions relating to how these policies should be interpreted or applied should be addressed to your manager, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents. Any material transaction or 
 3 

 relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest, as discussed in Section II of this Code, should be discussed with your manager, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents. A director, officer or employee who is unsure of whether a situation violates this Code should discuss the situation with the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, to prevent possible misunderstandings and embarrassment at a later date. Each director, officer or employee must: Notify the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, promptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code. Not retaliate against any other director, officer or employee for reports of potential violations. The Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code and in reporting on the Code: The Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, as the case may be, will take all appropriate action to investigate any violations reported. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, as appropriate, shall report each violation and alleged violation involving a director or an executive officer to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. To the extent he or she deems appropriate, the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall participate in any investigation of a director or executive officer. After the conclusion of an investigation of a director or executive officer, the conclusions shall be reported to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will conduct such additional investigation as it deems necessary. The Board will determine that a director or executive officer has violated this Code. Upon being notified that a violation has occurred, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, as the case may be, will take such disciplinary or preventive action as deemed appropriate, up to and including dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of appropriate law enforcement authorities. VI. Corporate Opportunities Employees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking (or directing to a third party) a business opportunity that is discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position, unless the Company has already been offered the opportunity and turned it down. More generally, employees, officers and directors are prohibited from using corporate property, information or position for personal gain and from competing with the Company. Sometimes, the line between personal and Company benefits is difficult to draw, and sometimes there are both personal and Company benefits in certain activities. Employees, officers and directors who intend to make use of Company property or services in a manner not solely for the benefit of the Company should consult beforehand with your manager, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents. VII. Confidentiality In carrying out the Company s business, employees, officers and directors often learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company, its customers, suppliers, or joint venture parties. Employees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of all information so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential or proprietary information of our Company, and of other companies, includes any non-public information that would be harmful to the relevant company or useful or helpful to competitors if disclosed. VIII. Fair Dealing . 
 4 

 Our core value of operating is based on responsiveness, openness, honesty and trust with our members, business partners, employees and shareholders. We do not seek competitive advantages through illegal or unethical business practices. Each employee, officer and director should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company s customers, service providers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No employee, officer or director should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice. IX. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets All employees, officers and directors should protect the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use. All Company assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on our profit. X. Waivers and Amendments From time to time, the Company may waive provisions of this Code. Any employee or director who believes that a waiver may be called for should discuss the matter with your manager, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents. Any waiver of the Code for executive officers (including Senior Financial Officers) or directors of the Company may be made only by the Board of Directors and must be promptly disclosed to shareholders along with the reasons for such waiver in a manner as required by applicable law or the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq ). Any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Code must be approved in writing by the Board or, if appropriate, its delegate(s) and promptly disclosed pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. Any waiver or modification of the Code for a Senior Financial Officer will be promptly disclosed to shareholders if and as required by applicable law or the rules of Nasdaq. The Company is committed to continuously reviewing and updating its policies, and therefore reserves the right to amend this Policy at any time, for any reason, subject to applicable law.
