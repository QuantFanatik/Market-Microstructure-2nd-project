For example, statements included in this Annual Report regarding our financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, and assumptions and predictions about future product demand, supply, manufacturing, costs, marketing and pricing factors are all forward-looking statements. When we use words like intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, plan or expect, or other words of a similar import, we are making forward-looking statements. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, based upon information available to us on the date hereof (but excluding the impact of COVID-19), but we cannot assure you that these assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct or that we will take any action that we may presently be planning. We have disclosed certain important factors (e.g., see Item 1. Business Preliminary Statements Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Effects of COVID-19 that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations elsewhere in this Annual Report. You should understand that forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report are necessarily qualified by these factors. We are not undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement if we obtain new information or upon the occurrence of future events or otherwise. 2 Table of Contents PART I Item 1. Business In this Annual Report, we, us and our refer to Black Bird Biotech, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Black Bird Potentials Inc., a Wyoming corporation BB Potentials ), Big Sky American Dist., LLC, a Montana limited liability company Big Sky American ), and Black Bird Hemp Manager, LLC, a Montana limited liability company. Preliminary Statements Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic had a discernable short-term negative impact on the ability of our company to obtain capital needed to accelerate the development of our business, as well as to obtain needed inventory, due to supply chain delays. While these limitations have eased, we are unable to predict when such limitations will be entirely resolved. Overall, our company is not of a size that required us to implement company-wide policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our product manufacturing operations have experienced no negative consequences attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, inasmuch as these operations involve a limited number of persons. For purposes of the discussion below, except where otherwise indicated, the descriptions of our business, our strategies, our risk factors and any other forward-looking statements, including regarding us, our business and the market generally, do not reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or our responses thereto. Our Company After Acquiring Black Bird Potentials Inc. With the January 2020 acquisition of Black Bird Potentials Inc. (BB Potentials), our company emerged from its long-standing status as a shell company. Our Board of Directors has adopted the business plan of BB Potentials and our company s ongoing operations now include those of BB Potentials. Developments In March 2022, our company launched the first major initiative in marketing our MiteXstream biopesticide on a national basis, when we entered into a consulting agreement with Spire+, a Cornelius, North Carolina-based leading sales and marketing agency that specializes in brand building, marketing, communications and business development. Spire+ has begun work to implement a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. Spire+, an affiliate of Spire Sports + Entertainment, LLC, has a long history of building and executing successful sales and marketing programs for brands, such as Toyota, 5-hour ENERGY, Auto-Owners Insurance, ENEOS Motor Oil, Petro-Canada, STP and Parker Hannifin. Business Overview MiteXstream . BB Potentials is the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of MiteXstream, an EPA-registered plant-based biopesticide effective in the eradication of mites and similar pests, including spider mites, a pest that destroys crops, especially cannabis, hops, coffee, and house plants, as well as molds and mildew. CBD and Other Products . Through BB Potentials, we manufacture and sell CBD products, including CBD Oils, gummies and pet treats, and CBD-infused personal care products, under the Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name. Big Sky American currently distributes an array of consumer products, including the Grizzly Creek Naturals products, to retail locations in Western Montana. MiteXstream Worldwide Exclusivity . At the present time, our future success is primarily dependent upon our ability to achieve market penetration of MiteXstream. Pursuant to a February 2021 Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution License Agreement (the New MiteXstream Agreement with Touchstone Enviro Solutions, Inc. Touchstone ), a company owned by three of our directors, Fabian G. Deneault, L. A. Newlan, Jr. and Eric Newlan, BB Potentials possesses the exclusive rights, even as to Touchstone, to manufacture, sell and distribute MiteXstream, an EPA-registered biopesticide (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). The exclusivity granted would be reduced to a status of non-exclusivity, should we fail to manufacture at least 2,500 gallons of concentrate in any year during the term of the New MiteXstream Agreement; provided, however, that such minimum required is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022. We are required to pay Touchstone a royalty of 10 per gallon of MiteXstream manufactured by us or by any sublicensee of ours. For no further consideration, we were granted the rights to use the MiteXstream trademark and the Harnessing the Power of Water trademark. 3 Table of Contents The New MiteXstream Agreement replaced a prior similar agreement with Touchstone (the Original MiteXstream Agreement and served to expand our company s rights with respect to MiteXstream. The New MiteXstream Agreement contains the following important provisions as compared to the Original MiteXstream Agreement: New MiteXstream Agreement Original MiteXstream Agreement Term December 31, 2080 Initial terms of 10 years, with one 10-year renewal term Territory Worldwide Exclusive (1) United States and Canada Royalty 10.00 per gallon manufactured Effective royalty of an estimated 50 per gallon Minimums 2,500 gallons of concentrate manufactured per year (2) 20,000 of product per year Sublicensing Right to sublicense granted No right to sublicense Trademarks For no extra consideration, rights granted to use MiteXstream and Harnessing the Power of Water For no extra consideration, rights granted to use MiteXstream (1) Exclusivity ends and becomes non-exclusive, if the minimum of 2,500 gallons per year is not met. (2) The minimum (2,500 gallons per year) is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022. The disinterested Directors of our Company approved the New MiteXstream Agreement. Approval as Biopesticide . Effective December 16, 2020, MiteXstream was approved as a biopesticide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). MiteXstream has been approved for sale in 44 states, with applications pending in the remaining states, except for California, the application for which is in the final stage of preparation. In addition, we intend to seek approval of MiteXstream in countries around the world, although no specific time for such actions has been set. Sales and Distribution . Online . We sell MiteXstream directly to customers though our website, MiteXstream.com. Our marketing efforts during the remainder of 2022 will be centered around driving customer traffic to the website for purchases MiteXstream, as well as to our Amazon page. Spire+ is focused on these efforts. Spire+ . In March 2022, our company launched the first major initiative in marketing our MiteXstream biopesticide on a national basis, when we entered into a consulting agreement with Spire+, a Cornelius, North Carolina-based leading sales and marketing agency that specializes in brand building, marketing, communications and business development. Spire+ has begun work to implement a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. Spire+, an affiliate of Spire Sports + Entertainment, LLC, has a long history of building and executing successful sales and marketing programs for brands, such as Toyota, 5-hour ENERGY, Auto-Owners Insurance, ENEOS Motor Oil, Petro-Canada, STP and Parker Hannifin. Other Opportunities . In March 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with IFC Fulfillment Company IFC ), a Los Angeles-based export firm, whereby IFC was appointed the exclusive distributor for MiteXstream in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. One of our Directors, Jack Jie Qin, facilitated the signing of the IFC Agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report, IFC has not made a sale of MiteXstream. The Genesis of MiteXstream . Our President, Fabian G. Deneault, was, from 2017 through 2019, a licensed dispenser of medical marijuana (MMJ) in the State of Montana and, as such, was permitted to grow marijuana plants for use in his MMJ dispensary business. As a licensed medical marijuana grower, Mr. Deneault encountered infestations of spider mites on his plants. To combat the spider mites, Mr. Deneault developed the MiteXstream formulation (see Product Effectiveness below). Mr. Deneault soon came to understand that the spider mite issue is a cannabis-industry-wide issue. In fact, all types of mites and similar pests are a significant pest in the production of a wide array of agricultural crops worldwide, including coffee, hops and strawberries, among other agricultural crops. Product Effectiveness and Independent Testing . In original testing done by our company, we determined that, when mixed with water at the prescribed dilution rate, MiteXstream is effective in eliminating mites, including spider mites, and similar pests and their eggs, with no risk of plant damage. Additionally, MiteXstream eliminates molds and mildews on all types of plants. 4 Table of Contents Honey Bee Testing - Contact Toxicity and Oral Toxicity . Independent lab testing has proven MiteXstream TM to be NOT TOXIC to honey bees when contacted topically or when ingested. Performing Lab : STILLMEADOW, Inc., Sugar Land, Texas. Study Director : Cole Younger, PhD., Entomologist, STILLMEADOW, Inc. MiteXstream: Honey bee, Apis mellifera , Acute Contact Toxicity Limit Test MiteXstream: Honey Bee, Apis mellifera , Acute Oral Toxicity Limit Test Conclusion : With a mortality of 0 after 48 hours , MiteXstream was non-toxic when administered by contact to honey bees. Conclusion : With a mortality of 0 after 48 hours , MiteXstream was non-toxic when ingested by honey bees. BRIM Efficacy Testing . In February 2022, British Columbia, Canada-based laboratory Botanical Research in Motion (BRIM) published its Efficacy Testing Report on MiteXstream. The BRIM Report was authored by Dr. Fawzia Afreen, who, in addition to holding three international patents, publishing over 40 articles in peer-reviewed international journals and publishing two books, possesses nearly 20 years of experience in plant horticulture, plant tissue culture and plant production. The BRIM Report, entitled MiteXstream - a new, safe, environmentally friendly and the most effective biopesticide for controlling pests in Cannabis, details the extensive testing procedures undertaken and ends with the following summary assessment: To summarize, the major findings of the study are: MiteXstream biopesticide can be a safe alternative of chemical pesticides and to achieve the maximum benefit the use of full-strength full strength concentration without any addition of surfactant is recommended. It can effectively control or eradicate the spider mites and powdery mildew as well as work as a preventative measure when applied at the appropriate dose, time, and stage. The use of MiteXstream is not limited to Cannabis it can be used to control pest infestation in a wide range of plants. Cannabis-Specific Independent Lab Testing . Based on independent lab testing, users of MiteXstream are able to treat their cannabis (marijuana) plants through the day of harvest and still satisfy state-level pesticide testing standards. In January 2019, Stillwater Labs, an Olney, Montana-based medical marijuana testing facility, concluded its testing of a cannabis sample treated only with MiteXstream. In addition to testing for pesticides prohibited by the State of Montana, Stillwater Labs also tested for pesticides prohibited by the State of Oregon, the most stringent state-level marijuana testing standard. The results of this testing, presented as being measured in parts per billion (PPB), are set forth below.

Competition . The pesticide industry is characterized by severe competition, evolving industry standards, evolving business and distribution models, price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, and price sensitivity on the part of customers. Many of our competitors possess substantially greater resources, financial and otherwise, than does our company. In addition, MiteXstream lacks name recognition. Our future success will depend on our ability to gain product name recognition and customer loyalty, as well as our being able to anticipate and respond to emerging standards and other unforeseen changes. If we fail to satisfy such standards of operation, our operating results could suffer. Further, intra-industry consolidations may result in stronger competitors and may, therefore, also harm our future results of operations. There is no assurance that we will ever overcome these challenges. Regulation . Field testing, production and marketing of pesticide products are regulated by federal, state, local and foreign governments. The EPA regulates pesticides in the U.S. under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended FIFRA ). Pesticides also are regulated by the states. MiteXstream is registered under FIFRA and, prior to sale in any state, will be approved by such state. CBD and Other Products CBD Products . We have created Grizzly Creek Naturals as the brand name for our CBD-related products, which are manufactured by our company using CBD purchased from third parties. Our line of Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products are currently manufactured by BB Potentials. The Grizzly Creek Naturals product line includes CBD Oils, CBD Body Butter, CBD Lip Balm, CBD Sports Roll-on and CBD Bath Bombs. In addition, we sell CBD gummies on a private-label basis. Other Products . Since Big Sky American started its distribution efforts, we have distributed a wide array of non-CBD consumer items to retail locations in Western Montana. These products include food items, clothing items and items associated with outdoor activities. 6 Table of Contents During the COVID-19 pandemic, we began the manufacture and sale of our Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer to distributors, directly to retail customers and directly to consumers through our website, after completed our FDA product listing in March 2020. We determined recently to cease the production of our hand sanitizer products. Distribution . In-House Distribution . Since it began to manufacture and sell its CBD products in mid-2019, BB Potentials has self-distributed its products. In December 2020, these distribution efforts we formalized with the formation of Big Sky American. Big Sky American currently distributes an array of consumer products, including the Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products, to retail locations in Western Montana. In December 2020, Big Sky American entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Big Sky APA ), whereby it purchased certain distribution-related assets associated with approximately 200 retail locations in Western Montana for 200,000 in cash. These assets became available for purchase, due their owner s determination to terminate its distribution business in such locations. The closing of under the Big Sky APA occurred in February 2021. Online . Our Grizzly Creek Naturals products are sold to consumers through our website, GrizzlyCreekNaturals.com. Third-Party Distributors . In 2020, we entered into a letter agreement with Las Vegas, Nevada-based Hope Botanicals LLC (the Hope Distributor ), with respect to its selling our products primarily in the Las Vegas area and the Hope Distributor continues to purchase small amounts of products from us. We continue to seek additional distributors who are able to demonstrate, to our management s satisfaction, an ability to develop sales for our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products. Perceived Benefits of CBD . The recent growth in sales of CBD products is primarily due to perceived benefits expressed by those who have used CBD products. While our company does not make any claims as to the effectiveness or potential benefits of CBD, the following perceived benefits expressed by those who have used CBD products include, among others: Relief for Chronic Pain Reduces Seizures Reduces Anxiety and Depression Reduces Inflammation Promotes Healthy Weight Improves Heart Health Improves Skin Conditions (Source: CBD Oil Benefits and Uses for Pain, Anxiety, Cancer and More, Dr. Josh Axe, DC, DMN, CNS; https://draxe.com/cbd-oil-benefits) Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses . With respect to our Grizzly Creek Naturals products, we believe our company possesses the following competitive strengths and weaknesses: Competitive Strengths: our products are produced using high-quality ingredients we enjoy low overhead costs Competitive Weaknesses: none of our products enjoys brand name recognition we possess limited capital we have limited personnel Competition . The competition for customers in the CBD market is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no significant barriers to entry. We expect competitive conditions to increase over time. There is no assurance that our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products will achieve profitability in the face of such competition. Regulation . Under the 2018 Farm Bill, CBD products may be sold legally, if and only if the hemp from which the CBD is derived is produced in a manner consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill, associated federal regulations, associated state regulations and by a licensed grower. Our CBD products are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill. Industrial Hemp-Related Activities In 2020, we formed a division of our company that was to focus on industrial hemp-related business opportunities under the Black Bird American Hemp brand name. During 2020 and early 2021, Black Bird American Hemp sought to develop industrial hemp processing operations in the State of Montana. However, during 2021, our management determined that market conditions, especially as it relates to attracting investors, related to the industrial hemp industry had waned, and we suspended our industrial hemp activities for the foreseeable future. 7 Table of Contents During 2020 and 2021, BB Potentials was a licensed hemp grower in Montana under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program. BB Potentials did not grow commercial quantities of hemp during either year. No 2022 application for a license was submitted by BB Potentials and we do not intend to submit and application during 2023. Insurance We have not yet purchased product liability or other insurance. However, our management intends to secure a commercially reasonable product liability insurance policy in March 2023. Intellectual Property In General . We regard our rights to intellectual property pertaining to MiteXstream and Grizzly Creek Naturals and our business know-how as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. Our policy is to establish, enforce and protect our intellectual property rights using the intellectual property laws. Patents . Currently, we own no interest in any patent or patent application. None of the products that we sell in our business is the subject of any patent or patent application. Due to such lack of patent protection, neither our company nor our licensor may be able to defend our or its rights to such intellectual property. Trademarks . We are the owner of the Grizzly Creek Naturals and Black Bird American Hemp trademarks and have the exclusive right to the use of the MiteXstream trademark. In addition, we have the right to use the Harnessing the Power of Water trademark, in associated with MiteXstream. We have filed a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with respect to MiteXstream. It is intended that, in the near future, filings for the registration of our other trademarks will be made with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will be made. Property From 2014 through May 2020, our current Director and former CEO, Jack Jie Qin, provided office space to our company at no cost. In May 2020, BB Potentials entered into a facility lease with Grizzly Creek Farms, LLC, an entity owned by one our Directors, Fabian G. Deneault, with respect to approximately 2,000 square feet of manufacturing space located in Ronan, Montana. Monthly rent under such lease was 1,500 and the initial term of such lease expired in December 2025. This lease was terminated effective April 1, 2021. Since such date, Mr. Deneault permits BB Potentials to utilize the previously-leased facility for storage, at no charge.

Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC PINK tier of the OTC Markets under the symbol BBBT. Trading in OTC PINK stocks can be volatile, sporadic and risky, as thinly traded stocks tend to move more rapidly in price than more liquid securities. Such trading may also depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their common stock. The following table reflects the high and low closing price for our common stock for the periods indicated. The information was obtained from the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and reflects inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, markdown or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

Penny Stock The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. 10 Table of Contents In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, shareholders may have difficulty selling our securities. Holders of Our Common Stock As of March 7, 2023, we had 479,970,663 outstanding shares of common stock and 77 shareholders of record. Dividends There are no restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The payment of dividends on common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: (1) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (2) our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution. We currently do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of 2022, we issued no unregistered securities that have not been previously reported. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we have issued the following unregistered securities that have not been previously reported: 1. (a) Securities Sold.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Effects of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic had a discernable short-term negative impact on the ability of our company to obtain capital needed to accelerate the development of our business, as well as to obtain needed inventory, due to supply chain delays. While these limitations have eased, we are unable to predict when such limitations will be entirely resolved. Overall, our company is not of a size that required us to implement company-wide policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our product manufacturing operations have experienced no negative consequences attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, inasmuch as these operations involve a limited number of persons. For purposes of the discussion below, except where otherwise indicated, the descriptions of our business, our strategies, our risk factors and any other forward-looking statements, including regarding us, our business and the market generally, do not reflect the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or our responses thereto. Basis of Presentation This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes financial results of our company, Black Bird Biotech, Inc., including its subsidiaries, Black Bird Potentials Inc. (BB Potentials), Big Sky American Dist., LLC (Big Sky American) and Black Bird Hemp Manager, LLC, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Cautionary Statement The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes, beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the following discussion, as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described herein under Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements included herein. Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. 12 Table of Contents In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Critical Accounting Policies In General . Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements beginning on page F-1. We consider our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition, inventory and fair value of financial instruments. Change in Accounting Principle . In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Our company has early-adopted ASU 2020-06 for the year beginning January 1, 2021. Overview and Outlook With the acquisition of BB Potentials effective January 1, 2020, BB Potentials operations became the operations of our company. Through BB Potentials, our company is the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of MiteXstream, an EPA-registered plant-based biopesticide (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1) effective in the eradication of mites and similar pests, including spider mites, a pest that destroys crops, especially cannabis, hops, coffee, and house plants, as well as molds and mildew. Also through BB Potentials, we manufacture and sell CBD products, including CBD Oils, gummies and pet treats, and CBD-infused personal care products, under the Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name. Big Sky American distributes our Grizzly Creek Naturals products, as well as an array of other consumer retail products, in Western Montana. In addition, for 2020 and 2021, BB Potentials was a licensed grower of industrial hemp under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program and, in connection therewith, established Black Bird American Hemp as the brand name under which these efforts were to be conducted. For the foreseeable future, we have suspended our hemp-related efforts. Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance Following our acquisition of BB Potentials, our future operating results can be expected to be primarily affected by the following factors: our ability to establish and maintain the value proposition of our MiteXstream biopesticide, vis-a-vis other available pest control products; our ability to generate sales channels for MiteXstream; and our ability to contain our operating costs. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2022 Fiscal 2022 and 2021 Fiscal 2021 . During Fiscal 2022, we established a MiteXstream Store on Amazon.com, which accounted for approximately 3,500 in sales. While these sales demonstrated the economic viability of MiteXstream, such sales were not at a level that provided cash for use in our overall operations. During 2023, we intend to increase our Amazon-specific marketing, in an attempt to garner more sales through our Amazon Store. 13 Table of Contents Our purchase of certain distribution-related assets in Fiscal 2021 pursuant to the Big Sky APA was made with an expectation that an immediately accessible larger number of retail locations would allow us to increase more quickly sales of our CBD products. Big Sky American, since beginning its consumer product distribution operations in Northwest Montana in April 2021, had a positive impact on our Fiscal 2021 operating results, when compared to our prior operating results. However, the anticipated increase in sales of our CBD products has not occurred. Rather, sales of non-CBD consumer products, in large measure, accounted for the overall increase in our product sales for Fiscal 2021. During Fiscal 2021, sales of MiteXstream were insignificant. During Fiscal 2022, our business operations generated 82,563 in revenues from sales with a cost of goods sold of 49,551, resulting in a gross profit of 33,012. During Fiscal 2021, our business operations generated 104,458 in revenues with a cost of goods sold of 84,871, resulting in a gross profit of 19,587. While we had a small level of sales of MiteXstream during 2022, the decline in our revenues from the year ended December 31, 2021, is attributable primarily to the significant drop in tourism in Western Montana during the summer of 2022, due to inflationary pressures that resulted an extreme increase in gas prices. During Fiscal 2022, we incurred operating expenses of 1,321,345, which were comprised of 231,630 in consulting services, 5,337 in website expenses, 43,247 in legal and professional services, 4,800 in rent, 234,519 in advertising and marketing expense and 673,621 in general and administrative expense, resulting in a net operating loss of 1,288,333. In addition, we incurred interest expense of 370,587, resulting in a net loss for Fiscal 2022 of 1,658,766. During Fiscal 2021, we incurred operating expenses of 1,470,714, which were comprised of 725,240 in consulting services 573,348 of which was paid by the issuance of common stock), 12,328 in website expenses, 84,457 in legal and professional services, 10,320 in rent, 5,234 in advertising and marketing expense and 523,478 in general and administrative expense, resulting in a net operating loss of 1,451,127. In addition, we incurred interest expense of 285,327, resulting in a net loss for Fiscal 2021 of 1,811,302. We expect that our revenues will increase from quarter to quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2023, as sales of MiteXstream and Grizzly Creek Naturals products are expected to increase from our continuing marketing efforts. There is no assurance that such will be the case, and we expect to incur operating losses through at least December 31, 2023. Further, because of our relative current lack of capital and the current lack of brand name awareness of MiteXstream, we cannot predict the levels of our future revenues. Further, because of our relative current lack of capital and the current lack of brand name awareness of MiteXstream and Grizzly Creek Naturals, we cannot predict the levels of our future revenues. However, our management believes that MiteXstream will become the most dynamic, fastest growing part of our business. Plans for 2023 Substantially all of our available capital, financial and human, will be devoted to increasing sales of MiteXstream. Through our marketing consulting agreement with Spire+, we are implementing a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. In addition, our internal efforts will be focused on developing sales channels outside the scope of the Spire+ efforts. There is no assurance that we will be successful in increasing sales of MiteXstream. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources December 31, 2022 . At December 31, 2022, our company had 44,448 in cash and a working capital deficit of 726,463, compared to 499,766 in cash and working capital of 574,165 at December 31, 2021. The change in our working capital position from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, is attributable primarily to our incurring 1,013,980 in debt and our repayment of 510,560 in debt, the payment of significantly increased marketing expenses and the payment of operating expenses. Our company s current cash position of approximately 30,000 is not adequate for our company to maintain its present level of operations through the second quarter of 2023. We must obtain additional capital from third parties to implement our full business plans. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital. Capital Sources . We have derived capital from sales of our common stock and from loans. Our capital sources are described below. Regulation A Offerings . In May 2020, our company filed an Offering Statement on Form 1-A (File No. 054-11215) (the Reg A #1 with the SEC with respect to 70,000,000 shares of common stock, as amended, which was qualified by the SEC on August 4, 2020.

Inflation Our management believes economic conditions point toward continuing significant inflationary pressures for the foreseeable future. However, no prediction can be made in this regard and, further, no prediction can be made with respect to how the potential impact any inflation would affect our future results of operations. However, during the summer of 2022, the sales of our Big Sky American subsidiary were impacted negatively by inflationary pressures that caused a significant reduction in tourism in Western Montana primarily attributable to a sharp increase in gas prices. Seasonality For the foreseeable future, we expect that our operating results with respect to MiteXstream will be impacted, in an indeterminate measure, by the seasonality of farming operations, including cannabis grow operations. However, we are currently unable to predict the level to which such seasonality will impact our MiteXstream business.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Please see our Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no changes, in or disagreements with, our independent auditor. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our President and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective at December 31, 2022. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. As an emerging growth company experiencing rapid growth, we have worked diligently to improve processes within our company, specifically including within our manufacturing environment, that increase risk related to transaction processing which can impact our financial reporting. We intend to implement a significant number of manual compensating controls to address this risk. 20 Table of Contents Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Our management, including our President and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 2013 Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this Annual Report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report by our company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that require our company to provide only our company s management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Audited Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. F-1 Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-2 Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-3 Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-4 Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 F-5 Notes to Financial Statements F-6 33 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Black Bird Biotech, Inc. (formerly Digital Development Partners, Inc.) Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Black Bird Biotech, Inc. (formerly Digital Development Partners, Inc.) and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2021 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern Matter The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and also has only a small capital surplus that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Description of the Matter As disclosed in Notes 9, 16 and 22 to the financial statements, the Company had certain debt and equity-linked transactions where management evaluated required accounting considerations, significant estimates, and judgments related to these instruments. There is no current observable market for the Company s warrants, therefore, the Company used the Black-Scholes model to measure the fair value of the equity-linked instruments. Due to this valuation method used by the Company a high degree of auditor judgment and effort was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the accounting and valuations around these transactions. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed In the Audit We obtained a listing of all debt and equity-linked transactions and management s analysis supporting these transactions. We evaluated the accounting for these transactions based on agreements obtained to ensure these were properly recorded during the year. We evaluated the valuation model that management selected to determine the estimated grant date fair value, and analyzed the underlying inputs used to estimate the fair value of the equity-linked instruments. /s/ Farmer, Fuqua, Huff, P.C.

These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2022. Additionally, the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets. The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans. While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
