 PART I. Item 1. Our Business Overview Trust Stamp was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 11, 2016 as T Stamp Inc. T Stamp Inc. and its subsidiaries Trust Stamp , we , or the Company develop and market identity authentication software for enterprise and government partners and peer-to-peer markets. Trust Stamp develops proprietary artificial intelligence-powered identity and trust solutions at the intersection of biometrics, privacy, and cybersecurity, that enable organizations to protect themselves and their users, while empowering individuals to retain ownership of their identity data and prevent fraudulent activity using their identity. Trust Stamp tackles industry challenges including data protection, regulatory compliance, and financial accessibility, with cutting edge technology including biometric science, cryptography, and machine learning. Our core technology irreversibly transforms identity information to create tokenized identifiers that enable accurate authentication without the need to store or share sensitive data. By retaining the usefulness of biometric-derived data while minimizing the risk, we allow businesses to adopt biometrics and other anti-fraud initiatives while protecting personal information from hacks and leaks. Trust Stamp s key sub-markets are identity authentication for the purpose of account opening, access and fraud detection, the creation of tokenized digital identities to facilitate financial and societal inclusion, and in-community case management software for alternatives to detention and other governmental uses. As biometric solutions proliferate, so does the need to protect biometric data. Stored biometric images and templates represent a growing and unquantified financial, security and PR liability and are the subject of governmental, media and public scrutiny, since biometric data cannot be changed once they are hacked, as they are directly linked to the user s physical features and/or behaviors. Privacy concerns around biometric technology have led to close attention from regulators, with multiple jurisdictions placing biometrics in a special or sensitive category of personal data and demanding much stronger safeguards around collection and safekeeping. To address this unprecedented danger and increased cross-industry need to establish trust quickly and securely in virtual environments, Trust Stamp has developed its Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token, or IT 2TM , solutions, which replace biometric templates with a cryptographic hash that can never be rebuilt into the original data and cannot be used to identify the subject outside the environment for which it is designed. Trust Stamp s data transformation and comparison technology is vendor and modality agnostic, allowing organizations including other biometric services providers to benefit from the increased protection, efficiency, and utility of our proprietary tokenization process. With online and offline functionality, Trust Stamp technology is effective in even the most remote locations in the world. Trust Stamp also offers end-to-end solutions for multi-factor biometric authentication for account access and recovery, KYC/AML compliance, customer onboarding, and more, which allow organizations to approve more genuine users, keep bad actors from accessing systems and services, and retain existing users with a superior user experience. Our Markets Trust Stamp has evaluated the market potential for its services in part by reviewing the following reports, articles, and data sources, none of which were commissioned by the Company, and none of which are to be incorporated by reference: Data security and fraud In 2022, 4,145 publicly disclosed breaches exposed over 22 billion records according to the 2021 Year End Report: Data Breach QuickView published by Flashpoint. The cumulative merchant losses to online payment fraud between 2023 and 2027 will exceed 343 billion globally according to a 2022 report titled Fighting Online Payment Fraud in 2022 Beyond published by Juniper Research.

 Trust Stamp addresses this market with biometric identity verification and biometric authentication - which utilizes Trust Stamp s proprietary irreversible identity token to perform biometric matching in a secure and tokenized domain, matching tokenized personally identifiable information and liveness detection. Biometric authentication By 2027, the value of biometrically authenticated remote mobile payments will reach 1.2 trillion globally, according to a 2022 report titled Mobile Payment Biometrics published by Juniper Research. The global biometric system market size is valued at 41.1 billion per annum in 2023, with a forecast compound growth of 20.4 from 2023 to 2030 with a 2030 revenue forecast of 150.6 billion according to the 2023 report titled Biometric Technology Market Size, Share Trends Analysis Report By Component, By Offering, By Authentication Type, By Application, By End-use, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2023 2030 published by Grand View Research. 
 Trust Stamp addresses this market through its biometric authentication and liveness detection - which utilizes Trust Stamp s proprietary irreversible identity token to perform biometric matching in a secure and tokenized domain. This permits biometric authentication without the risk of storing pictures and biometric templates. Financial and societal inclusion As of 2021, 1.4 billion people were unbanked according to the Global Findex Database 2021 published by The World Bank. 131 million small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets lack access to finance, limiting their ability to grow and thrive (UNSGSA Financial Inclusion Webpage, Accessed March 2023) The global market for Microfinance is estimated at 157 Billion in the year 2020, and is projected to reach 342 billion by 2026 according to the 2022 report titled Microfinance - Global Market Trajectory Analytics published by Global Industry Analysts, Inc. 
 Trust Stamp s biometric authentication, liveness detection, and information tokenization enable individuals to verify and establish their identities using biometrics. While individuals in this market lack traditional means of identity verification, Trust Stamp provides a means to authenticate identity that preserves an individual s privacy and control over that identity. Alternatives to Detention ATD The ATD market includes Federal, State and Municipal agencies for both criminal justice and immigration purposes and there is an accelerating interest in technology-based solutions that the Company is able to offer. Amongst the use cases, a large and growing market is for the provision of alternatives to detention for immigrants that are awaiting a final disposition of their processing. Addressing the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Homeland Security on May 17, 2022, ICE Acting Director stated that the financial year 2023 Budget submitted by ICE for approval included an additional 75,000,000 for the Alternatives to Detention ATD program over and above the present appropriation and that ICE is focusing on ATD instead of more expensive physical detention programs; both because of the threat of COVID and because ATD is less expensive and more humane. On that same day, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee shared that 230,000 participants were then in the ICE ATD program with a planned increase to 600,000 participants. 
 Trust Stamp addresses the ATD market with an application built on Trust Stamp s privacy-preserving biometrics. Trust Stamp provides hardware and software that provides for the ethical and human tracking of individuals to comply with ATD requirements. Trust Stamp s key sub-markets are: i) Identity authentication for the purpose of account opening, access and fraud detection; ii) The creation of tokenized digital identities to facilitate financial and societal inclusion; and

 iii) In-community case-management services for governmental agencies. 
 In addition to its key sub-markets, the Company is developing products and working with partners and industry organizations in other sectors that offer significant market opportunities, in particular, the travel, healthcare, Metaverse platform and cryptographic key and account credential safekeeping sectors. For example, the Company has developed a crypto key vault solution that leverages proven facial biometric authentication and irreversible data transformation technology to protect private keys for digital assets while ensuring long-term data protection and access credential availability. Principal Products and Services Trust Stamp s most important technology is the Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token TM (also known as the IT 2TM , Evergreen Hash TM , EgHash TM and MyHash TM combined with a data architecture that can use one or multiple sources of biometric or other identifying data. Once a hash translation algorithm is created, like-modality hashes are comparable regardless of their origin. The IT 2 protects against system and data redundancy, providing a lifelong digital-DNA that can store (or pivot to) any type of KYC or relationship data with fields individually hashed or (salted and) encrypted, facilitating selective data sharing. Products utilizing the IT 2 are Trust Stamp s primary products, accounting for the majority of its revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022. We adhere to the best practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and International Organization for Standardization ISO frameworks, and our policies and procedures in managing personally identifiable information PII are in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation GDPR requirements. IT 2 Solutions The IT 2 (for Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token) replaces biometric templates and scans with meaningless numbers, letters, and symbols in order to remove sensitive data from the reach of criminals using a proprietary process by which a deep neural network irreversibly converts biometric and other identifying data, from any source, into the secure tokenized identity. This IT 2 is unique to the user, is different every time it is generated from a live subject and cannot be reverse engineered and rebuilt into the user s face or other original identity data. Each token can be stored and compared to all other tokens from the same modality, allowing the Company s AI-powered analytics to predict if a single subject has generated two or more tokens, even if the subject has passed conventional KYC with, e.g., falsified identity

 documents. Using this technology, an IT 2 can be employed for re-authentication purposes, including account recovery, password-less login, new account creation, and more, across the organization or even within a consortium of organizations, all in a low cost and low friction delivery that is fast and secure. Our technology is being used for enhanced due diligence, KYC/AML compliance, synthetic identity fraud reduction and second chance approval for customer onboarding and account access, together with the delivery of humanitarian and development services. The solution allows organizations to approve more users, keep bad actors from accessing systems and services, and retain existing users with a superior user experience. Our hashing and matching technology can maximize the effectiveness of all types of identity data, while rendering it safer to use, store, and share. Whatever the source of identity data, it can be stored and compared as an IT 2 . See the chart below for examples. Distribution Through licensing we allow customers to utilize our technology in a wide variety of applications. Uses can include (e.g.): o The provision of hashing / services to enterprises, NGOs, and government, to overlay on third-party biometric and identity data o Hash licensing, translation, and certification services for biometric vendors o Management of zero-knowledge-proof services, whether as a tributary between Identity Lakes or operating consortium lakes o Tokenized identity creation for large scale deployments, such as humanitarian and government identity programs. 
 Trust Stamp enters into licensing and SaaS agreements.

Table of Contents 
 License agreements are typically as a hosted offering, on-premise solution, or both, with its customers, pursuant to which the customer pays for the initial product development plus a license fee for the use of Trust Stamp s technologies on a periodic and/or volume-based basis. In addition to consuming and paying for Trust Stamp s services for their own use, some key customers also serve as channel partners by offering Trust Stamp products to their own customer base, whether as stand-alone products, or integrated into their own services as upgraded product offerings. SaaS agreements are typically serviced through the Company s Orchestration Layer platform, which is being utilized in FIS new global identity authentication system. The platform includes our proprietary tokenization technology, and is designed to provide easy integration with, and access to, Trust Stamp s products, chargeable on a per use basis. The Orchestration Layer facilitates no-code and low-code implementations, making adoption faster and even more cost-effective for a broader range of potential customers. It is expected to accelerate the Company s evolution, from being exclusively a custom solutions provider, to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. Competition We can work with any identity data from any source, potentially breaking vendor and modality lock-in, but our primary market target is the biometric service industry, which is growing exponentially while being threatened by a consumer, media, and legislative backlash against storing biometric data. The IT 2 can potentially be overlaid on any biometric or other identity data provider. In general, we compete for customer budget with any company in the identity authentication industry, and our business plan calls for our capturing a fraction of one percent (1 of the projected expenditure for biometric authentication services. Major competitors in this space include companies such as NEXT Biometrics, IDEMIA, Synaptics, Cognitec, Innovatrics, Suprema, FaceTec, Rank One Computing, Acuant, Jumio, Onfido and Mitek. However, we believe that, due to the uniqueness of our technology solution, the Company does not currently have any direct competitors for the core IT 2 solutions upon which the growth in our business plan is focused. The commercial advantage of our solution is our ability to work across providers and modalities and we continue to pursue a first-mover advantage including our global scale partnership which is achieving a network effect in the global Humanitarian and Development market. We believe that this combination will make it unattractive for a potential competitor to replicate the 6-years and multi-million dollars, that we have already expended, to try and circumvent our multiple (and continuing) patent filings and/or offer a parallel product based upon a different technology. We believe that given sufficient time and resources, we can augment any biometric modalities including face, hand, iris, voice, gait, and behavior, together with any other identifying data which places us in a unique position versus providers of biometric services. We are unaware of any other provider being able to offer or support a proliferation of authentication modalities in this fashion, and therefore we believe there are no other companies that directly compete with us in this space. If our go-to-market strategy is successful, biometric service providers can be a channel distributer, and not necessarily a competitor. Growth Strategy Our business plan calls for our capturing a small fraction of one percent (1 of the projected expenditure for biometric authentication services. Our strategy in this respect is to: o Expand the scope and range of services that we provide to and through our existing clients o Continue to add significant new clients for our current and future services o Offer our services via channel partners with substantial distribution networks o Offer our technology on a low code basis, providing access via an orchestration layer and/or open-APIs to enable implementation by a broader range of clients o The addition of alternate authentication tools including non-facial-biometric options and non-biometric-knowledge and device-based tools facilitating two and multi-factor authentication

We use an outsourcing company, 10Clouds, for additional development staff as needed. 10Clouds is considered a related party. In addition, we also utilize SourceFit, a company in the Philippines, for PEO services, representing approximately 2 of our operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022. Amazon Web Services provides cloud hosting and processing services, representing approximately 2-3 of our operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022. Key Customers Historically, the Company generated most of its income through a relationship with an S P 500 bank, in which services were provided pursuant to a Master Software Agreement and statements of work. The scope of services provided to the S P 500 bank has grown throughout the relationship and additional growth has been seen in 2021 and 2022. In recent years, the Company has also expanded its customer base to include relationships with Mastercard International Mastercard ), Fidelity Information Services, LLC FIS ), and other customers. With respect to FIS, we continued to expand our work with our proprietary tokenization technology being utilized in FIS new global identity authentication system. In 2022, the Company implemented its Orchestration Layer platform a low-code platform solution which streamlines delivery and implementation of the Company s technologies. In the third quarter 2022, the Company acquired its first 2 customers on the Orchestration Layer platform through its partnership with FIS. In the fourth quarter, 4 additional customers onboarded, then 17 new customers since year-end, totaling to 23 total customers on the Orchestration Layer platform all related to FIS, including 23 financial institutions with over 50 billion in assets, as of February 2023. The Orchestration Layer platform is designed to be a one-stop shop for Trust Stamp services and provides for easy integration to our products; chargeable on a per-use basis and is accelerating the Company s evolution from being exclusively a custom solutions provider to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. The Orchestration Layer utilizes the Company s next-generation identity package, offering rapid deployment across devices and platforms, with custom workflows that seamlessly orchestrate trust across the identity lifecycle for a consistent user experience in processes for onboarding and KYC/AML, multi-factor authentication, account recovery, fraud prevention, compliance, and more. The Orchestration Layer that has been developed facilitates no-code and low-code implementations of the Company s technology making adoption faster and even more cost-effective for a broader range of potential customers.

 Under a ten-year technology services agreement the TSA with Mastercard International entered into in March 2019, the Company s IT 2 technology is being implemented by Mastercard for Humanitarian Development purposes as a core element of its Community Pass and Inclusive Identity offerings. Use cases include not only financial services for individuals and businesses but also empowering people and communities to meet basic needs, such as nutritious food, clean water, housing, education, and healthcare including Ethiopia s implementation of Mastercard s Wellness Pass within Ethiopia s health information system to promote efficiency in healthcare tracking and offline portability of health records. Under the TSA, the Company is paid to develop and host software solutions utilizing the IT2 and to support Mastercard s implementations. In addition, the Company is paid on a per use basis for all transactions utilizing its technology. To date the Company has received guaranteed minimum annual payments on account of usage. In December of 2022, the Company entered into a modification of the agreed pricing schedule with Mastercard to move from a per-use to a per-user-year model to broaden the range of potential use cases. Under that agreement, Trust Stamp currently receives minimum annual payments on account of usage, and we anticipate use-based revenue starting in 2023 and growing year-on-year thereafter. The TSA may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured within thirty days after notice is received of such a breach. Either party may terminate the TSA if the other party becomes, including but not limited to, insolvent, subject to a bankruptcy, dissolved or liquidated. Unless the TSA is terminated, the TSA will automatically renew for additional one year-periods unless either party provides written notice within ninety days of intent not to renew. As a result of investments in new business development staff and systems, as well as the introduction and expansion of the customer relationships described above, and while we value the relationship highly, management believes that we are no longer financially dependent on our relationship with the S P 500 bank. As an example, the S P 500 bank and Mastercard made up 33.6 of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 46.3 of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 23, 2021, the Company was awarded a 3,920,764 contract (the ICE Contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE ), a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This engagement required an investment in productization, business development, and satisfying extensive due diligence processes. Effective March 27, 2022, Trust Stamp agreed to a bilateral modification of the fixed price purchase order announced in September 2021 with ICE. The modification covered software development and services related to rapid enrolment in the ICE alternative to detention program and, increased the total contract award value to 7,176,364 from the original 3,920,764. On August 17, 2022, Trust Stamp received notification from ICE that it was terminating the ICE Contract for convenience effective immediately. ICE has paid Trust Stamp for the ICE Contract services performed prior to the amendment effective April 15, 2022. Additionally, Trust Stamp received 720 thousand in cancellation expenses incurred during the period between April 15, 2022 and August 17, 2022 for mobile service expense, storage expense, and payroll expense. On September 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement the MSA with Innovative Government Solutions IGS under which the Company and IGS will jointly offer services and IGS is granted a 12-year (renewable) license the license to resell the Company s technology subject to payment by IGS of agreed revenue advances and end user license fees. On execution of the MSA, IGS agrees to pay 1,500,000 to the Company as a non-refundable revenue advance, an additional 1,500,000 non-refundable revenue advance on the first anniversary of the MSA, and 1,000,000 on each of the next two anniversaries of the MSA as additional non-refundable revenue advances. In February 2023, IGS agreed to pre-pay 750,000 of the first anniversary payment and payment is expected in March of 2023. IGS has the right to terminate the MSA for convenience before the additional non-refundable revenue advances become due in which case the unpaid additional non-refundable revenue advances will not be payable and the license will terminate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Trust Stamp received the initial 1.5 million payment, recorded the non-refundable revenue advance to deferred revenue, and recognized no IGS revenue. As we grow, we intend to continue to expand the number of customers from which we generate revenues including through the development of channel partnerships, such as our relationship with FIS. In the opinion of our management, we would be able to continue operations without our current customers (including our channel partnership with FIS). However, the unanticipated loss of the Company s current customers could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position. Regulation Our business is not currently subject to any licensing requirements in any jurisdiction in which we operate, other than the requirement to hold a business license in the City of Atlanta (with which we are in compliance), and the requirement to hold a trading license in Rwanda (with which we are in compliance). This does not mean that licensing requirements may not be introduced in one or more jurisdiction in which we operate, and such requirements could be burdensome and/or expensive or even impose requirements that we are unable to meet.

 We are subject to substantial governmental regulation relating to our technology and will continue to be for the lifetime of our Company. By virtue of handling sensitive PII and biometric data, we are subject to numerous statutes related to data privacy, and additional legislation and regulation should be anticipated in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Example federal (US) and European statutes we could be subject to are: o Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) o Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) o The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) o ePrivacy Privacy Directive o The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) o The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) o Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) 
 HIPAA and HITECH Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA ), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH ), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information PHI ), used or disclosed by covered entities and business associates. Covered entities and business associates are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. Our subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, transmit, or otherwise process PHI on behalf of us are HIPAA business associates and must also comply with HIPAA as a business associate. HIPAA and HITECH include privacy and security rules, breach notification requirements, and electronic transaction standards. The privacy rules cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and business associates. The privacy rules generally prohibit the use or disclosure of PHI, except as permitted under certain limited circumstances. The privacy rules also set forth individual patient rights, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her PHI. The security rules require covered entities and business associates to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically transmitted or stored PHI by implementing administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Under HITECH s Breach Notification Rule, a covered entity must notify individuals, the Secretary of the HHS, and in some circumstances, the media of breaches of unsecured PHI. In addition, we may be subject to state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a failure to secure PHI, a complaint about our privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties and additional reporting and oversight obligations if such entities are required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. GDPR The EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to implement more stringent operational

 requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, transparent and expanded disclosure to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) about how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements, and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR will be significant the greater of 20 million or 4 of global turnover. The GDPR provides that EU member states may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. ePrivacy Directive The ePrivacy directive sets out the rules relating to the processing of personal data across public communications networks. This directive requires business to ensure consent requests are made and that consent is received from the user before the use of cookies is made. Businesses must communicate the privacy rules with accurate and specific information regarding the data contained in the cookie. Information must be communicated before the consent requests are made, in plain language. Organizations must ensure that users are able to withdraw consent in the same simple manner as the initial consent request. CRPA and CCPA The CRPA and CCPA define and establish various rights that consumers residing in California have over the privacy of their data along with the responsibilities of businesses when collecting personal information. It requires businesses that control the collection of consumers personal information to inform them of the category, purpose and duration the business intends to retain such information. It lists the consumers right to correct their data and have their data deleted. Customers may also exercise their right to limit the sale or sharing of their personal or sensitive personal information. Fines for non-compliance can range from 100 to 750 per consumer per incident. Additionally, in certain cases the California Privacy Protection Agency may impose administrative fines ranging from 2,500 to 7,500 for each violation. BIPA BIPA, which was enacted in 2008, addresses the collection, use and retention of biometric information by private entities. Under the law, a private entity must inform an individual, or their legally authorized individual, that the biometric information is being collected and stored, and the specific purpose and the length of time for the collection, storage and use of the biometric information, before obtaining or possessing their biometric information for the purposes of capturing, storing or sharing it. In addition, prior to collecting any biometric information, the regulation required businesses to obtain a written release for the collection of the biometric information from the individual, or the individual s legally authorized representative after notice has been given. BIPA provides statutory damages of up to 1,000 for each negligent violation, and up to 5,000 for each intentional or reckless violation.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors The SEC requires the Company to identify risks that are specific to its business and its financial condition. The Company is still subject to all the same risks that all companies in its business, and all companies in the economy, are exposed to. These include risks relating to economic downturns, political and economic events, and technological developments (such as cyber-attacks and the ability to prevent such attacks). Additionally, early-stage companies are inherently riskier than more developed companies, and the risk of business failure and complete loss of your investment capital is present. You should consider general risks as well as specific risks when deciding whether to invest. Below is a summary of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: We are a comparatively early-stage company that has incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Our technology continues to be developed, and there is no guarantee that we will ever successfully develop the technology that is essential to our business to a point at which no further development is needed. We may be subject to numerous data protection requirements and regulations. We operate in a highly competitive industry that is dominated by a number of exceptionally large, well-capitalized market leaders and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can. We rely on third parties to provide services essential to the success of our business. We currently have three customers that account for substantially all of our revenues. We expect to raise additional capital through equity and/or debt offerings to support our working capital requirements and operating losses. Our auditor has included an Emphasis of Matter Regarding Liquidity note in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As the vast majority of our revenue is US Dollar denominated and a significant percentage of our expenses are incurred in other currencies, we are subject to risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Risks Related to Our Company We have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our performance and have not yet generated profits. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any new company encounters. Our Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 11, 2016, and we have not yet generated profits. The likelihood of our creation of a viable business must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the growth of a business, operation in a competitive industry, and the continued development of our technology and products. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for the near future, and there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the near future. You should consider our business, operations, and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges faced as an emerging growth company. We have historically operated at a loss, which has resulted in an accumulated deficit. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of 12.09 million, compared to a net loss of 9.06 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability. Even if we do, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to do so would continue to have a material adverse effect on our accumulated deficit, would affect our cash flows, would affect our efforts to raise capital and is likely to result in a decline in our Class A Common Stock price.

Table of Contents 
 Our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis. We have not yet generated profits and have an accumulated deficit of 39.30 million as of December 31, 2022. We may not have enough funds to sustain the business until it becomes profitable. Even if we raise additional funding through future financing efforts, we may not accurately anticipate how quickly we may use such funds and whether such funds would be sufficient to bring the business to profitability. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date of the consolidated financial statements is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results. Our cash could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fail. The Company maintains domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banks. The domestic bank deposit balances may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. In addition, given the foreign markets we serve, we maintain cash deposits in foreign banks, some of which are not insured or partially insured by the FDIC or other similar agency. These balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions in which we deposit monies fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed and was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The Company held 85,668 in excess of federally insured limits with Silicon Valley Bank as of March 10, 2023. As of March 14, 2023, the Company had access to all of its money held at Silicon Valley Bank. Our technology continues to be developed, and it is unlikely that we will ever develop our technology to a point at which no further development is required. Trust Stamp is developing complex technology that requires significant technical and regulatory expertise to develop, commercialize and update to meet evolving market and regulatory requirements. While we constantly monitor and adapt our products and technology as criminal methods of breaching cybersecurity advance, there is no guarantee we will consistently be able to develop technology that can effectively counteract such criminal efforts. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize our technology and products, it will significantly affect our viability as a company. If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to individually identifiable biometric or other personally identifiable information is otherwise obtained, our reputation may be harmed, and we may incur significant liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, we may collect and store sensitive data, including protected health information PHI ), personally identifiable information PII ), owned or controlled by ourselves or our customers, and other parties. We communicate sensitive data, including patient data, electronically, and through relationships with multiple third-party vendors and their subcontractors. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information, including research and development information, patient data, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face a number of risks relative to protecting this critical information, including loss of access risk, inappropriate use or disclosure, inappropriate modification, and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor, audit, and modify our controls over our critical information. This risk extends to the third-party vendors and subcontractors we use to manage this sensitive data. As a custodian of this data, Trust Stamp therefore inherits responsibilities related to this data, exposing itself to potential threats. Data breaches occur at all levels of corporate sophistication (including at companies with significantly greater resources and security measures than our own) and the resulting fallout stemming from these breaches can be costly, time-consuming, and damaging to a company s reputation. Further, data breaches need not occur from malicious attack or phishing only. Often, employee carelessness can result in sharing PII with a much wider audience than intended. Consequences of such data breaches could result in fines, litigation expenses, costs of implementing better systems, and the damage of negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. We are subject to substantial governmental regulation relating to our technology and will continue to be for the lifetime of our Company. By virtue of handling sensitive PII and biometric data, we are subject to numerous statutes related to data privacy and additional legislation and regulation should be anticipated in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Examples of federal (US) and European statutes we could be subject to are: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)

 Any such access, breach, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under federal or state laws that protect the privacy of personal information under HIPAA and/or HITECH . Notice of breaches must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services HHS ), and for extensive breaches, notice may need to be made to the media or state attorneys general. Penalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly, and include significant civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to 250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to 50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. Further, various states, such as California, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to 250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and data we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as PII or PHI, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our services, decrease demand for our services, reduce our revenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities. Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Moreover, complying with these various laws could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. We rely on our customers to obtain valid and appropriate consents from data subjects whose biometric samples and data we process on such customers behalf. Given that we do not obtain direct consent from such data subjects and we do not audit our customers to ensure that they have obtained the necessary consents required by law, the failure of our customers to obtain consents that are in compliance with applicable law could result in our own non-compliance with privacy laws. Such failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Claims that we have violated individuals privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, could result in adverse publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate sustaining operating losses for the foreseeable future. It is anticipated that we will sustain operating losses into 2023 as we continue with research and development, and strive to gain new customers for our technology and market share in our industry. Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to expand our customer base, consisting of companies willing to license our technology. There can be no assurance that this will occur. Unanticipated problems and expenses are often encountered in offering new products which may impact whether the Company is successful. Furthermore, we may encounter substantial delays and unexpected expenses related to development, technological changes, marketing, regulatory requirements and changes to such requirements or other unforeseen difficulties. There can be no assurance that we will ever become profitable. If the Company sustains losses over an extended period of time, it may be unable to continue in business. If our products do not achieve broad acceptance both domestically and internationally, we will not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth. Our revenues are derived from licensing our identity authentication solutions. We cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the size of the market for our technology. The expansion of the market for our solutions depends on a number of factors, such as the cost, performance and reliability of our solutions and the products and services offered by our competitors; customers perceptions regarding the benefits of biometrics and other authentication solutions; 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 public perceptions regarding the intrusiveness of these solutions and the manner in which organizations use biometric and other identity information collected; public perceptions regarding the confidentiality of private information; proposed or enacted legislation related to privacy of information customers satisfaction with biometrics solutions; and marketing efforts and publicity regarding biometrics solutions. 
 Even if our technology gains wide market acceptance, our solutions may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue to gain market acceptance. If authentication solutions generally or our solutions specifically do not gain wide market acceptance, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our revenues and results of operations would suffer. We operate in a highly competitive industry that is dominated by multiple very large, well-capitalized market leaders and is constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions, or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us. The level of competition in the identity authentication industry is high, with multiple exceptionally large, well-capitalized competitors holding a majority share of the market. Currently, we are not aware of any direct competitors of the Company able to offer our main technological offering. Nonetheless, many of the companies in the identity authentication market have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, significantly greater financial, technological, sales, marketing, and other resources than we do. At any point, these companies may decide to devote their resources to creating a competing technology solution which will impact our ability to maintain or gain market share in this industry. Further, such companies will be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements, more quickly develop new products or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Likewise, their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the identity management solutions industry and compete more effectively on the basis of price and production. In addition, new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the identity management solutions industry. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including the type and quality of our products and the strength of our brand names, as well as many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of new products, any of which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We face competition from companies with greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources, and, if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors, our market share may decline, and our business could be harmed . We face competition from well established companies. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, significantly greater financial, technological, sales, marketing, and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements, more quickly develop new products or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Likewise, their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the identity management solutions industry and compete more effectively on the basis of price and production.

 The Company may be unable to effectively protect its intellectual property. To date, the Company has been issued thirteen patents related to its products and technology in the current year. The Company has many more pending patent applications as of December, 31, 2022. There is no guarantee that the Company will ever be issued patents on the applications it has submitted. In addition, in order to control costs, we have filed patent applications only in the United States. This may result in our having limited or no protection in other jurisdictions. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our products and technology. If we are unable to secure patents for our products and technology, or are otherwise are unsuccessful at protecting our technology, other companies with greater resources may copy our technology and/or products, or improve upon them, putting us at a disadvantage to our competitors. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. We believe our products and technology may be highly disruptive to a very large and growing market. Our competitors are well capitalized with significant intellectual property protection and resources and they (and/or patent trolls) may initiate infringement lawsuits against our Company. Such litigation could be expensive and could also prevent us from selling our products, which would significantly harm our ability to grow our business as planned. Our failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business. As the Company grows, it will be required to hire and attract additional qualified professionals, additional staff for research and development, regulatory professionals, sales and marketing professionals, accounting, legal, and finance experts. The Company may not be able to locate or attract qualified individuals for such positions, which will affect the Company s ability to grow and expand its business. We rely on third party service providers . Our third-party partners provide a variety of essential business functions, including hosting, contract labor, and others. It is possible that some of these third parties will fail to perform their services or will perform them in an unacceptable manner. If we encounter problems with one or more of these parties and they fail to perform to expectations, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company. We currently have three customers that account for substantially all of our current revenues . During the Company s development, we have focused on developing strong relationships with a few significant partners and customers. As such, our historical financial results identify that for a number of years we generated substantially all of our revenue from two customers which increased to three customers in 2021 with the addition of the ICE Contract, which ended in August of 2022. In September of 2022, we entered into a long-term technology contract with a new customer restoring the number of significant revenue-generating customers to three as December 31, 2022. In the opinion of our management, we would be able to continue operations without our current customers. However, the unanticipated loss of the Company s current customers could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position. We face risks related to distributing our products and services through channel partnerships, such as our partnership with FIS. When selling our products and services through indirect sales channels, such as through FIS, we are reliant on the efforts of those channel partners to successfully market and sell our products to end-customers. To the extent that FIS is unsuccessful at selling our products and services, our results of operations may suffer. Further, as of the date of this report, our only channel partnership is with FIS, which may increase the risk of harm to our Company if FIS is unsuccessful in selling our products and services. While we may seek to attract and retain additional indirect channel partners that will be able to market our products effectively and provide timely and cost-effective customer support and services, we may not succeed in doing so, and this could limit our ability to grow revenues and achieve profitability. Selling through channel partnerships is also a relatively new endeavor for us. Historically, we have generated a majority of sales through direct sales. Managing indirect sales channels may require more management attention than managing our direct sales force. If the indirect sales channels grow, management attention may be diverted, impairing our ability to execute other parts of our strategy. We face risks related to our target customers. The majority of the customers that we are targeting are large organizations with complex and expansive operations. These kinds of companies often have long and often unpredictable enterprise sales cycles, which can result in significant time and effort to close a deal with those companies (which there is no guarantee that a deal will occur). This can make sales forecasting difficult for our Company, which can lead to operational challenges. For example, we often need to hire staff ahead of closing on a new client contract to be ready to perform if and when the contract closes. If we are unable to effectively forecast sales, we may incur unnecessary or avoidable expenses, or exhaust our cash reserves, which could have a material negative impact on our Company s financial condition and results of operations.

 Our future success is dependent on the continued service of our small management team. Seven directors and four executive officers provide leadership to Trust Stamp. Four of the directors are also executive officers. Our success is dependent on their ability to manage all aspects of our business effectively. Because we are relying on our small management team, we lack certain business development resources that may hurt our ability to grow our business. Any loss of key members of our executive team could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. We do not maintain a key person life insurance policy on any of the members of our senior management team. As a result, we would have no way to cover the financial loss if we were to lose the services of our directors or officers. We expect to raise additional capital through equity and/or debt offerings to support our working capital requirements and operating losses . In order to fund future growth and development, the Company will likely need to raise additional funds in the future by offering shares of its Common or Preferred Stock and/or other classes of equity, or debt that convert into shares of common or Preferred Stock, any of which offerings would dilute the ownership percentage of investors in this offering. In order to issue sufficient shares in this regard, we may be required to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock, which would be require us to obtain consent of a majority of our shareholders. Furthermore, if the Company raises capital through debt, the holders of our debt would have priority over holders of common and Preferred Stock and the Company may be required to accept terms that restrict its ability to incur more debt. We cannot assure you that the necessary funds will be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, or that such funds if raised, would be sufficient. The level and timing of future expenditure will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. If we are not able to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to curtail or abandon our growth plans, which could adversely impact the Company, its business, development, financial condition, operating results, or prospects. We are and may continue to be significantly impacted by the worldwide economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has spread to many countries, including the United States, and was declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified and the U.S., Europe and Asia have implemented severe travel restrictions and social distancing. The impacts of the outbreak are unknown and rapidly evolving. A widespread health crisis has adversely affected and could continue to affect the global economy, resulting in an economic downturn that could negatively impact the operations of the Company, which could negatively impact your investment in our securities. The continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause a further economic slowdown or recession or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19 affects our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak has had and may continue to have indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 or any other pandemic harms the global economy generally. We are subject to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. We operate on a global basis. We have operations (through our subsidiaries and/or directly) in many foreign countries and territories, including, but not limited to, United Kingdom, Poland, Rwanda, Denmark and the Republic of Malta. The translation from any currencies to United States Dollars for financial statement presentation resulted in a foreign currency loss of 105 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 183 thousand loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such foreign currency translation losses, coupled with varying inflation rates across the countries we operate in, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 We are an emerging growth company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and an exemption from compliance with the requirement of the PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on the financial statements. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the year in which we completed our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which requires the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates to exceed 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on the reporting exemptions and the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. If some investors find our Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and our share price may be more volatile. We have failed to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as is required for a public company. We may be unable to prevent error or fraud, which may materially misstate the financials. As provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we previously did not establish effective internal controls over financial accounting and reporting. The resulting material weaknesses related to certain corporate finance and accounting oversight functions over the detection of errors that were present within the Company s calculation of stock-based awards as well as the financial reporting close process. The failure to establish effective internal controls left us without the ability to properly account for important transactions accurately, to reliably compile our financial information, and significantly impaired our ability to prevent error and detect fraud. In response to these identified material weaknesses, the Company has established additional operational processes to prevent the incorrect recording of stock-based awards. Such additional operational processes that have been established include, but are not limited to: Calculation of Stock-Based Awards Established multiple layers of reviews of equity awards calculations to ensure that the calculations match the terms in corresponding award agreement and formulas are correct. Regular check between our legal and accounting staff to ensure that new award agreement do not go unaccounted for. On a monthly basis, we also review all active agreements to check for expirations, so that they are properly accounted for and recorded. Perform regular reconciliations between information in our internal records and our transfer agent s records to ensure that issued shares and warrants are captured accurately. Implemented multiple tiers of checks and reviews between data entry in our internal records and the use of such data to calculate stock-based compensation entries for our financial statements. 
 During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 the Company s management tested the effectiveness of the recently implemented internal control processes adopted in response to the identified material weaknesses specifically related to stock-based compensation

 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and believes that such measures were effective at remediating the material weaknesses specifically related to stock-based compensation described above Management identified certain material weaknesses relating to corporate finance and accounting, resulting in the Company not maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the year ended December 31, 2022. Management identified certain material weaknesses relating to corporate finance and accounting, resulting in the Company not maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company has not maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as required for a public company. The resulting material weaknesses relate to insufficient management review and approval of each journal entry prior to its posting for preparation of the financial statements and disclosures. Additionally, it was concluded that we had inadequate controls over the management information systems related to program changes, segregation of duties, and access controls. As a result, it would be possible that the Company s business process controls that depend on the accuracy and completeness of data or financial reports generated by these information technology systems could be adversely affected due to the lack of operating effectiveness of information technology controls. The failure to establish effective internal controls could result in improperly accounting for transactions accurately, reliability in compiling financial information, and could significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company contracts for use of office space at 3017 Bolling Way NE, Floors 1 and 2, Atlanta, Georgia, 30305, United States of America, which serves as its corporate headquarters and primary operational hub. The Company also leases office space (through a subsidiary) in Malta, which primarily serves as a research and development space. The Company contracts for coworking arrangements in other office spaces (either directly or through its subsidiaries) in New York, North Carolina, Denmark, Poland, and Rwanda to support its dispersed workforce. Minimum lease commitments related to these agreements are described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements provided under Item 8 of this report. We believe our existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of our business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is not currently involved in any litigation, and its management is not aware of any pending or threatened legal actions relating to its intellectual property, conduct of its business activities, or otherwise. See Risk Factors for a summary of risks our Company may face in relation to litigation against our Company. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Common Stock Currently, our Class A Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol IDAI . During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 30, 2021, our Class A Common Stock was traded on the OTC Markets Group Inc. s OTCQX quotation platform under the trading symbol IDAI and on the Euronext Growth market in Dublin under AIID . However, Trust Stamp received approval from Nasdaq to have our Class A Common Stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol IDAI with trading commencing on January 31, 2022. As a result of our Nasdaq approval, our Class A Common Stock is no longer listed on the OTCQX market as of January 31, 2022. Holders As of March 29, 2023, there were approximately 2,834 registered holders of record of our Class A Common Stock and the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq was 2.45 per share on March 29, 2023. The number of shares of our Class A Common Stock that are freely tradeable as of March 29, 2023 was 2,291,567. Performance Graph We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Dividend Policy To date, we have not paid any dividends on our Class A Common Stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of dividends on the Class A Common Stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, or such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We currently expect to use all available funds to finance the future development and expansion of our business. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans On April 9, 2019, management created a new entity, TStamp Incentive Holdings TSIH to which the Company issued 320,513 shares of Class A Common Stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Split) that the Board of Directors of TSIH could use for employee stock awards in the future. As of December 31, 2022, 56,513 (after giving effect to the Reverse Split) of these shares were outstanding and remained available for issuance. The purpose of the entity was to provide an analogous structure to a traditional stock incentive plan. Any equity compensation approved by the Company would be issued by TSIH. All of these shares of Class A Common Stock have been allocated for issuance pursuant to RSUs that vested on January 2, 2023. The Company expects to adopt another equity compensation plan in the near future but has not yet done so as of December 31, 2022.

Overview T Stamp Inc. was incorporated on April 11, 2016 in the State of Delaware. T Stamp Inc. and its subsidiaries Trust Stamp , we , or the Company develops and markets identity authentication software for enterprise and government partners and peer-to-peer markets. Trust Stamp develops proprietary artificial intelligence-powered identity and trust solutions at the intersection of biometrics, privacy, and cybersecurity, that enable organizations to protect themselves and their users, while empowering individuals to retain ownership of their identity data and prevent fraudulent activity using their identity. Recent Developments Development of Orchestration Layer and Channel Partnership with FIS During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to expand our work with Fidelity Information Services, LLC FIS with our proprietary tokenization technology being utilized in FIS new global identity authentication system. In 2022, the Company implemented its Orchestration Layer platform a low-code platform solution which streamlines delivery and implementation of the Company s technologies. In the third quarter 2022, the Company acquired its first 2 customers on the Orchestration Layer platform through its partnership with FIS. In the fourth quarter, 4 additional customers onboarded, then 17 new customers since year-end, totaling to 23 total customers on the Orchestration Layer platform all related to FIS, including 23 financial institutions with over 50 billion in assets, as of February 2023. The Orchestration Layer platform is designed to be a one-stop shop for Trust Stamp services and provides for easy integration to our products; chargeable on a per-use basis and is accelerating the Company s evolution from being exclusively a custom solutions provider to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. Additionally, the Orchestration Layer reduces customer acquisition costs through channel partnership and its easy-to-integrate delivery model. Channel partnerships, such as the one mentioned with FIS, enables the Company to leverage the sales and marketing resources of larger, more established organizations, who are selling this Orchestration Layer platform to their existing customer base, which can number in the tens of thousands. The cost to acquire an additional customer through channel partnerships are relatively much lower than the costs through traditional direct selling and other sales models and can accelerate the delivery of the platform. Finally, the easy-to-integrate delivery model enables customers to progress through the customer lifecycle at a much more rapid pace, from introduction, to demonstration, and finally, integration of the platform in a matter of weeks versus typically many months for fully customized solutions which often require several development cycles and additional resources to produce and integrate the final product with the client s systems. Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. Financing On September 11, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Armistice Capital Fund Ltd. Armistice ). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company sold to Armistice in a private placement (the Private Placement 195,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 390,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company (the Warrants for a total purchase price of 1,511,250.

 The Warrants have an exercise price of 8.85 per share, with such exercise price being subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the Class A Common Stock that occur while the Warrants are outstanding. The Warrants also allow for a cashless exercise if, at any time after the six (6) month anniversary of the issue date of the Warrants there is no effective registration statement registering the resale of the Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Warrants. In such a case, then Warrants may also be exercised, in whole or in part, by means of a cashless exercise in which the Selling Stockholder will be entitled to receive a number of shares of Class A Common Stock as described in the Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised at any time by the Selling Stockholder starting on the issuance date (i.e. September 14, 2022) until the five (5) year and six (6) month anniversary thereafter. Additionally, pursuant to the SPA, the Company agreed to provide the Selling Stockholder a right of participation in any subsequent financings of the Company from the date of the Closing until the date that is 18 months thereafter in which the Company issues shares of its common stock (or common stock equivalents). In such an event, the Selling Stockholder will have the right to participate that financing in up to an amount equal to 30 of the amount raised in that financing on the same terms, conditions and price provided to other investors in the financing. The Closing of the SPA was subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the Company s entry into a Registration Rights Agreement and the Company s officers and directors entering into Lock-Up Agreements, the execution of which were conditions to the Closing of the SPA. On September 14, 2022 (the Closing Date ), the Closing of the SPA occurred. The Private Placement also closed on the Closing Date, whereby the Selling Stockholder purchased 195,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from the Company at a purchase price of 7.75 per share, and the Company issued the Selling Stockholder the Warrants to purchase 390,000 shares of Class A Common Stock on the Closing Date. The Company received gross proceeds from the Private Placement of 1,511,250 before deducting offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Private Placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company engaged Maxim Group LLC Maxim as the Company s placement agent for the Private Placement pursuant to a Placement Agent Agreement dated as of September 11, 2022. Pursuant to the Placement Agent Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Maxim a cash placement fee equal to 6.0 of the gross proceeds of the Private Placement, plus reimbursement of certain expenses and legal fees. Registration Rights Agreement Pursuant to the SPA, the Company agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with the Selling Stockholder, pursuant to which the Company must file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or, if the Company is ineligible to use a Form S-3, another appropriate form) with the SEC to register for resale the 195,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the SPA, as well as the 390,000 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants within 15 days of the Closing of the SPA, with such registration statement becoming effective within 45 days after the Closing, subject to adjustment in the event of a review by the SEC. The Company is subject to customary penalties and liquidated damages in the event it does not meet certain filing requirements and deadlines set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company entered into the Registration Rights Agreement on September 11, 2022. The Company filed such a registration statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by the SEC on January 26, 2023. No sales have been made to date under the registration statement by Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. We note that, as of March 29, 2023, our Class A Common Stock is trading at 2.45 per share. As such, unless the trading price of our Class A Common Stock significantly increases, it is unlikely the Warrants will be exercised.

 Lock-Up Agreements Pursuant to the SPA, the Company agreed to enter into lock-up agreements (collectively the Lock-Up Agreements with our executive officers and directors at the Closing. Under the Lock-Up Agreements, our executive officers and directors may not offer, sell, contract to sell, lend, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise dispose of all shares of the Company s Common Stock beneficially owned by them for a period of sixty (60) after the effective date of the registration statement contemplated in the Registration Rights Agreement. On the Closing Date, each of the Company s executive officers and directors entered into Lock-Up Agreements. The descriptions of each of the SPA, Warrants, Registration Rights Agreement, Placement Agent Agreement, and Form of Lock-Up Agreement are qualified by reference to the copies of these agreements included as Exhibits to this report. Reverse Split Pursuant to the Reverse Split, as of March 23, 2023, every five (5) outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock was combined and became one (1) share of Class A Common Stock, rounding up to the nearest whole number of shares. Prior to the Reverse Split, the Company had 25,584,242 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and 24,271,512 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. Immediately following the Reverse Split the Company has approximately 5,116,878 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and 4,854,332 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding (giving effect to rounding for fractional shares). The par value of the Class A Common Stock was not changed nor were the number of authorized shares reduced in connection with the Reverse Split. The Board determined that the availability of additional shares was necessary to consummate future financing transactions. The availability of additional shares will also permit the Board to issue shares, or instruments convertible into or exercisable for such shares, for general corporate purposes. The Reverse Split was in the same ratio for all shares of Class A Common Stock. All holders of Class A Common Stock were affected uniformly by the Reverse Split, resulting in no effect on the proportionate holdings of any of our stockholders, except for possible changes due to the treatment of fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company rounded up in the event a stockholder was entitled to receive less than one share of Class A Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Split. In addition, the split did not affect any holder of Class A Common Stock s proportionate voting power (subject to the treatment of fractional shares), and all shares of Class A Common Stock remained fully paid and non-assessable. The Reverse Split was made effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with an effective date of March 23, 2023. The following chart reflects the changes in our capital structure following the Reverse Split, the top row reflecting the pre-split capital structure and the bottom row reflecting the post-split capital structure: 

Authorized Shares of Issued Outstanding Reserved Available for Class A Common Stock Shares Shares but Unissued Issuance 50,000,000 25,584,242 24,271,512 10,707,081 13,708,677 50,000,000 5,116,878 4,854,332 2,141,417 42,741,734 

 The Company rounded up in the event a stockholder was entitled to receive less than one share of Class A Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Split. Key Business Measures In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions.

 Adjusted EBITDA This discussion includes information about Adjusted EBITDA that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents U.S. GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) impairment in assets and liabilities, and (6) certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our Company and our management, and it will be a focus as we invest in and grow the business. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: o Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. o Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs. o Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. o Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of certain charges or gains resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. 
 Due to these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement to our U.S. GAAP results. Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA

The overall increase in adjusted EBITDA loss is due to the 3.01 million increase in Net loss before taxes during the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as a decrease in Stock-based compensation of 382 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Results of Operations below for further discussion on the drivers behind the increase in Net loss and selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Components of Results of Operations Net revenue We derive our revenue primarily from professional services. Most of the revenue is derived from the pilot contract and renewal with ICE which amounts to 3.29 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, during the year, the Company launched its SaaS platform called Orchestration Layer platform, which is being utilized in FIS new global identity authentication system, which includes the Company s proprietary tokenization technology, and facilitates no-code and low-code implementations, making adoption faster and even more cost-effective for a broader range of potential customers. The Company expects this platform to accelerate its evolution, from being exclusively a custom solutions provider, to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. Cost of services provided Cost of services provided generally consists of the cost of hosting fees and cost of labor associated with professional services rendered. Depreciation and amortization expense is not included in cost of services provided. Further, several projects that were originally in the research and development stage became feasible projects, shifting the allocation of cost from research and development, into cost of services provided in the current year as client specific products were implemented using the technologies. This increase of expense allocation is a result of our prior decision to invest more money in research and development in prior periods and our goal of accelerating our product roadmap coming to fruition. We expect that cost of services provided will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue grows and will vary from period-to-period as a percentage of revenue. Research and development Research and development expenses R D consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits. Personnel costs are allocated to R D for time spent working on the preliminary project stage and post-implementation maintenance as well as time spent on bug fixes associated with internal-use software activities, front-end application development in which technological feasibility has not been established, and services rendered to customers under funded software-development arrangements. We plan to continue to invest in personnel to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to support these activities. Selling, general, and administrative Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses were generally composed of payroll, legal, and professional fees, including an increase in sales commission expense incurred because of new statements of work. We expect that the sales and marketing expenses within the SG A expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our potential and current customers, in growing our business and enhancing our brand awareness. Depreciation and amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a continued investment in internally developed software which will be used for future productization. Interest income (expense) Interest income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense accrued on a promissory note payable. Additionally, the Company earned interest income in the form of cash back by using its corporate line of credit.

 Impairment of digital assets Digital assets consists primarily of Metapresence Land and Cryptocurrency. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time after their acquisition requires recognition of impairment. Grant income The Company had grant income primarily related to Trust Stamp Malta s agreements with Republic of Malta. During July 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Republic of Malta that would provide for a grant of up to 200 thousand or 215 thousand as reimbursement for operating expenses over the first 12 months following incorporation in the Republic of Malta. The Company was required to provide an initial capital amount of 50 thousand or 54 thousand, which is matched with a 50 thousand grant or 54 thousand. Other income Other income is mainly driven by miscellaneous income earned that is unrelated to the main focus of the Company s business. Other expense Other expense is mainly driven by the fact that the Company operates in multiple countries, including the U.K., Malta, and Rwanda, and as such, has certain exchange rate gains and losses associated with converting the foreign currency activity to the Company s reporting currency, USD.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Net revenue 5,385,077 3,677,896 1,707,181 46.4 Net revenue increased by 1.71 million, or 46.4 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Net revenue included 3.29 million from ICE, 766 thousand from Mastercard, 989 from a S P 500 Bank, and 345 thousand from other customers. The increase in net revenue was driven by revenue contracts executed by new and existing customers. Total net sales from new contracts produced 1.29 million, consisting of 1.04 million from ICE, 162 thousand from FIS, and the remaining 80 thousand from various other new statements of work. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company implemented its Orchestration Layer platforms. In the third quarter 2022, the Company acquired its first 2 customers on the platform through its partnership with FIS. In the fourth quarter, 4 additional customers onboarded, then 17 new customers since year-end, totaling to 23 total customers on the platform all related to FIS, including 23 financial institutions with over 50B in assets, as of February 2023. This platform is designed to be a one-stop shop for Trust Stamp services and provides for easy integration to our products; chargeable on a per-use basis and is accelerating the Company s evolution from being exclusively a custom solutions provider to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. The majority of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 came from the now-terminated ICE Contract for an alternative to detention program. The amount of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 3.29 million and 1.68 million, respectively.

 Cost of services provided 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Cost of services provided 1,785,167 1,151,057 634,110 55.1 Cost of services provided COS increased by 634 thousand, or 55.1 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase during the period was primarily driven by the 716 thousand increase in COS related to the ICE Contract, which included 509 thousand for mobile carrier costs and other direct costs required to service the contract. Additionally, the increase in COS was offset by the 139 thousand decrease in stock-based compensation compared to the prior year. As the Company continues its evolution from being exclusively a custom solutions provider to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation, management expects margins to improve as there are relatively lower variable cost required to implement existing technology and subsequent transaction revenue. Research and development 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Research and development 2,474,327 2,529,501 (55,174) (2.2) Research and development (R D) expense decreased by 55 thousand, or 2.2 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease consisted primarily of the 201 thousand decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation from 493 thousand to 292 thousand for the years ended 2021 and 2022, respectively, as a result of the decrease in the Company s stock price. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022 there was an increase to R D of 111 thousand, spent to implement a 24/7 customer service function. Selling, general, and administrative 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Selling, general, and administrative 12,444,009 8,314,575 4,129,434 49.7 Selling, general and administrative SG A expense increased by 4.13 million, or 49.7 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. SG A included 4.67 million in salaries and compensation, 2.09 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, 937 thousand in a combination of management consulting fees by the Disney Institute and various annual dues and subscriptions. Additionally, 1.81 million was spent in legal and professional services fees and other fees related to the listing of the Company s Class A Common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Salaries compensation costs increased by 938 thousand or 16.1 during the period. This increase included the 497 thousand paid as commissions as a result of cash received on the revenue contracts during the year ended 2022, compared to 96 thousand paid as commissions during the year ended 2021.The majority of sales commissions during both periods related to the ICE Contract, totaling 45 thousand and 397 thousand in the years ended 2021 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the increase in salaries and compensation consisted in part of the hires specifically for the labor-intensive ICE Contract, many of which were subsequently laid off following the contract termination. Other notable increases in SG A included an increase of 257 thousand on corporate and commercial travelling and 257 thousand on taxes. The remainder of the increase in SG A expenses from the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was driven other SG A operating expenses such as management consulting fees and various dues and subscriptions which amounted to an increase of 611 thousand.

Table of Contents 
 Depreciation and amortization D A expense increased by 187 thousand, or 32.6 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary increase in D A expense during the year was the 90 thousand for the depreciation of mobile hardware assets related to the ICE Contract. There were no mobile hardware assets or related depreciation expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Also driving the increase in D A expense is the total balance of capitalized internal-use software. As of December 31, 2022, the relatively smaller allocations of capitalized internal-use software, specifically from the year ended December 31, 2017, which had 277 thousand, have reached the completion of their 5 year useful lives. During the comparative periods, the capitalized from years ended 2016 and 2017, were progressively being replaced by larger allocations of capitalized internal-use software from the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, which had 636 thousand, 555 thousand, 360 thousand, 482 thousand, and 776 thousand, respectively, resulting in increased depreciation. We continue to see a trend of increasing software capitalization as a result of new software development. During the year ended December 31, 2022 this increase was driving primarily by the software developed and capitalized in relation to the ICE Contract, which has resulted in additional capitalized internal-use software amortization, or microservices, that once reaching technical feasibility, the Company begins to capitalize and subsequently amortize the related costs over a period of 5 years. The Company anticipates significant ongoing growth opportunities for its software products in the Alternative to Detention Program and in the provision of other in-community case management services for federal and state agencies. In addition, patent amortization increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as a result of new pending patent applications and issued patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company added thirteen (13) new pending patents and nine (9) issued patents. Operating loss 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Operating gain (loss) (12,078,923) (8,890,992) (3,187,931) 35.9 Operating loss increased by 3.19 million, or 35.9 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven primarily by SG A which made up 71.0 of the total operating expenses. As mentioned above, much of the increase in operating loss was due to increased R D activity, as well as an increase in SG A driving in part by the initial and ongoing costs related to the listing of the Company s Class A Common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Interest income (expense) 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Interest income (expense) (8,890) (39,970) 31,080 77.8 Interest income (expense) decreased by 31 thousand, or 77.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there was 8 thousand and 17 thousand of interest income and interest expense, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was 10 thousand and 50 thousand of interest income and interest expense, respectively. All interest earned and expensed during the comparative periods were a result of normal operating activities. The majority of the interest income (expense) in 2021 was generated by the interest on the SVB venture loan. This loan was in existence in 2021 and matured in April 2021, with a total interest of 35 thousand. The decrease in interest income (expense) in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the end of the SVB venture loan in 2021. Change in fair value of warrant liability

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change Other expense (118,196) (159,533) 41,337 25.9 Other expense decreased by 41 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to an 88 thousand decrease in unrealized loss on foreign currency translations for intercompany transactions between the parent company, T Stamp Inc., and its subsidiary, Trust Stamp Malta Limited with currencies denominated in United States Dollars and European Union Euros, respectively. Additionally, among other offsetting items, there was an increase of 32 thousand for realized exchange differences related to foreign currency exchange translation differences for when invoices are billed and cash collected. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there was 95 thousand unrealized loss on foreign currency translations that is recorded to other income for foreign currencies held by the Company s subsidiaries to meet expenses denominated in those currencies, the U.S. dollar cost of which expenses has fallen commensurately, therefore the unrealized loss will have no cash impact until the accounts are settled. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that there is currently no intention to settle intercompany accounts in the foreseeable future; therefore, future fluctuations in foreign currencies between the Company and its subsidiaries will be booked to accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. The change was effective as of June 30, 2022.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately 1.25 million and 3.48 million cash in our banking accounts, respectively. One of those bank accounts was with Silicon Valley Bank. On March 13, 2023, the Company had begun transferring its cash held with Silicon Valley Bank to JP Morgan Chase. The company does not anticipate any impairment or loss of cash as a result of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. The decrease of 2.22 million in cash from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was a result of the net negative cash flow which consisted of (6.34) million, 5.10 million, and (998) thousand, in operating, financing, and investing activities, respectively. Additionally, there was a 13 thousand cash inflow for currency transaction adjustment. See the cash flows section below for more details on cash activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. Total current assets for the comparative periods decreased by 50.1 or 2.89 million from 5.76 million as of December 31, 2021, to 2.87 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in current assets was primarily driven by the decrease in cash (discussed above). Additionally, there was a 417 thousand decrease in Prepaid expenses and other current assets related in part to the completion of the 3 year, 300 thousand Prepaid sponsorship related to Second Century Venture warrants. Accounts receivable decreased by 270 thousand compared to the prior year mostly due to the timing of receivables. Total current liabilities increased 2.05 million or 85.3 during the year. This increase is primarily attributable to the 1.31 million increase in deferred revenue driven mostly by the 1.76 million paid by Interactive Global Solutions IGS which will be used as credits for future services. Additionally, accounts payable increased by 661 thousand mostly due to the timing of payables. In effect, the Company s current ratio, that is, the ratio of the Company s total current assets as a multiple of total current liabilities or the Company s ability to service its current liabilities with its current cash assets, changed from 2.40 as of December 31, 2021, to 0.65 as of December 31, 2022. The change in current ratio is mostly a result of the non-cash 1.76 million increase in deferred revenue related to the of 12-year revenue contract that the Company executed during the year ended December 31, 2022. Effective September 3, 2019, the Company entered into a software license agreement with a customer pursuant to which the Company received total fees of 150 thousand in 2020, 200 thousand in 2021, and will receive minimum total fees of 250 thousand in 2022, rising by 15 in each subsequent year beginning in 2023 with a cap of 1.00 million. The Company has recognized 250 thousand of the software license agreement fees during the year ended December 31, 2022. On November 19, 2021, we closed the Regulation CF offering, having received binding commitments for 250,000 units at 20.00 per unit for a total of 5,000,000 in gross proceeds. We continued to hold closings on investments from investors who subscribed prior to November 19, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company received 4,353,480 in gross proceeds from the issuance of 217,674 Regulation CF Units to investors. The Company received an additional 198,420 in gross proceeds from the issuance of 9,921 Regulation CF Units to investors during the year ended December 31, 2022. On August 25, 2022, we refunded 5,000 in Regulation CF Units to two investors. We raised a final total of 4,546,900 in gross proceeds from the issuance of 227,345 Regulation CF units to investors in this offering as of December 31, 2022. The Company incurred offering costs of 48 thousand from this offering that were recorded as a reduction of the gross proceeds. On January 7, 2022, we closed on an initial tranche of investments from the Regulation D offering. We raised a final total of 863,956 in gross proceeds from the issuance of 43,198 Regulation D units to investors in this offering. We conducted an additional close on February 2, 2022, receiving gross proceeds of 100,000 and issuing 5,000 Regulation D units to that investor. On January 7, 2022, we closed the Regulation S offering. We raised a final total of 224,416 in gross proceeds from the issuance of 11,221 Regulation S units to investors in this offering. On January 26, 2022, we initially qualified an offering with the SEC under Regulation A to allow for the exercise of warrants issued pursuant to the Regulation CF, Regulation D, and Regulation S unit offerings. As of December 31, 2022, warrants for 2,850 shares have been exercised for 57 thousand by investors in these offerings. On September 11, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company agreed, at the closing of the SPA, to sell and issue to Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. in a private placement 195,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 390,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company for a total purchase price of 1,511,250.

 Pursuant to the SPA, the Company also agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd., pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to register for resale the 195,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (giving effect to the Reverse Split) to be purchased pursuant to the SPA, as well as the 390,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (giving effect to the Reverse Split) issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company filed such a registration statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by the SEC on January 26, 2023. No sales have been made to date under the registration statement by Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. We note that, as of March 29, 2023, the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market was 2.45 per share. Unless (and until) this price increases over 8.85, it is unlikely any of the Warrants would be exercised. On September 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement the MSA with Innovative Government Solutions IGS under which the Company and IGS will jointly offer services and IGS is granted a 12-year (renewable) license the license to resell the Company s technology subject to payment by IGS of agreed revenue advances and end user license fees. On execution of the MSA, IGS agrees to pay 1,500,000 to the Company as a non-refundable revenue advance, an additional 1,500,000 non-refundable revenue advance on the first anniversary of the MSA, and 1,000,000 on each of the next two anniversaries of the MSA as additional non-refundable revenue advances. IGS has the right to terminate the MSA for convenience before the additional non-refundable revenue advances become due in which case the unpaid additional non-refundable revenue advances will not be payable and the license will terminate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Trust Stamp received the initial 1.50 million payment, recorded the non-refundable revenue advance to deferred revenue, and recognized no IGS revenue. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is a business that has not yet generated profits, with a loss in the year ended December 31, 2022 of 12.09 million, operating cash outflows of 6.34 million for the same period, and an accumulated deficit of 39.30 million. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results. Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenue and raise capital as needed to satisfy its capital needs. While the negotiation of significant additional revenue is well advanced, it has not reached a stage that allows it to be factored into a going concern evaluation. In addition, although the Company has previously been successful in raising capital as needed and has already made plans to do so as well as restructuring expenses to meet the Company s cash needs, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its capital raising efforts. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash flows from operating activities (6,337,386) (6,702,221) Net cash flows from investing activities (998,190) (768,353) Net cash flows from financing activities 5,101,194 9,337,517 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 5.44 from 6.70 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 6.34 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Of the 12.09 million net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, there was a non-cash expense of 2.40 million related to stock-based compensation, 1.31 million for cash received and booked as deferred revenue driven primarily by the IGS revenue contract for service credits, 280 thousand in customer deposit liabilities from the delivery of performance obligations related to cash received from the ICE Contract in the prior year, a reversal of a gain due to the 113 thousand reduction of a warrant liability, a non-cash digital asset impairment of 28 thousand, the repayment of a loan to an employee of the Company through in-kind services of 112 thousand, a net non-cash decrease of 266 thousand as a result of the Company adopting the new lease standard,

 and 760 thousand for depreciation and amortization that was added back to net loss. Additionally, 1.52 million from the timing of accruals was subtracted from net loss to arrive at a 6.34 million cash outflow from operating activities. Net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 6.34 million and is primarily attributed to the ICE and IGS revenue contracts which totaled 3.66 million and 1.50 million, respectively. Cash from other revenue contracts, chiefly from the financial services and humanitarian industry verticals, totaled 2.39 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. These cash inflows from operating activities were offset by cash outflows from operating activities during the year which totaled 13.92 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 998 thousand, compared to net cash of 768 thousand used in the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 29.91 . Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were related primarily to continued investments to develop future technologies that we intend to capitalize and monetize over time. During the year ended December 31, 2022, capitalized internal-use software increased by 60.93 compared the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of increased capitalization of internally developed software related to the ICE Contract, which can be used in many other parallel commercial applications. This is also a result of the Company s investments in R D, which, during the year ended December 31, 2022, produced thirteen (13) new pending patent applications and nine (9) issued patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed an acquisition of Pixelpin Ltd (completed on March 18, 2021), in exchange for 91 thousand in cash. Pixelpin Ltd is an image-based Pin-on-Glass account access solution that alleviates pain-points of traditional login methods while ensuring the security of authentication. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired a digital asset in Decentraland to build its crypto key vault product. The digital asset was subsequently impaired. These acquisitions further enhance Trust Stamp s innovative portfolio of technology solutions that enable improved customer experiences and reputation while broadening the scope of internal risk-management strategies and providing additional options for multi-factor authentication. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was 5.10 million, compared to net cash of 9.34 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash received included the 3.33 million from a warrant exercise by SCV, a related party, received in December 2021 from SCV and REach Ventures, a related party, 95 thousand from the exercise of options, 1.42 million from the sale of Class A Common Stock and warrants exercisable into Class A Common Stock in a private investment in public equity agreement with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. Armistice PIPE ), 246 thousand in units sold in connection to the Company s 2021 raises under Regulation CF, Regulation D, and Regulation S in preparation for our Nasdaq listing net of raise costs, 57 thousand for Regulation CF, Regulation D, and Regulation S warrants exercised, and an offset of 90 thousand for principal payments made for the financial liability. Net cash provided by financing activities of 9.35 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily related to proceeds from issuance of common stock for 8.76 million, soft loan and grant proceeds from the government of Malta of 844 thousand, and the repayment of the promissory note payable with SCV of 379 thousand, including 35 thousand in interest. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. The critical accounting policies and estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.

Table of Contents 
 Capitalized Internal-Use Software, Net Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet our internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development are capitalized. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage through the development stage. These costs consist of personnel costs (including related benefits and stock-based compensation) that are incurred during the application development stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and during the post-implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project. Actual economic lives may differ from estimated useful lives. Periodic reviews could result in a change in estimated useful lives and therefore changes in amortization expense in future periods. Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenue primarily from professional services. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive or the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps: Identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer; Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; Determination of the transaction price; Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and Recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. 
 At contract inception, the Company will assess the services agreed upon within each contract and assess whether each service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. In general, each contract with a customer consists of a single performance obligation to perform services in which revenue is recognized when the service has been delivered. Contract Balances The timing of customer billing and payment relative to the start of the service period varies from contract to contract; however, the Company bills many of its customers in advance of the provision of services under its contracts, resulting in liabilities consisting of either deferred revenue (a contract liability or customer deposit liabilities. Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Such amounts are recognized by the Company over the life of the contract upon meeting the revenue recognition criteria, but generally within one year. Customer deposit liabilities consist of billings or payments received in advance of the start of the contractual term or for anticipated revenue generating activities for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation for convenience. Certain of the Company s arrangements generally include terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract for convenience and receive a refund of the amount of the customer deposit for the percentage of the work not performed prior to the notice of termination. In these arrangements, the Company concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations after such notice period and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer that is subject to termination for convenience is recorded as customer deposit liabilities. The payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however, the Company s terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient in accordance with ASC 606 to not adjust contract consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when promised goods and services are transferred 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods and services will be one year or less. As such, the Company determined its contracts do not generally contain a significant financing component. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of contracts, including sales commissions, and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Costs to obtain contracts were not material in the periods presented. The Company recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. Costs to fulfill contracts were not material in the periods presented. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient in accordance with ASC 340, which allows the Company to expense commissions as incurred when the contract term is twelve months or less in total. Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligations are comprised of product and services revenue not yet delivered. Warrants The Company accounts for stock warrants as either equity instruments, derivative liabilities, or liabilities in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ), depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere under Item 1 in this report. Emerging Growth Company As a Nasdaq listed public reporting company, we are required to publicly report on an ongoing basis as an emerging growth company (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act) under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company , we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other Exchange Act reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies , including but not limited to: not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; taking advantage of extensions of time to comply with certain new or revised financial accounting standards; being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and being exempt from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Table of Contents 
 We expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, beginning January 26, 2022, although if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of June 30th, before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31st. In summary, we are subject to ongoing public reporting requirements that are less rigorous than Exchange Act rules for companies that are not emerging growth companies and therefore, our shareholders could receive less information than they might expect to receive from more mature public companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results. Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenue and raise capital as needed to satisfy its capital needs. While the negotiation of significant additional revenue is well advanced, it has not reached a stage that allows it to be factored into a going concern evaluation. In addition, although the Company has previously been successful in raising capital as needed and has already made plans to do so as well as restructuring expenses to meet the Company s cash needs, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its capital raising efforts. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.

In March 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-03, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Accounting Alternative for Evaluating Triggering Events , an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments in this ASU allow companies to elect not to monitor for goodwill impairment triggering events during the reporting period and instead, to evaluate the facts and circumstances as of the end of the reporting period to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. This aligns the triggering event evaluation date with the reporting date, whether that date is an interim or annual reporting date. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance as of March 30, 2021. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2022, and the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations: Accounting for Contract Asset and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure The required disclosure related to our previous change in auditor can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 15, 2022. There have been no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding our control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer along with the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness, design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer along with the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective based on material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting As a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management identified certain material weaknesses relating to corporate finance and accounting, resulting in the Company not maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company has not maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as required for a public company. The resulting material weaknesses relate to insufficient management review and approval of each journal entry prior to its posting for preparation of the financial statements and disclosures. Additionally, it was concluded that we had inadequate controls over the management information systems related to program changes, segregation of duties, and access controls. As a result, it would be possible that the Company s business process controls that depend on the accuracy and completeness of data or financial reports generated by these information technology systems could be adversely affected due to the lack of operating effectiveness of information technology controls. The failure to establish effective internal controls could result in improperly accounting for transactions accurately, reliability in compiling financial information, and could significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud. Remediation Plan for Existing Material Weakness Management is committed to the remediation of the material weakness described above. As such, controls will be added to ensure precision of management s review and approval of each journal entry prior to its posting for preparation of the financial statements and disclosures and controls will be added to ensure adequate controls over management information systems related to program changes, segregation of duties, and access controls. It is our belief that these added controls will effectively remediate the existing material weakness.

 Previously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As disclosed in Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to certain corporate finance and accounting oversight functions residing over the detection of errors that were present within the Company s calculation of stock-based awards as well as the financial reporting close process. Remediation Efforts to Address Previous Material Weakness We recognize the importance of the control environment as it sets the overall tone for the Company and is the foundation for all other components of internal control. Consequently, we designed and implemented remediation measures to address the material weakness related to the calculation of stock-based awards and the financial reporting close process, as further described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 6, 2022 and December 22, 2022, respectively. Considering the material weakness, we performed the following remediation actions during the year ended December 31, 2022: Remediations regarding calculations of stock-based awards: Established multiple layers of reviews of equity awards calculations to ensure that the calculations match the terms in the award agreement and formulas are correct. Monthly checks to ensure that any new award agreement has been accounted for appropriately in the calculations and equity reports, and that active agreements have been checked for expiration or changes in agreements terms. Perform reconciliations between information in our equity workbook and the colonial report to ensure that issued shares and warrants are captured in our books. A list of all shareholders is reviewed and updated monthly to ensure that any new shareholder has been recorded and total number of outstanding shares in our workbook matches the one in from the colonial report. Any discrepancies are resolved before any entry can be posted in our financials. Ensure that the equity closing process checklist has been followed and completed on a monthly basis. Our equity section has various monthly closing tasks and we use Favro to keep track of these tasks including when they have been completed and reviewed. Favro assist in showing which tasks have been completed, reviewed, and which one are still pending for completion and/or review. The stock-based compensation entry is reviewed by the Finance Director before being posted in our financials. Our equity workbook is consistently reviewed and improved for effectiveness by our Finance Director who has expertise in Equity related transactions and 2 accounting staff are also continuously trained to better understand this section and master all needed processes to update the equity workbook. 
 We consider our remediation efforts with respect to the material weakness identified during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 specifically related to stock based compensation to be complete as of December 31, 2022 because we believe the enhanced controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except for our remediation of the material weakness described above and additional material weaknesses noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In making these determinations, our Board of Directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business, personal activities, and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. As required under Nasdaq rules and regulations and in expectation of listing on Nasdaq, our independent directors meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors are present. Board Leadership Structure and Board s Role in Risk Oversight William McClintock is the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman has authority, among other things, to preside over Board meetings and set the agenda for Board meetings. Accordingly, the Chairman has substantial ability to shape the work of our Board of Directors. We currently believe that separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ensures appropriate oversight by the Board of our business and affairs. However, no single leadership model is right for all companies and at all times. The Board of Directors recognizes that depending on the circumstances, other leadership models, such as the appointment of a lead independent director, might be appropriate. Accordingly, the Board may periodically review its leadership structure. In addition, the Board will hold executive sessions in which only independent directors are present. Our Board is generally responsible for the oversight of corporate risk in its review and deliberations relating to our activities. Risk is inherent in every business. As is the case in virtually all businesses, we face a number of risks, including operational, economic, financial, legal, regulatory, and competitive risks. Our management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face. Our Board of Directors, as a whole, through its committees has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its oversight role, our Board of Directors involvement in our business strategy and strategic plans plays a key role in its oversight of risk management, its assessment of management s risk appetite, and its determination of the appropriate level of enterprise risk. Our Board of Directors receives updates at least quarterly from senior management and periodically from outside advisors regarding the various risks we face, including operational, economic, financial, legal, regulatory, and competitive risks. Our Board of Directors also reviews the various risks we identify in our filings with the SEC and risks relating to various specific developments, such as acquisitions, debt and equity placements, and new service offerings. Our Board committees assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight role in certain areas of risk. Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks, including those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this annual report on Form 10-K. Our Board is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect us. This oversight is conducted primarily by our full Board, which has responsibility for general oversight of risks. Committees of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee (the Audit Committee ), a Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ). The composition and function of each committee are described below. Audit Committee The Audit Committee has three members, including Mr. Birschbach, Mr. McClintock, and Ms. Stafford. Mr. Birschbach serves as the chairman of the Audit Committee and satisfies the definition of audit committee financial expert .

 Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee has three members, including Mr. McClintock, Mr. Birschbach, and Ms. Pappenheim. Mr. McClintock serves as the chairman of the Compensation Committee. Our Compensation Committee is authorized to: review and determine the compensation arrangements for management; establish and review general compensation policies with the objective to attract and retain superior talent, to reward individual performance and to achieve our financial goals; administer our stock incentive and purchase plans; and review the independence of any compensation advisers. 
 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has three members, including Ms. Stafford, Mr. McClintock, and Mr. Birschbach. Mr. McClintock serves as the chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The functions of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, among other things, include: identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending directors to be elected; nominees and Board members for committee membership; developing and recommending to our Board corporate governance guidelines; review and determine the compensation arrangements for directors; and overseeing the evaluation of our Board of Directors and its committees and management. 
 Our goal is to assemble a Board that brings together a variety of skills derived from high quality business and professional experience. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation None of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of our Company, nor will they be. None of our executive officers has served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the Compensation Committee or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who served on our board of directors or compensation committee during

 2021 or 2022. For a description of transactions between us and members of our Compensation Committee and affiliates of such members (if any), please see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions . Code of Business Conduct and Ethics We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all our employees, officers and directors, including those officers responsible for financial reporting. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, contains provisions limiting the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. Our Amended Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and Bylaws also provide our Board of Directors with discretion to indemnify our employees and other agents when determined appropriate by the Board. In addition, each employment agreement entered into between the Company and its officers and/or directors contains certain indemnification provisions, which requires us to indemnify them in certain circumstances. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling our Company pursuant to the foregoing provision, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. Section 16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors and executive officers, persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of the Company s equity securities, and certain other persons to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC, and to furnish the Company with copies of the forms. Based solely on its review of the forms it received, or written representations from reporting persons, except as set forth herein, the Company believes that all of its directors, executive officers, and greater than 10 beneficial owners complied with all such filing requirements during 2021 and 2022.

 Reverse Split On February 15, 2023 our Board of Directors approved and, as of February 20, 2023 the holders of a majority of our voting capital stock approved an amendment (the Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock at a ratio of one share for every five currently held, rounded up to the nearest whole share (the Reverse Split ). The Amendment was filed and became effective on March 23, 2023.The par value of the Class A Common Stock will not be changed nor will the number of authorized shares be reduced in connection with the Reverse Split. The Board of Directors determined that the availability of additional shares was necessary to consummate future financing transactions. The availability of additional shares will also permit the Board of Directors to issue shares, or instruments convertible into or exercisable for such shares, for general corporate purposes. When implemented, the Reverse Split will be in the same ratio for all shares of Class A Common Stock. All holders of Class A Common Stock will be affected uniformly by the Reverse Split, which will have no effect on the proportionate holdings of any of our stockholders, except for possible changes due to the treatment of fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company will round up in the event a stockholder would be entitled to receive less than one share of Class A Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Split. In addition, the split will not affect any holder of Class A Common Stock s proportionate voting power (subject to the treatment of fractional shares), and all shares of Class A Common Stock will remain fully paid and non-assessable. When implemented by the Board, the Reverse Split will be effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Board of Directors will determine the actual time of filing of the Amendment. The following chart reflects the changes in our capital structure following the Reverse Split, the top row reflecting the pre-split capital structure and the bottom row reflecting the post-split capital structure both as of February 20, 2023:

Concurrently with the issuance of the note on April 22, 2020, the Company entered into a warrant agreement to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company with SCV. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the Company issued SCV a warrant to purchase 15,000 shares at a strike price of 0.01 per share through April 22, 2021. At the expiration of the warrant agreement the warrants will be automatically exercised if the fair market value of the exercise shares exceeds the exercise price. If at any time during the term the fair market value of the exercise shares exceeds five times the exercise price, the Company shall provide SCV written notice and SCV may elect to exercise the warrant. If at any time during the term of the warrant agreement any portion of the shares of Class A Common Stock are converted to other securities, the warrants shall become immediately exercisable for that number of shares of the other securities that would have been received if the warrant agreement had been exercised in full prior to the conversion and the exercise price shall be adjusted. These warrants were exercised on April 22, 2021 at 0.01 per share.
