 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General During the year ended December 31, 2022 and prior to closing the Business Combination, JATT was a blank check company incorporated on March 10, 2021 as a Cayman Islands corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a Business Combination ). For more information on the Business Combination, see the section entitled Explanatory Note elsewhere in this Report. Prior to closing the Business Combination, we neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Based on our business activities prior to closing the Business Combination, we were a shell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act because we had no operations and nominal assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents. On March 22, 2021, JATT Ventures, LP (the sponsor ), purchased 4,312,500 founder shares, which were JATT Class B ordinary shares, for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.006 per share. On June 14, 2021, the sponsor surrendered 862,500 founder shares to us for no consideration, resulting in a decrease in the total number of founder shares outstanding from 4,312,500 to 3,450,000. Prior to the investment in the Company of 25,000 by the sponsor the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. On July 16, 2021 the Company consummated the initial public offer, or IPO, of 12,000,000 units (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value 0.0001 per share JATT Class A Ordinary Shares and one-half of one redeemable warrant each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for 11.50 per share Public Warrants ). The Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 120,000,000. As of July 16, 2021, a total of 121,200,000 10.10 per Unit) of the net proceeds from the IPO and a portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders (the Trust Account ). On July 19, 2021, in connection with the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,800,000 Units, and the sale of an additional 540,000 Private Placement Warrants each at 1.00 per warrant, generating total gross proceeds of 18,540,000. Following the closing, an additional 18,180,000 of the net proceeds 10.10 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account, resulting in 139,380,000 10.10 per Unit) held in the Trust Account. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated a private placement (the Private Placement in which the sponsor purchased 5,370,000 private warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of 5,370,000. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for 11.50 per share, and is subject to transfer restrictions. Upon the closing of the underwriters over-allotment option in full on July 19, 2021, an additional 540,000 Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the sponsor at a price of 1.00 per warrant for a total of 540,000. As a result, a total of 5,910,000 Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the Sponsor for aggregate consideration of 5,910,000 in connection with the closing of the IPO and the closing of the over-allotment option. The Private Placement Warrants may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders thereof until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The holders of the Private Placement Warrants were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Placement. The Private Placement Warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. Following the closing of the IPO on July 13, 2021 and the underwriters exercise of over-allotment option on July 19, 2021, 139,380,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 141,474,352 held in the Trust Account, which primarily consisted of investments in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities, cash, or a combination thereof.

On March 8, 2023, Zura and Hydra signed a limited waiver letter under the Hydra Promissory Note (the Waiver Letter ), pursuant to which Hydra agreed to waive its acceleration right in consideration of Zura paying to Hydra 125 of the Principal Amount (equal to 10,000,000 in the aggregate) on the earlier of December 8, 2023 and five business days after the consummation of the Business Combination.

Forward Purchase Agreements On August 5, 2021, we entered into Forward Purchase Agreements with certain of our Anchor Investors, Athanor Master Fund LP AMF and with Athanor International Master Fund, LP AIF (collectively the Forward Purchase Agreements , and collectively, AMF and AIF are FPA Purchasers ). Pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreements, we were to issue and sell to the FPA Purchasers, and the FPA Purchasers were to purchase from us, an aggregate of 7,500,000 forward purchase shares, or Forward Purchase Shares , for a purchase price of 10.00 per Forward Purchase Share, or 75,000,000 in the aggregate. Each Forward Purchase Share will consist of one Class A ordinary share of the Company. The Class A ordinary shares would have the same terms as the Company s publicly traded Class A ordinary shares but will be restricted securities and not be freely tradable until registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC ). In January 2022, we amended the Forward Purchase Agreements Amended Forward Purchase Agreements to: (1) reduce the number of forward purchase shares from an aggregate of 7,500,000 to 3,000,000 and from a total 75,000,000 in the aggregate to 30,000,000 in the aggregate; and (2) to add a requirement for the FPA Purchasers to provide a binding redemption backstop (the Redemption Backstop to purchase an additional 15 million of redeeming shareholders in the event that redemptions are greater than 90 in connection with a Business Combination (the Excess Redemptions and (3) to add a requirement that at the time of entering into a binding agreement for the Business Combination, the Purchasers will directly provide the target merger company (Target with bridge financing of 30 million evidenced by a convertible promissory note Convertible Note which shall be convertible into the our Class A ordinary shares at the closing of the Business Combination.

The agreement previously provided that such shares would be purchased from public stockholders. The FPA Purchasers will be issued an additional 2,500,000 Class A Shares upon the closing of the business combination previously announced between JATT and Zura in connection with the amendment. For more information, the full text of the Amended Forward Purchase Agreements are included as Exhibit 10.1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on April 11, 2022, and our Current Report on 8-K dated March 10, 2023. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates before the Business Combination This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: 

Table of Contents 
 Derivative Financial Instruments We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued share purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. The warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation and a Black Scholes option pricing model, respectively. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants continues to be measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the Public Warrants were subsequently measured at their listed trading price since they began to be separately listed and traded beginning in September 2021. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation will not be reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities. Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period. The calculation of diluted net income per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option) and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 12,810,000 ordinary shares because their exercise is contingent upon future events. The number of weighted average Class B ordinary shares for calculating basic net income per ordinary share was reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 450,000 Class B ordinary shares that were subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option was not exercised in full or part by the underwriters. Since the contingency was satisfied, the Company included these shares in the weighted average number as of the beginning of the period to determine the dilutive impact of these shares. Fair value adjustment associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares is classified as shareholders equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 13,800,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares are subject to possible redemption and are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Effective with the closing of the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option), we recognized the fair value adjustment from initial book value to redemption amount, which resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on March 10, 2021 (inception). Adoption of the ASU did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA This information appears following Item 15 of this Report and is included herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.

 ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2022, as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, the Company s management has concluded that our control around the interpretation and accounting for certain complex financial instruments issued by us was not effectively designed or maintained. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 

Table of Contents 
 (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022, for the reasons described above in Disclosure Controls and Procedures . This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting except for the below. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed additional accounting and financial analyses and other post-closing procedures including consulting with subject matter experts related to the accounting for certain complex financial instruments. The Company s management has expended, and will continue to expend, a substantial amount of effort and resources for the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we have expanded and will continue to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. ITEM 9B OTHER INFORMATION None.

Dr. Graham currently serves on the boards of ASLAN Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaxis Ltd. Dr. Graham holds an MD, MPH, MBBS from the University of Adelaide. We believe he is well-qualified to serve as a director due to his extensive scientific and operational experience. Board Composition The Company s business and affairs will be organized under the direction of its board of directors. The board of directors of the Company will meet on a regular basis and additionally as required. In accordance with the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which will be effective upon the consummation of the Business Combination, The Company s board of directors may establish the authorized number of directors from time to time by resolution. The Company s board of directors will consist of seven members upon the consummation of the Business Combination. Director Independence In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company board of directors will undertake a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, it is expected that the board of directors of the Company will determine that none of the directors, other than Dr. Someit Sidhu, has any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of Amit Munshi, Sandeep Kulkarni, Garry Neil, Steve Schoch, Jennifer Jarrett and Neil Graham is independent as that term is defined under the Nasdaq listing standards. In making these determinations, the JATT board of directors will consider the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with the management and principal shareholders of Zura and all other facts and circumstances the Company s board of directors deems relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of securities of Zura by each non-employee director and the transactions described in the section titled Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions . Board Leadership Structure The Company s board of directors is expected to be chaired by Amit Munshi, an independent director. In such role, Amit Munshi will have authority, among other things, to call and preside over board of directors meetings, to set meeting agendas, and to determine materials to be distributed to the board of directors. The Company s board of directors believes that separating the positions of Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chairman of the Board is in the best interests of the Company. We believe that keeping the two positions separate helps to ensure proper board oversight over management s decision-making and performance, protects the board s independence, and enables both the CEO and the Chairman of the Board to exercise their respective roles without the appearance of any conflict of interests or responsibilities. Amit Munshi, Sandeep Kulkarni, Garry Neil, Steve Schoch, Jennifer Jarrett and Neil Graham will serve as independent directors who provide active and effective oversight of the Company s strategic decisions. As of the date of this filing, the Company s board of directors has determined that the leadership structure of the Company s board of directors will permit the board of directors to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently and is appropriate given the size and scope of the Company and its financial condition. Board Oversight of Risk Upon the consummation of Business Combination, one of the key functions of Company s board of directors will be to conduct informed oversight of Company s risk management process. Company s board of directors does not anticipate having a standing risk management committee, but rather anticipates administering this oversight function directly through Company s board of directors as a whole, as well as through various standing committees of the board of directors that address risks inherent in their respective areas of 

Table of Contents 
 oversight. In particular, the board of directors will be responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure and Company s audit committee will have the responsibility to consider and discuss Company s major financial risk exposures and the steps its management will take to monitor and control such exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The audit committee will also monitor compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Company s compensation committee will also assess and monitor whether Company s compensation plans, policies and programs comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Board Committees After the consummation of the Business Combination, the board will establish an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and governance committee. The Company s board may establish other committees to facilitate the management of the post-Business Combination company s business. The Company s board and its committees will set schedules for meeting throughout the year and can also hold extraordinary general meetings and act by written resolution from time to time, as appropriate. The Company s board will delegate various responsibilities and authority to its committees as generally described below. The committees will regularly report on their activities and actions to the full Company board. Each member of the audit committee of the Company board is expected to qualify as an independent director in accordance with Nasdaq listing standards. The compensation and nominating and governance committees will each have at least one independent director. Each committee of the Company board will have a written charter approved by the Company board. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, copies of each charter will be posted on Company s website once established. The inclusion of the post-Business Combination company s website address in this proxy statement/prospectus does not include or incorporate by reference the information on the Company s website into this proxy statement/prospectus. Members will serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by the board. Audit Committee After the consummation of the Business Combination, the members of Company s audit committee will be Amit Munshi, Jennifer Jarrett and Steve Schoch, each of whom can read and understand fundamental financial statements. Each of Amit Munshi, Jennifer Jarrett and Steve Schoch is independent under the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq listing standards applicable to audit committee members. Steve Schoch will be the chair of the audit committee. The JATT board has determined that Steve Schoch qualifies as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of SEC regulations and meets the financial sophistication requirements of the Nasdaq. In arriving at these determinations, the JATT board has examined each audit committee member s scope of experience and the nature of their employment. The primary purpose of the audit committee will be to discharge the responsibilities of Company s board of directors with respect to the corporate accounting and financial reporting processes, systems of internal control and financial statement audits, and to oversee the independent registered public accounting firm. Specific responsibilities of the audit committee will include: helping the board of directors oversee corporate accounting and financial reporting processes; 
 managing the selection, engagement, qualifications, independence and performance of a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements; discussing the scope and results of the audit with the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewing, with management and the independent accountants, the interim and year-end operating results; developing procedures for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters; reviewing related person transactions; obtaining and reviewing a report by the independent registered public accounting firm at least annually that describes internal quality control procedures, any material issues with such procedures and any steps taken to deal with such issues when required by applicable law; and approving or, as permitted, pre-approving, audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.

 Compensation Committee The compensation committee will consist of Sandeep Kulkarni and Amit Munshi. The chair of the compensation committee will be Sandeep Kulkarni. The board has determined that each member of the compensation committee is independent under the Nasdaq listing standards and a non-employee director as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The primary purpose of the compensation committee will be to discharge the responsibilities of the board of directors in overseeing the compensation policies, plans and programs and to review and determine the compensation to be paid to executive officers, directors and other senior management, as appropriate. Specific responsibilities of the compensation committee will include: reviewing and approving the compensation of the chief executive officer, other executive officers and senior management;

 statement/prospectus, and you should not consider information contained on Company s website to be part of this proxy statement/prospectus. Related Party Policy Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company board of directors will adopt a written related person transactions policy that sets forth the Company s policies and procedures regarding the identification, review, consideration and oversight of related person transactions. For purposes of the Company s policy only, a related person transaction is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which Company or any of its subsidiaries are participants involving an amount that exceeds 120,000, in which any related person has a material interest. A related person is any executive officer, director, nominee to become a director or a holder of more than 5 of any class of the Company s voting securities (including Company s ordinary shares), including any of their immediate family members and affiliates, including entities owned or controlled by such persons. Under the policy, the related person in question or, in the case of transactions with a holder of more than 5 of any class of Company s voting securities, an officer with knowledge of a proposed transaction, must present information regarding the proposed related person transaction to Company s audit committee (or, where review by Company s audit committee would be inappropriate, to another independent body of Company s board of directors) for review. To identify related person transactions in advance, Company will rely on information supplied by Company s executive officers, directors and certain significant shareholders. In considering related person transactions, Company s audit committee will take into account the relevant available facts and circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to: the risks, costs, and benefits to Company; the impact on a director s independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated; the terms of the transaction; the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties. 
 The Company s audit committee will approve only those transactions that it determines are fair to the Company and in the Company s best interests. All of the transactions described above were entered into prior to the adoption of such policy. Certain of the foregoing disclosures are summaries of certain provisions of our related party agreements, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all of the provisions of such agreements. Because these descriptions are only summaries of the applicable agreements, they do not necessarily contain all of the information that you may find useful. Copies of certain of the agreements (or forms of the agreements) have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and are available electronically on the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation None of our officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the Board or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our Ordinary shares to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such Forms, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2021 there were no delinquent filers.

 Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees.. You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. See the section of this annual report entitled Where You Can Find Additional Information. Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Cayman Islands law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our shareholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful share purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. We have entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Cayman Islands law would permit such indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. Except with respect to any public shares they may acquire in this offering or thereafter (in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination), our officers and directors have agreed to waive (and any other persons who may become an officer or director prior to the initial business combination will also be required to waive) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and not to seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever, including with respect to such indemnification. These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. We believe that these provisions, the directors and officers liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Certain Transactions of JATT Prior to Closing the Business Combination Founder Shares On March 22, 2021, our sponsor purchased 4,312,500 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.006 per share. On June 14, 2021, our sponsor effected a surrender of 862,500 Founder Shares to us for no consideration, resulting in a decrease in the total number of Founder Shares outstanding from 4,312,500 to 3,450,000. Prior to the investment in the company of 25,000 by our sponsor the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share purchase price 

Table of Contents 
 of the Founder Shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the aggregate number of Founder Shares issued. The number of Founder Shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20 of the outstanding shares upon completion of the Business Combination. The Initial Shareholders have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to permitted transferees, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until six months after the consummation of a business combination or earlier if, subsequent to a business combination, JATT consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the public shareholders having the right to exchange their JATT Class A Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property. Private Placement Warrants Our sponsor has, pursuant to a written agreement, purchased an aggregate of 5,910,000 private placement warrants for a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the closing of our IPO offering. As such, our sponsor s interest in this transaction is valued at 5,910,000. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A ordinary shares at a price of 11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. Administrative Services Agreement Commencing on the closing of our IPO, we have paid our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. In addition, we may pay our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation in connection with identifying, investigating and completing our initial business combination. These individuals will also be reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which fees and expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on payments that may be made to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates. Registration Rights Holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants (and their underlying securities) and any Warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and their underlying securities), if any, have registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands; excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed by us subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Related Party Notes Prior to the closing of the IPO offering, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to an aggregate of 200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the closing of the Business Combination. The loan was repaid upon the closing of the IPO offering out of the estimated 1,250,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account. The value of our sponsor s interest in this transaction corresponds to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan. Working Capital Loans In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price,

 exercisability and exercise period. The Sponsor has agreed to loan JATT an aggregate of up to 300,000 in working capital loan to cover expenses related to the Business Combination pursuant to a promissory note, dated May 11, 2022 (the Note ). This loan is non- interest bearing. At September 30, 2022, 300,000 was outstanding under the Note. Such Working Capital Loans may be repaid out of the proceeds of the trust account that holds a portion of the proceeds of the IPO and the concurrent sale of the Private Placement Warrants (the Trust Account released to JATT or converted into Lender Warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant, such warrants to be identical to the private placement warrants. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. Insider Letter Agreement and Amendment Upon the closing of the JATT IPO, the Sponsor, members of JATT s board of directors and certain other individuals (collectively, the Insiders who hold the Founder Shares entered into a letter agreement with JATT, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 17, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 17, 2023, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame and (iv) vote any Founder Shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the Business Combination (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Insiders who hold JATT Founder Shares entered into an Amendment to the Insider Letter Agreement (the Amended Insider Letter Agreement ), which provides, among other things, that certain Founder Shares shall be subject to certain time and share-performance-based vesting provisions described below. The Sponsor and the Insiders agreed that they shall not transfer any Founder Shares until the earlier of (A) six months after the completion of the initial business combination and (B) the date following the completion of an initial business combination on which JATT completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the public shareholders having the right to exchange their JATT Class A Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, subsequent to the Business Combination, the closing price of the JATT Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30- trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Business Combination, the Founder Shares shall be released from the lock-up restrictions. The Amended Insider Letter Agreement also provides that neither the Sponsor nor the Insiders will redeem any JATT Class A Ordinary Shares owned by such persons in connection with the Business Combination. Related Party Policy JATT s Code of Ethics requires it to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the JATT board (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed 120,000 in any calendar year, (2) it or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5 beneficial owner of JATT Class A Ordinary Shares, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10 beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.

 The audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent JATT enters into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to JATT than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party s interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party, but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. JATT also requires each of its directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. To further minimize conflicts of interest, JATT has agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of the Sponsor, officers or directors unless it has obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, and the approval of a majority of our disinterested independent directors that the Business Combination is fair to JATT s unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. PIPE Financing Subscription Agreement In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, JATT entered into the Subscription Agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which such investor agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 2,000,000 New JATT Class A Ordinary Shares at 10.00 per share for an aggregate commitment amount of 20 million. The closing under the Subscription Agreement will occur substantially concurrently with the Closing. The Subscription Agreement provides that, solely with respect to subscriptions by the PIPE Investor, New JATT is required to file with the SEC, within 30 days after the Closing (the Filing Deadline ), a registration statement registering the resale of the New JATT Class A Ordinary Shares to be issued to any such third-party investor and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day (or 120th calendar day if the SEC reviews the and has written comments to such registration statement) following the earlier of (A) the filing of the registration statement and (B) Filing Deadline and (ii) the 10th business day after the date New JATT is notified (in writing) by the SEC that such registration statement will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further review. However, New JATT may delay such filing or effectiveness of such registration statement under certain circumstances, including if the Company were required to update the financial statements included in such registration statement in order to comply with Regulation S-X age of financial statement requirements. Additionally, pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the PIPE Investor agreed to waive any claims that it may have at the Closing or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, the Subscription Agreement against JATT, including with respect to the Trust Account. The Subscription Agreement will terminate, and be of no further force and effect, upon the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (ii) upon the mutual written agreement of New JATT, JATT and the applicable PIPE Investor. Additionally, contingent upon the percentage of public shareholders who elect to redeem their shares at Closing, the PIPE Investor shall receive up to 1,654,800 Forfeited Private Placement Warrants transferred from the Sponsor. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, JATT may enter into subscription agreements with additional investors, providing for aggregate investments (including the PIPE Financing) in New JATT Class A Ordinary Shares in a private placement of an amount not less than 20,000,000 at 10 per New JATT Class A Ordinary Share. Assuming the New JATT Class A Ordinary Shares would have a market value equivalent to that of the JATT public shares, the shares to be purchased in the PIPE Financing by the PIPE Investor would have an aggregate market value of approximately 20.9 million, based on the closing price of JATT public shares of 10.45 on the NYSE on February 16, 2023, the Record Date for the General Meeting. Additionally, contingent upon the percentage of public shareholders who elect to redeem their shares at Closing, the PIPE Investor shall receive up to 1,654,800 Forfeited Private Placement Warrants transferred from the Sponsor.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of ZURA BIO LTD (f/k/a JATT Acquisition Corp) Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ZURA BIO LTD (f/k/a JATT Acquisition Corp) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, shareholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from March 10, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from March 10, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021. March 28, 2023

 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares have been recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which were adopted by the Company upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Founder Shares prior to this Initial Public Offering (the Initial Shareholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the Company agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial Business Combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. The Company s Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide for the redemption of its Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by April 17, 2023 (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholder s rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.

 of the Company s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Company s taxes payable (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses). The Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company s Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Trust Account Redemptions and Extension of Combination Period On January 12, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general shareholders meeting to vote upon a charter amendment to extend the time to complete a Business Combination until April 17, 2023 (the Extension Amendment ). The shareholders approved the Extension Amendment. As a result of the approval of the Extension Amendment, the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees) has made a deposit into the Trust Account in the amount of , which was the lesser of (a) or (b) for each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with the extraordinary general meeting, in exchange for an unsecured promissory note issued by the Company to the Sponsor.

 of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding after such conversion, including the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination, any private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. warrants outstanding, comprised of and Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, respectively. The Company accounts for the warrants as derivative warrant liabilities in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability due to the existence of provisions whereby adjustments to the exercise price of the warrants is based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option and the existence of the potential for net cash settlement for the warrant holders (but not all shareholders) in the event of a tender offer. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder (or the Company permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under certain circumstances). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. The warrants have an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the initial shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the initial shareholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Class A ordinary shares during the

 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger prices described under Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds and Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described under Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Proposed Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or such purchasers permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Initial Shareholders or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds : Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants): in whole and not in part; at a price of per warrant; upon a minimum of prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and if, and only if, the last reported sale price (the closing price of Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 The Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the redemption period. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants transferred from a Level 3 fair value measurement to a Level 1 fair value measurement, when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded in September 2021. Level 1 instruments include investments in U.S Treasury securities or money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, quoted market prices from dealers or brokers, and other similar sources to determine the fair value of its investments. The fair value of the Public Warrants as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was measured utilizing the Level 1 input of the observable listed trading price for such warrants. The fair value of the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation and a Black Scholes option pricing model, respectively. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants continues to be measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Inherent in a Monte Carlo simulation and a Black Scholes option pricing model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its warrants based on implied volatility from the Company s traded warrants and from historical volatility of select peer company s ordinary shares that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. The following table provides quantitative information regarding Level 3 fair value measurements inputs used to estimate fair value of the warrants at their measurement dates: Stock price Volatility Term (years) Risk-free rate Dividend yield
