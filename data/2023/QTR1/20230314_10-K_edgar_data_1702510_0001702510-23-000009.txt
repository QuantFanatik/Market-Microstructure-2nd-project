 Item 1. Business 
 Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act ). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Code ). We were formed on February 10, 2017, conducted our initial private offering (the Initial Private Offering of our shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and completed our initial closing of capital commitment on September 11, 2017 (the "Commencement, or the Initial Closing Date ). We held additional closings subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, with our final closing pursuant to the Initial Private Offering occurring on November 9, 2018. We commenced our loan origination and investment activities shortly after our initial capital drawdown from our investors in the Initial Private Offering (the Initial Drawdown and the date on which the Initial Drawdown occurred, the Initial Drawdown Date ), which was called on September 22, 2017 and settled by October 4, 2017. In the first quarter of 2022, we commenced our New Continuous Offering, as discussed further in Corporate Structure below. Our principal executive offices are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017. 
 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and current income primarily through assembling a portfolio of senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately 25 million to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), supported by financial sponsors. This core strategy is opportunistically supplemented with differentiated and complementary lending and investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans ), with a minority of our assets invested in higher yielding investments (which may include unsecured debt, subordinated debt and investments in equities). 
 We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt has been rated below investment grade, or would likely be rated below investment grade if such debt was rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have

 predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investments Our investments are risky and speculative. 
 Our investment approach is focused on capital preservation based on long-term fundamental credit performance. Our Investment Adviser s investment team utilizes a rigorous, systematic, and consistent investment process, refined over Carlyle s 35-year history investing in private markets across multiple cycles, designed to achieve enhanced risk-adjusted returns. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
 Corporate Structure 
 On January 21, 2022, stockholders approved (i) our conversion from a finite life private BDC with no interim liquidity to a private BDC with a perpetual life and a regular quarterly liquidity program by extending indefinitely our finite term and finite investment period and permitting us to accept new subscriptions for shares of our common stock in a new continuous private offering (the New Continuous Offering and (ii) an amendment and restatement (the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement of our existing investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Investment Adviser (the January 2022 Proposals ). More specifically, in the case of the conversion to a perpetual life BDC, our stockholders approved: 
 extending indefinitely our term, which was scheduled to end at the close of business on November 9, 2025; 
 extending indefinitely our investment period (the Investment Period ), which was scheduled to end at the close of business on September 11, 2022 (the Original Investment Period and 
 permitting us to accept new subscriptions in the New Continuous Offering. 
 Our Board of Directors may terminate the Investment Period at any time in its discretion. The Company may be dissolved at any time upon a decision of our Board of Directors, subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act. 
 On January 22, 2022, we and our Investment Adviser executed the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement. For additional information, see Our Investment Adviser. 
 As of result of the stockholder approval of the January 2022 Proposals, we intend, subject to market and other conditions, to conduct recurring quarterly tender offers Quarterly Tender Offers for our common stock in order to offer regular liquidity to stockholders, the first of which commenced June 30, 2022. Initially, we expect to offer to repurchase through the Quarterly Tender Offers at least 3.5 of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately prior to the quarter in which the Quarterly Tender Offer is conducted, at a specific per share price based on our net asset value per share as of the last date of the quarter in which the Quarterly Tender Offer is conducted. 
 
 If during any consecutive 24-month period, we do not engage in a Quarterly Tender Offer in which we accept for purchase 100 of properly tendered shares (a Qualifying Tender ), we will not make commitments for new portfolio investments (excluding short-term cash management investments under 30 days in duration) and will reserve available assets to satisfy future tender requests until a Qualifying Tender occurs, subject to our continuing to use available funds and liquidity for certain purposes . Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will continue to use available funds and liquidity (a) to pay, and/or establish reserves for, our actual or anticipated expenses, including management and incentive fees, any amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations and any other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, whether incurred before, during or after the end of the relevant 24-month period, (b) to fulfill investment commitments made or approved by our Investment Adviser s investment committee prior to the expiration of the relevant 24-month period, (c) to fund follow-on investments made in existing portfolio companies (including transactions to hedge interest rate relating to such additional investments) and amounts to protect the value of existing investments (for example, without limitation, follow-on debt or equity investments made to protect existing investments) as necessary, (d) to engage in hedging transactions, (e) to fund obligations under any guarantee or indemnity made by us prior to the end of the relevant 24-month period, (f) to fulfill obligations with respect to any purchase price due from an investor on a drawdown date that such investor fails to pay or (g) as necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including the Investment Company Act and the Code. 
 
 In addition to engaging in Quarterly Tender Offers, our stockholders were provided with additional liquidity through a special, one-time tender offer launched by CDL Tender Fund 2022-1, L.P. (the Purchaser which commenced on April 5, 2022. The Purchaser accepted for purchase 100 million in aggregate amount of our common stock at a price per share of

Table of Contents 

 20.13, equal to our net asset value per share, as determined by us on March 29, 2022, which represented 8.71 of the total number of our outstanding shares of common stock as of May 6, 2022. 
 We entered into separate subscription agreements with qualified investors providing for the private placement of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Initial Private Offering and have entered and intend to continue to enter into separate subscription agreements with qualified investors providing for the private placement of shares of our common stock pursuant to the New Continuous Offering. We intend to have additional closings of capital commitments to purchase our common stock pursuant to the New Continuous Offering. 
 Investors whose subscription agreements are accepted by us in the New Continuous Offering will be required to fund capital calls to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective capital commitments each time we deliver a capital call notice, which will be issued based on our anticipated investment activities and capital needs and at least eight business days prior to funding. All purchases made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into pursuant to the Initial Private Offering are generally made pro rata, in accordance with the remaining capital commitments of all investors, at a per share price equal to then-current NAV per share of our common stock as determined within two business days of the applicable drawdown notice, subject to the limitations of Section 23 under the Investment Company Act (which generally prohibits us from selling shares at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock as determined within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays, of such issuance, subject to certain exceptions). 
 Drawdowns may be issued at any time prior to the expiration of the Investment Period for any permitted purpose. Any capital commitments remaining from the Initial Private Offering terminated as of the date of the first closing in connection with the New Continuous Offering, which occurred on August 2, 2022. 
 No investor who participated in the Initial Private Offering or the New Continuous Offering will be permitted to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of its shares or capital commitment unless we provide our prior written consent and the transfer is otherwise made in accordance with applicable law. 
 Certain members of our senior management team, Carlyle officers, employees, equity holders, advisors, operating executives, consultants, professionals and affiliates (collectively, the Sponsor Investors have collectively committed to invest approximately 36,000,000 in the Company in connection with the Initial Private Offering. The Sponsor Investors may, but are not required to, purchase additional Shares in connection with the New Continuous Offering. 
 On June 26, 2017, the Company entered into a placement fee arrangement with TCG Securities, L.L.C. TCG ), a licensed broker-dealer and an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, which may require stockholders to pay a placement fee to TCG for TCG s services. 
 We and our Investment Adviser have applied for exemptive relief from the SEC that, if granted, will permit us to issue in the New Continuous Offering multiple classes of shares of our common stock with varying sales loads, contingent deferred sales charges, and/or asset-based service and/or distribution fees, the details for which will be finalized at a later date at our discretion (the Multi-Class Exemptive Relief' ). The SEC has not yet granted the Multi-Class Exemptive Relief, and there is no assurance that the relief will be granted. 
 In addition, we borrow money from financial institutions and may in the future issue debt securities or preferred stock, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. See Regulation General Regulation as a Business Development Company Indebtedness and Senior Securities.

 Our Investment Adviser also serves, and may in the future serve, as investment adviser to other existing and future affiliated BDCs that have investment objectives similar to our investment objectives. 
 On June 26, 2017, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser. The initial term of the Investment Advisory Agreement was two years from June 26, 2017 and, unless terminated earlier, the Investment Advisory Agreement renewed automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance was specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board of Directors and by the vote of a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (the Independent Directors ). On October 11, 2021, the Board, including all of its Independent Directors, reviewed the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, considered the mechanics of the changes and the Investment Adviser s rationale for the changes and approved the terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement for an initial term of two years, conditional upon stockholders approval of the proposal to convert the Company to a perpetual life BDC as discussed above. 
 On January 21, 2022, stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement as discussed above, which we executed on January 22, 2022. The terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement were effective immediately upon execution of the agreement, except that the changes to the calculation of the income-based incentive fee became effective for the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2022. The Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect until January 21, 2024 and, unless terminated earlier, will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board and by the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors. The Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days written notice to the other party. 
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement and subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of two components a management fee and an incentive fee. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the management fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.00 of the Company s average Capital Under Management (as defined below) at the end of the then-current quarter and the prior calendar quarter (and, in the case of the Company s first quarter, the Company s Capital Under Management as of such quarter-end). Capital Under Management means cumulative capital called, less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital. Returned Capital means unused capital commitments increased by the aggregate amount of (i) any portion of distributions made by the Company to an investor during the Original Investment Period (as defined below) which represents (A) proceeds realized from the sale or repayment of any investment (as opposed to investment income) during the Investment Period (but not in excess of the cost of any such investment) or (B) a return of such investor s capital contributions to the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors, and (ii) any amount drawn down by the Company from unused capital commitments to pay management fees, incentive fees, organizational expenses or Company expenses, to the extent such investor receives subsequent distributions. The Original Investment Period commenced on September 11, 2017 and was scheduled to expire September 11, 2021. On January 11, 2021, the Board of Directors extended the Investment Period for one additional one-year period through September 11, 2022. On January 11, 2021, the Company, in connection with the extension of the Investment Period to September 11, 2022, entered into a letter agreement with the Investment Adviser, under which the Investment Adviser agreed that effective September 12, 2021 the annual rate of its management fee would decrease from a rate of 1.25 to 1.00 of the Company's average Capital Under Management. For the avoidance of doubt, Capital Under Management does not include capital acquired through the use of leverage, and Returned Capital does not include distributions of the Company s investment income (i.e., proceeds received in respect of interest payments, dividends or fees, net of expenses) or net realized capital gains to the investors. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement on January 12, 2022, the calculation of the annual base management fee changed to 1.00 of the Company s net asset value as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (as adjusted for capital called, dividends reinvested, distributions paid and issuer share repurchases made during the current calendar quarter). 
 Under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee consists of two parts: an income-based incentive fee and a capital gains incentive fee. Prior to January 12, 2022, the first part was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equaled 15 of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a preferred return of 1.75 per quarter (7 annualized), or hurdle rate, and a catch-up feature. The second part was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to 15 of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that no incentive fee on capital gains is payable to the Investment Adviser unless cumulative total

 return exceeded a 7 annual return on weighted average cumulative capital called less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement on January 12, 2022, the calculation of the income-based incentive fee changed by reducing the income-based incentive fee rate to 12.5 and by reducing the hurdle rate to 1.25 (5.0 annualized). The capital gains incentive fee rate was reduced to 12.5 . 
 Our Administrator

 approximately 9.2 billion of capital to-date to various Carlyle strategies. 
 Global Capital Markets. Carlyle Global Capital Markets GCM is a loan syndication and capital markets business that launched in 2018.

 Board of Directors 
 The Company s Board of Directors currently consists of seven members, four of whom are Independent Directors. The Board of Directors has established an audit committee and a pricing committee of the Board of Directors, and may establish additional committees in the future. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Carlyle Global Credit s key competitive strengths are based on Carlyle s integrated platform with a breadth of capabilities, scale of capital and depth of expertise which Carlyle believes allows it to mitigate competition and thereby improve our ability to deliver on the expectations of shareholders. We believe the following characteristics distinguish Carlyle s capabilities in private credit: 
 Proven Direct Origination Approach . Carlyle Direct Lending s business directly originates nearly 100 of its investments, sourced from both the dedicated direct lending origination team as well as from the many adjacent capabilities across the Carlyle Global Credit platform. This origination approach has resulted in a strong and diversified flow of opportunities, approximately 1,500 per annum, from which Carlyle believes it can select investments with the best potential risk/reward characteristics. 
 Breadth of Capabilities . Carlyle believes it has one of the broadest credit investment capabilities in the market today. As a global private credit platform, Carlyle has the ability to invest across the capital structure in first lien, unitranche, second lien, junior debt and preferred equity. Carlyle Global Credit can potentially serve as a one-stop shop, providing creative and holistic solutions for borrowers across the capital structure, which allows it to pursue investment opportunities with limited competition. 
 Scale of Capital. With 146.3 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2022 across its platform, Carlyle Global Credit maintains a significant capital base that can provide a full capital solution, delivering certainty of execution for borrowers and mitigating opportunities for competitive disintermediation. 
 Depth of Expertise . Carlyle is a market leading global platform with 373 billion of AUM, an experienced and tenured bench of more than 770 investment professionals with well-established, long-standing relationships with sponsors, management teams, and industry experts, as of December 31, 2022. Carlyle believes that it brings differentiated diligence insights and extensive experience to inform credit selection. As a firm, Carlyle seeks to bring the collective power of the global platform with respect to individual investments, including sector credit analysts, Carlyle Private Equity s deep knowledge and relationships with potential customers, suppliers or competitors of a given company, and internal dedicated diligence groups e.g. , government affairs and environment, social and corporate governance ESG )). Carlyle believes this integrated and collaborative approach allows it to move faster and with higher conviction than its competitors in many scenarios. 
 Rigorous Credit Selection. Carlyle employs a robust, iterative and heavily documented underwriting process for its Direct Lending business, which consists of four gates where a credit is reviewed and requires sign-off, including (i) at the point of origination, (ii) by the underwriting team, (iii) by Carlyle Direct Lending s screening committee (the Direct Lending Screening Committee or the Screening Committee and finally (iv) by Carlyle s Illiquid Credit Investment Committee at our Investment Adviser that oversees our investment activities. This rigorous diligence approach has allowed for a less than 3 closing rate on the approximately 1,500 transactions that were reviewed by the deal team over the past 12 months.

 Defensive Approach. Carlyle approaches the direct lending business with a defensive mindset that permeates all aspects of investment selection. On a strategic level, Carlyle seeks to construct well diversified portfolios, heavily weighted towards non-cyclical industries, and applies only moderate leverage at the portfolio level in order to seek to generate sustainable income levels. In addition, in individual asset selection, Carlyle favors sponsored over non-sponsored borrowers, seeks to transact with sponsors it knows well (approximately 80 of Carlyle Direct Lending s business is with repeat sponsors), works with companies it knows well via its significant incumbencies, seeks opportunities at the top of the capital structure, and primarily invests in transactions where Carlyle maintains leadership or roles with significant influence (approximately 90 of originations having a titled role in recent years). 
 Market Opportunity 
 We believe the middle market lending environment provides attractive investment opportunities as a result of a combination of the following factors: 
 Favorable Market Environment. We believe the middle market remains one of the most attractive investment areas due to its large size, superior value relative to the broadly syndicated loan market, and supply-demand imbalance that continues to favor non-bank lenders. We believe market yields remain attractive and leverage levels at middle market companies are stable, creating a favorable investment environment. 
 Large and Growing U.S. Middle Market. The middle market direct lending asset class has undergone tremendous growth and maturation over the past decade and is one of the largest sub-segments of private credit, a now 1,400+ billion market. Carlyle believes this growth has been driven by fundamentally sound, secular drivers, including the expansion of private market activity, increased bank regulation and consolidation and structural changes in liquid credit markets, all of which create a significant opportunity for private credit investing. 
 Benefits of Traditional Middle Market Focus. Carlyle believes that there are meaningful benefits to investing in middle market directly originated assets, which allows the strategy to generate excess return as compared to traditional fixed income asset classes, with comparable risk performance. The excess return is generated by prudently taking incremental complexity and illiquidity risk. Traditional middle market companies offer more attractive economics in the form of upfront fees, spreads and prepayment penalties. In addition, senior secured middle market loans typically have strong defensive characteristics and structural protections, including priority in the capital structure and covenants, with a majority of middle market loans structured with financial covenants relative to the broadly syndicated markets. Additional protection may be gained through better credit documentation and control, enhanced management and diligence access, monitoring of assets, and significantly more influence in the instance of a workout scenario. 
 Market Environment Favors Non-Traditional Lenders. The direct lending asset class has also benefited from an ongoing secular trend in the banking industry. Post Great Financial Crisis GFC in 2008, as tougher regulations have reshaped the landscape, traditional banks have reduced their lending capabilities by nearly 50 over the past ten years. As banks have retreated due to a number of new laws, regulations and regulatory guidance, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies leveraged lending guidelines and Basel III regulatory capital framework, institutional investors have increased their lending capabilities to fill the void. Post-GFC, institutional investors now originate over 80 of primary leveraged loan issuances in the U.S., generating an incremental capital opportunity for the asset class. 
 Favorable Capital Markets Trends. Over the past two decades, Carlyle has witnessed a secular trend with respect to the shift in economic activity from public to privately owned businesses due to less appetite for public market exposure. The number of public companies in the U.S. has dropped by over 50 from its peak, with a mirror image increase in the rise of private equity-backed companies. Overall public listing activity has declined by approximately two-thirds over the past forty years. These privately owned companies often prefer to finance themselves through the private markets, which has allowed for a natural expansion of the market opportunity for direct lenders on a secular basis for over a decade. Given current market dynamics, Carlyle believes that the asset class will continue to expand. 
 Investment Strategy 
 Our investment strategy is a continuation of a strategy adopted by the CDL platform. We focus on investing primarily in companies that we believe at the time of investment to be established and stable, with positive cash flow. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of investments in senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and, to a significantly lesser 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 extent, subordinated loans of private, U.S. middle market companies. We also make selective bond, preferred and common equity investments. Our Investment Adviser aims to maintain an appropriate allocation among the various types of senior secured term loans, as well as junior secured debt and unsecured subordinated debt, to allow us to achieve our returns while maintaining our desired credit risk profile. 
 We typically target portfolio companies that exhibit some or all of the following characteristics at the time of investment: 
 EBITDA of 25 100 million; 
 Minimum of 35 original sponsor cash equity in each transaction (typically higher); 
 Sustainable leading positions in their respective markets; 
 Scalable revenues and operating cash flow; 
 Experienced management teams with successful track records; 
 Stable, predictable cash flows with low technology and market risks; 
 Diversified product offering and customer base; 
 Low capital expenditures requirements; 
 A North American base of operations; 
 Strong customer relationships; 
 Products, services or distribution channels having distinctive competitive advantages; and 
 Defensible niche strategy or other barriers to entry. 
 While we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be necessarily met by each prospective portfolio company. In addition, we may change our investment objective, investment strategy and/or investment criteria over time without notice to or consent from our investors. 
 Our Investment Adviser s investment team intends to use a disciplined, credit-driven investment strategy that is a continuation of CDL s strategy, including: 
 pursuing investments in senior secured loans, and aiming to maintain the appropriate allocation among the various types of senior secured loans, as well as junior secured debt to allow us to achieve its returns while maintaining its desired credit risk profile; 
 performing in-depth due diligence on companies, management teams and sponsors, and conducting fundamental credit and valuation analyses; 
 seeking to structure investments to provide us with security, current cash pay interest, and additional upside through original issue discount OID or other fees; and 
 active management of portfolio investments through ongoing dialogue with equity owners and management, monitoring of operational results, financial reports and compliance with covenants, company visits, and periodic evaluation of potential exit alternatives for part or all of each investment. 
 Investment Criteria and Transactional Structures 
 We invest primarily in transactions supported by private equity sponsors. We seek to invest in the following types of assets, with an emphasis on senior debt: 
 traditional cash flow senior secured debt; 
 unitranche senior secured debt financings; 
 last out unitranche debt; 
 second lien senior debt; 
 traditional subordinated debt; 
 preferred and common equity co-investments; and 
 secondary and other opportunistic asset purchases. 
 As noted above, we may also from time to time participate in traditional subordinated debt financings, preferred and common equity co-investments. We may also make secondary purchases of all of the above types of investments and other securities on an opportunistic basis.

 Investment Process 
 Origination 
 The direct lending investment team s multi-channel origination model generates attractive investment opportunities through a variety of sources, including over 250 private equity firms, financial institutions, other middle market lenders, strategic relationships and arrangements, financial advisors, and experienced management teams. The origination team supplements these relationships through personal visits and marketing campaigns focused on maximizing investment deal flow. It is their responsibility to identify specific opportunities, refine opportunities through candid exploration of the underlying facts and circumstances and to apply creative and flexible solutions to solve a borrower or sponsor s financing needs. The team of origination professionals are located in New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles. Each originator maintains long-standing relationships with potential sources of deal flow and is responsible for covering a specified target market, organized by geography and secondarily by sector. Carlyle believes the originators strengths and breadth of relationships across a wide range of markets generate numerous financing opportunities, which enable it to be highly selective through its diligence and investment process, with less than 3 of total deals screened over the past 12 months closing. The direct lending investment team has cultivated very strong relationships with private equity sponsors with whom it works closely in sourcing and executing transactions. Carlyle believes that borrowers benefit from full financing solutions, access to the vast Carlyle network, and reliable execution. 
 Underwriting 
 The underwriting process is led by an experienced team of senior underwriters that are organized by sector and benefit from a deep base of shared information enabled by platform integration, as well as Carlyle resources. The typical deal timeline is sixty to ninety days and follows a multi-faceted four-step process: 
 
 1. Screening. The deal team reviews marketing materials and industry reports, compiles debt and equity comparables, reaches out to industry experts within the Carlyle network, identifies key credit strengths and risks and formulates a view on structure. The deal team then presents an initial analysis through a screening memo to the Screening Committee for high-level feedback and a decision to move forward with additional credit work. The Screening Committee is comprised of the Head of Direct Lending, the Investment Adviser s Chief Investment Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Head of Sponsor Coverage, Deputy Chief Investment Officer, and two additional senior Managing Directors. Based on feedback from the committee, the deal team will prepare and disseminate an outcomes email that documents the takeaways from the meeting, including preferred financing structure as well as terms, key diligence items and next steps. 
 2. Formal Review. Following an indication from the Screening Committee to move forward in the diligence process, the deal team will compile a detailed diligence list and prepare for in-depth credit analysis. During this process, the deal team works closely with the private equity sponsor / borrower in all aspects of due diligence. Formal due diligence includes meeting with the management team, reviewing the data room and performing key financial analyses, creating a detailed financial model with sensitivities assuming various market environments, reviewing sell-side and third-party research, which includes industry reports and financial diligence, following up with industry experts within the Carlyle network for additional feedback, and drafting the commitment papers and term sheet. 
 As part of the extensive due diligence process, the deal team fully leverages all internal Carlyle resources to aid in investment decisions. In addition, the deal team may utilize third-party expert networks to supplement their work to gain further insight into company and industry factors from various thought leaders across the company s markets. 
 Our Investment Adviser incorporates formal ESG reviews into its investment process. All deals are thoroughly vetted leveraging sector- and sub-sector-specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards. ESG diligence incorporates country risk assessments for corruption and anti-money laundering concerns as well. The underwriters are responsible for assessing these ESG risks and including their assessment in the deal memo that the Screening and Investment Committees will review. 
 The formal review part of the process is iterative and involves re-screening with members of the Screening Committee, typically two to four times over the course of the deal, to produce a fulsome investment memo and provide a full term sheet and commitment papers, subject to outstanding diligence items. 
 3. Final Investment Committee Approval. After the Screening Committee has signed off on the investment memo, the deal team prepares for the Investment Committee approval process. The deal team reviews and summarizes final third- 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 party industry work, performs outstanding ESG and regulatory due diligence, and begins drafting the definitive legal documentation for the transaction. Once the credit work for the transaction has been finalized, the deal team will finalize the investment memo and present the investment to the Investment Committee, where approval by a majority of the committee is required to approve a transaction. The Investment Committee has delegated approval of certain amendments, follow-on investments with existing borrowers, investments below certain size thresholds (existing or new platforms), and other matters as determined by the Investment Committee to the Screening Committee. 
 4. Closing. Once the investment has been approved and prior to funding, the deal team will prepare a closing memo documenting any updates since approval, changes to key legal terms, and the final financial covenant analysis. Once the sponsor / borrower legal diligence, and the know your customer, anti-money laundering and legal documentation have been finalized, the transaction will close and fund. 
 The deal team focuses on lending to companies that it believes are performing, high quality businesses with a focus on strong fundamentals, market leadership with unique competitive advantages and high barriers to entry, positive cash flow generation on a historical and pro-forma basis including downside scenarios, and modest loan-to-value across economic cycles. The deal team crafts a fulsome memo with pages including, but not limited to, diligence completed on a variety of industry, company-specific, financial and legal topics. 
 Portfolio and Risk Management 
 The investment team views proactive portfolio monitoring as a vital part of its investment process, which includes the ongoing review of a borrower by portfolio management, underwriting and workout professionals, with multiple layers of risk review and oversight. The investment team follows a rigorous monitoring strategy that utilizes a proprietary dashboard template for each transaction, which tracks financial performance, covenant compliance, follow-on transactions and amendments, and real-time updates to internal risk ratings based on qualitative and quantitative factors. The portfolio management process involves a variety of ongoing and scheduled reviews that allow for early detection of issues and escalation to the Investment Committee and workout team to avoid credit losses. This process includes detailed portfolio dashboard updates, monthly reviews of certain investments, quarterly meetings to conduct formal portfolio reviews, focused on technical analysis of financial performance and portfolio diversification, and ongoing ad-hoc meetings to handle borrower-specific requests, including follow-on transactions and amendments. 
 In connection with the quarterly portfolio reviews, the investment team also compiles a quarterly risk report that examines, among other things, migration in the portfolio and loan level investment mix, industry diversification, internal risk ratings, revenue and EBITDA and leverage. 
 Frequency of review of individual loans is determined on a case-by-case basis, based on internal risk ratings as laid out below, total exposure and other criteria set forth by the Investment Committee. The direct lending team has developed an internal risk policy which regularly assesses the risk profile of each investment and rates them based on the following categories, which are referred to as internal risk ratings. 
 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost basis is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 Beyond the policies detailed above, our Investment Adviser s investment team performs analyses and projections to assess potential exposure of the portfolio to variable macroeconomic factors and market conditions. Sample analyses include assessing (i) the impact of rising operating costs on our borrowers and end consumers due to elevated inflation, particularly in food and energy, (ii) volatility in foreign exchange rates, (iii) Russia s military invasion of Ukraine, (iv) interest rate sensitivity, (v) disruptions in our supply chain and (vi) the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These analyses can take the form of periodic (weekly/monthly/quarterly) reports as well as ad hoc analysis based on current market conditions.

 Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest 
 Our Investment Adviser, its investment professionals, our executive officers and directors, and other current and future principals of our Investment Adviser serve or may serve as investment advisers, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same line of business as we do or a related line of business and/or investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements advised by Carlyle. 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 An affiliated investment fund, account or other similar arrangement currently formed or formed in the future and managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. This creates potential conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other investment funds, accounts and similar arrangements, particularly in circumstances where the availability or liquidity of such investment opportunities is limited or where co-investments by us and other funds, accounts or arrangements are not permitted under applicable law, as discussed below. 
 For example, Carlyle sponsors several investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, including, without limitation, structured credit funds, closed-end registered investment companies, BDCs, carry funds, and managed accounts and structured credit funds it may sponsor in the future. The SEC has granted us exemptive relief that permits us and certain of our affiliates to co-invest in suitable negotiated investments (the Exemptive Relief ). If Carlyle is presented with investment opportunities that generally fall within our investment objective and other board-established criteria and those of other Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements (including other existing and future affiliated BDCs), whether focused on a debt strategy or otherwise, Carlyle allocates such opportunities among us and such other Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements in a manner consistent with the Exemptive Relief, our Investment Adviser s allocation policies and procedures and Carlyle s other allocation policies and procedures, where applicable, as discussed below. More specifically, investment opportunities in suitable negotiated investments for investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements managed by our Investment Adviser, and other funds, accounts or similar arrangements managed by affiliated investment advisers that seek to co-invest with us or other Carlyle BDCs, are allocated in accordance with the Exemptive Relief. Investment opportunities for all other investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements not managed by our Investment Adviser are allocated in accordance with their respective investment advisers and Carlyle s other allocation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures may result in certain investment opportunities that are attractive to us being allocated to other funds that are not managed by our Investment Adviser. Carlyle s, including our Investment Adviser s, allocation policies and procedures are designed to allocate investment opportunities fairly and equitably among its clients over time, taking into account a variety of factors which may include the sourcing of the transaction, the nature of the investment focus of each such other Carlyle fund, accounts or other similar arrangements, each fund s, account s or similar arrangement s desired level of investment, the relative amounts of capital available for investment, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals, any requirements contained in the limited partnership agreements and other governing agreements of the Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements and other considerations deemed relevant by Carlyle in good faith, including suitability considerations and reputational matters. The application of these considerations may cause differences in the performance of different Carlyle funds, accounts and similar arrangements that have similar strategies. 
 Because we are a BDC, we are not generally permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Carlyle or other funds managed by Carlyle. 
 We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with clients of our Investment Adviser or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Carlyle) without complying with our Exemptive Relief, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to our downstream affiliates. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Investment Adviser s and Carlyle s other allocation policies and procedures. 
 While Carlyle and our Investment Adviser seek to implement their respective allocation processes in a fair and equitable manner under the particular circumstances, there can be no assurance that it will result in equivalent allocation of or participation in investment opportunities or equivalent performance of investments allocated to us as compared to the other entities. In some cases, due to information barriers that are in place, we and other Carlyle investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements may compete with each other for specific investment opportunities without being aware that they are competing with each other. Carlyle has a conflict system in place above these information barriers to identify potential conflicts early in the process and determine if an allocation decision needs to be made or if an investment is precluded. If the conflicts system detects a potential conflict, the legal and compliance departments of Carlyle assess investment opportunities to determine whether a particular investment opportunity is required to be allocated to a particular investment fund, account or other similar arrangement (including us) or is prohibited from being allocated to a particular investment fund, account or similar arrangement. Subject to a determination by the legal and compliance departments (if applicable), portfolio management teams and, as applicable, the Investment Adviser's allocation committees, are then charged with ensuring that investment opportunities are allocated to the appropriate investment fund, account or similar arrangement in accordance with our Investment Adviser's allocation policies and procedures. In addition, in some cases Carlyle and our Investment Adviser may make investment recommendations to investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements where the investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements make the investment independently of Carlyle and our Investment Adviser. As a result, there are circumstances where investments appropriate for us are instead allocated, in whole or in part, to such other investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements irrespective of our Investment Adviser s and Carlyle s other policies and procedures

 regarding allocation of investments. Where Carlyle otherwise has discretion to allocate investment opportunities among various funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, it should be noted that Carlyle may determine to allocate such investment opportunities away from us. 
 During periods of unusual market conditions, our Investment Adviser may deviate from its normal trade allocation practices. For example, this may occur with respect to the management of unlevered and/or long-only investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements that are typically managed on a side-by-side basis with levered and/or long-short investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements. 
 For potential conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities among the Company and other investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements advised by Carlyle, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including the management of other investment funds and accounts by our Investment Adviser, which could impact our investment returns. 
 Election to be Taxed as a RIC 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. Instead, dividends we distribute generally will be taxable to the holders of our common stock, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes may not pass through to the holders of our common stock. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90 of our investment company taxable income (generally, our net ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction) for any taxable year (the Annual Distribution Requirement ). The following discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we (1) qualify as a RIC, and (2) satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our net taxable income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 In addition, if we fail to distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements ), we are liable for a 4 excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year is considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). 
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 
 continue to qualify as a BDC under the Investment Company Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or foreign currencies (the 90 Gross Income Test and 
 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 of the value of our assets or more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, or two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or of certain qualified publicly traded partnerships (the Diversification Tests ). 
 Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to raise additional debt or equity capital or sell assets to make distributions, we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, and therefore would not be able to maintain our qualification as a RIC. Additionally, we may make investments that result in the recognition of ordinary income rather than capital gain, or that prevent us from accruing a long-term holding period. These investments may prevent us from making capital gain distributions as described below. We intend to monitor our transactions, make the appropriate tax elections and make the appropriate entries in our books and records when we make any such investments in order to mitigate the effect of these rules. 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income, we would have a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, a holder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than the holder would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
 Regulation 
 General Regulation as a Business Development Company 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. 
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of: (a) 67 or more of such company s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
 As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (such directors are referred to as the Independent Directors and the directors who are not Independent Directors are referred to as the Interested Directors ). We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to certain transactions between BDCs and certain affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and certain affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. Because we are a BDC, we are not generally permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Carlyle or other funds managed by Carlyle. We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with our Investment Adviser or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Carlyle) without complying with our Exemptive Relief, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to our downstream affiliates. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Investment Adviser s allocation policies and procedures. 
 As a BDC, we are generally required to meet a minimum asset coverage ratio after each issuance of senior securities. Asset coverage generally refers to a company s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, as defined in the Investment Company Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. 
 We may invest up to 100 of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants or options to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financings or other investments. In connection with such an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. 
 We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3 of the voting stock of any investment company (unless certain conditions are satisfied), invest more than 5 of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10 of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intended status to be a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure for more information. 
 In addition, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3 of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the Investment Company Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions. 
 We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value ("NAV") per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV of our common stock if our Independent Directors determine that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Independent Directors, closely approximates the market value of such shares (less any distributing commission or discount). In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below NAV in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 
 We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act. 
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 As a BDC, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30 of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30 basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide, upon request from our portfolio companies, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Investment Adviser may provide all or a portion of this assistance pursuant to our administration agreement, the costs of which will be reimbursed by us. We may receive fees for these services. 
 Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets. We may also invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25 of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Indebtedness and Senior Securities 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 200 immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage and We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us . 
 Codes of Ethics 
 We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and our Investment Adviser has adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively (collectively, the Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics ), which establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions and apply to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics generally do not permit investments by personnel subject to them in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the SOX Code of Ethics ), which applies to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 We hereby undertake to provide a copy of these codes of ethics to any person, without charge, upon request. Requests for a copy of these codes of ethics may be made in writing addressed to the Secretary of the Company, Joshua Lefkowitz, Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc., One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, NY 10017. 
 There have been no material changes to the Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics or the SOX Code of Ethics or material waivers of the code that apply to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. 
 Compliance Policies and Procedures 
 We and our Investment Adviser have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.

Table of Contents 

 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and, starting from the date on which we are both (i) not an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 as amended (the JOBS Act and (ii) are a reporting company that meets the definition of an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and 
 pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to material weaknesses. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 Compliance with the JOBS Act 
 We currently are, and expect to remain, an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act until the earliest of: 
 up to five years measured from the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; 
 the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are 1.235 billion or more; 
 the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period; and 
 the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of the common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of any June 30. 
 Under the JOBS Act, we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As long as we remain an emerging growth company or a reporting company that does not meet the definition of an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 In addition, Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended by Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act, provide that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. These guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our Independent Directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Investment Adviser recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Our Investment Adviser will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Investment Adviser will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our Investment Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our Investment Adviser s proxy voting decisions will be made by its investment committee. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Investment Adviser will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to the Investment Committee, and Independent Directors, any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Investment Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
 Stockholders may obtain information regarding how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc., c/o Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C., One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, NY 10017. 
 Privacy Principles 
 We endeavor to maintain the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguard their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help stockholders understand what non-public personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share that information with select other parties. 
 We may collect non-public personal information about stockholders from our subscription agreements or other forms, such as name, address, account number and the types and amounts of investments, and information about transactions with us or our affiliates, such as participation in other investment programs, ownership of certain types of accounts or other account data and activity. We may disclose the non-public personal information that we collect from our stockholders or former stockholders, as described above, to our affiliates and service providers and as allowed by applicable law or regulation. Any party that receives this information from us is permitted to use it only for the services required by us and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose. We permit access only by authorized personnel who need access to that non-public personal information to provide services to us and our stockholders. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards for non-public personal information that are designed to comply with applicable law. 
 Reporting Obligations and Available Information 
 We furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as well as reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 regarding directors, officers or 10 beneficial owners of us, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange Act, are available on the SEC website, which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.

 Competition 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, CLOs, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that will not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we will face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. 
 We expect to use the expertise of the members of the Investment Committee and its investment team to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments. In addition, we expect that extensive direct origination resources, broad product capabilities, ability to commit capital in scale and the depth of expertise of our Investment Adviser s investment team will enable us to learn about and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investments We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and compete with investment vehicles sponsored or advised by our affiliates. 
 Staffing 
 We do not currently have any employees. Our Chief Financial Officer, a Managing Director of Carlyle, our Treasurer and Principal Accounting Officer, a Vice President of Carlyle, and our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, a Managing Director of Carlyle, are retained by our Administrator pursuant to the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement. Each of these professionals performs their respective functions for us under the terms of our Administration Agreement. 
 Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Investment Adviser. Our Investment Adviser has entered into a personnel agreement with Carlyle Employee Co., pursuant to which our Investment Adviser has access to the members of its investment committee, and a team of additional experienced investment professionals who, collectively, comprise the Investment Adviser s investment team. Our Investment Adviser may hire additional investment professionals to provide services to us.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 The following is only a summary of the principal risks that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The following should be read in conjunction with the complete discussion of risk factors we face, which are set forth below under " Risk Factors ". 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Structure 
 We are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty, and capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability in the future. These market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States and abroad, which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business and operations. 
 Inflation has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies. 
 Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results. 
 We are dependent upon our Investment Adviser for our future success, and there are significant potential conflicts of interest that could impact our investment returns. 
 Our financial condition, results of operations and ability to achieve our investment objective depend on our ability to source investments, access financing and manage future growth effectively. 
 We expect to raise additional capital in the near-term and may need to continue to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income and intend to continue to conduct Quarterly Tender Offers. 
 Our investors have obligations to satisfy capital calls. 
 We may be unable to pay our obligations when due if our investors fail to pay installments of their capital commitments to us when due. 
 Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC or RIC would reduce our operating flexibility, may hinder our achievement of our investment objective, may limit our investment choices and may subject us to greater regulation. 
 Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 
 We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations. 
 Changes in interest rates have increased and may in the future increase our cost of capital, reduce the ability of our portfolio companies to service their debt obligations and decrease our net investment income. 
 The discontinuation of LIBOR and the adoption of alternative reference rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. 
 We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company, as defined in the Code, certain U.S. stockholders will be treated as having received a dividend from us. 
 Our Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into one or more classes of preferred stock, which could convey special rights and privileges to its owners, and to issue conditional classes of common stock, subject to our receiving the Multi-Class Exemptive Relief from the SEC to do so. 
 Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law MGCL and of our Charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 
 Our Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. 
 We are highly dependent on information systems, and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business. 
 Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business, results of operations or those of our portfolio companies.

 Changes in laws or regulations governing our business or the businesses of our portfolio companies, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations, and any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and the businesses of our portfolio companies. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Investments 
 Our investments are risky and speculative, generally illiquid and typically do not have a readily available market price. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and compete with investment vehicles sponsored or advised by our affiliates. 
 Our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged and may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, some of our investments in such companies, and our investment portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries. 
 Declines in the prices of corporate debt securities and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets may adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our NAV through increased net unrealized depreciation. 
 To the extent we make investments in restructurings and reorganizations they may be subject to greater regulatory and legal risks than other traditional direct investments in portfolio companies. 
 We have not yet identified all of the portfolio companies we will invest in. 
 The financial projections of our portfolio companies could prove inaccurate, and the due diligence investigation that our Investment Adviser carries out with respect to an investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. 
 Our portfolio companies prepay loans from time to time, which may have the effect of reducing our investment income if the returned capital cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater yields. 
 Our ability to enter into transactions with Carlyle and our other affiliates is restricted. 
 Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our investments. 
 Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies. 
 There are certain risks associated with holding debt obligations that have original issue discount or payment-in-kind interest. 
 
 Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. 
 Quarterly Tender Offers are not guaranteed and, if implemented for any given quarter, will be for a limited number of our shares of common stock. You may not be able to sell your shares on timely basis. 
 Our common stock is subject to transfer restrictions. 
 There is a risk that our stockholders may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions to you may be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income. 
 Non-U.S. stockholders may be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends we pay. 
 
 Risk Factors 
 An investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, before you decide whether to make an investment in the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company s investment objective will be achieved or that an investor will receive a return of its capital. In addition, there will be occasions when the Investment Adviser and its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the Company. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The following considerations, in addition to the considerations set forth elsewhere herein, should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in the Company. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our NAV and the price of any other security that we may issue could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

 Risks Related to Our Business and Structure 
 We are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty, and capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability in the future. These market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States and abroad, which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business and operations. 
 U.S. capital markets continue to experience disruptions and volatility, including as a result of inflation, a rising interest rate environment, Russia s military invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in January 2023, the outstanding debt of the U.S. reached its statutory limit and the U.S. Treasury Department commenced taking extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. These events have contributed to unpredictable general economic conditions that are materially and adversely impacting the broader financial and credit markets. These and future market disruptions and/or illiquidity would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the businesses of our portfolio companies, and the broader financial and credit markets. 
 At various times, such disruptions have resulted in, and may in the future result in, a lack of liquidity in parts of the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector and the repricing of credit risk. Such conditions may occur for a prolonged period of time again, and may materially worsen in the future, including as a result of U.S. government shutdowns, or future downgrades to the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, including as a result of a default or the threat of default on its debt, or the perceived credit worthiness of the U.S. or other large global economies. In addition, the current U.S. political environment and the resulting uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. foreign investment, trade, taxation, economic, environmental and other policies under the current Administration, as well as the impact of geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China or in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets. Unfavorable economic conditions also would be expected to increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events have limited and could continue to limit our investment originations, and limit our ability to grow and could have a material negative impact on our operating results, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the fair values of our debt and equity investments. 
 In addition, the U.S. and global capital markets have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of extreme volatility and disruption during economic downturns and recessions. Trade wars and volatility in the U.S. repo market, the U.S. high yield bond markets, the Chinese stock markets and global markets for commodities may affect other financial markets worldwide. Increases to budget deficits, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, or direct and contingent sovereign debt may create concerns about the ability of certain nations to service their sovereign debt obligations and any risks resulting from any such debt crisis in Europe, the U.S. or elsewhere could have a detrimental impact on the global economy, sovereign and non-sovereign debt in certain countries and the financial condition of financial institutions generally. Austerity measures that certain countries may agree to as part of any debt crisis or disruptions to major financial trading markets may adversely affect world economic conditions, our business and the businesses of our portfolio companies. 
 The COVID-19 outbreak has led, and for an unknown period of time may continue to lead, to disruptions in local, regional, national and global economic activity, adverse effects on the functioning of financial markets, impacts on market interest rates, increases in economic and market uncertainty, and disruptions to trade and supply chains. While economic activity has improved, disruptions to supply chains may continue and significant inflation has been seen in many segments of the global economy. Recurring COVID-19 outbreaks and the spread of new COVID-19 variants may lead to the re-introduction of public health restrictions. Ineffectual vaccines and treatment options could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global economies may experience an economic downturn, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged economic downturn and uncertainty in the U.S. and other major markets. 
 Additionally, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds Rate several times over the course of 2022 and early 2023 and is expected to continue to do so while inflation remains above historical levels in the United States. These developments, along with the United States government s credit and deficit concerns, global economic uncertainties and market volatility and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, have caused and could continue to cause interest rates to be volatile, which may negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.

 Inflation has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies. 
 Certain of our portfolio companies are in industries that have been impacted by inflation. Recent inflationary pressures have increased the costs of labor, energy and raw materials and have adversely affected consumer spending, economic growth and out portfolio companies operations. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs of operations along to their customers, it could adversely affect their operating results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans, particularly if interest rates rise in response to inflation. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future realized or unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has raised, and has indicated its intent to continue raising, certain benchmark interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. See Changes in interest rates have increased and may in the future increase our cost of capital, reduce the ability of our portfolio companies to service their debt obligations and decrease our net investment income . 
 Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results. 
 Many of the portfolio companies in which we make investments may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay the loans we made to them during these periods or pay interest payments. Rising interest rates, inflation, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and supply chain disruptions heighten these risks. Therefore, our non-performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease during these periods as we are required to record our investments at their current fair value. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our and our portfolio companies funding costs, limit our and our portfolio companies access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us or our portfolio companies. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results. 
 Any deterioration of general economic conditions may lead to significant declines in corporate earnings or loan performance, and the ability of corporate borrowers to service their debt, any of which could trigger a period of global economic slowdown, and have an adverse impact on our performance and financial results, and the value and the liquidity of our investments. In an economic downturn, we could have non-performing assets or an increase in non-performing assets, and we would anticipate that the value of our portfolio would decrease during these periods. 
 A portfolio company s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the loans are due and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company s ability to meet its obligations under the debt that we hold. We may incur additional expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we will actually provide significant managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. 
 We are dependent upon our Investment Adviser for our future success. 
 We do not have any employees. We depend on the diligence, skill, judgment and network of business contacts of our Investment Adviser s investment professionals and CDL to source appropriate investments for us. We depend on members of our Investment Adviser s investment team to appropriately analyze our investments and the Investment Committee to approve and monitor our middle market portfolio investments. The Investment Committee, together with the other members of its investment team, evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and monitor our investments. Our future success will depend on the continued availability of the members of the Investment Committee and the other investment professionals available to the Investment Adviser. Neither we nor the Investment Adviser has employment agreements with these individuals or other key personnel, and we cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen business, medical, personal or other circumstances would not lead any such individual to terminate his or her relationship with us. The loss of any senior investment professionals to which our Investment Adviser has access, including members of the Investment Committee, or a significant number of the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective as well as on our financial condition and results of operations. The market for qualified professionals is extremely competitive across levels and areas of expertise, and our Investment Adviser may not be successful in its efforts to recruit, retain and motivate these professionals. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a shift to a hybrid work model and, in recruiting efforts, our Investment Adviser has seen increased focus by prospective candidates on remote and hybrid work 
 27

 arrangements and arrangements providing more flexibility, including around location. If there is a permanent shift to a longer-term fully remote model that does not require maintaining close proximity to a company s offices in the markets in which our Investment Adviser competes for talent, it may experience an even further increase in competition for talent and it may be difficult to recruit and retain investment professionals. 
 In addition, we cannot assure you that our Investment Adviser will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to Carlyle s investment professionals or its information and deal flow. If, due to extraordinary market conditions or other reasons, we and other funds managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates were to incur substantial losses, the revenues of our Investment Adviser and its affiliates may decline substantially. Such losses may hamper our Investment Adviser's and its affiliates' ability to provide the same level of service to us as it would have. Further, there can be no assurance that our Investment Adviser will replicate Carlyle s historical success, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by other Carlyle-managed funds. 
 Our financial condition, results of operations and ability to achieve our investment objective depend on our ability to source investments, access financing and manage future growth effectively. 
 Our ability to achieve our investment objective and to grow depends on our ability to acquire suitable investments and monitor and administer those investments, which depends, in turn, on our Investment Adviser s ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. 
 Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our Investment Adviser s structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and its ability to access financing for us on acceptable terms. Our Investment Adviser s investment team has substantial responsibilities under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement and in connection with managing us and certain other investment funds and accounts advised by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates, and may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time, which will increase as the number of investments grow, may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order for us to grow, Carlyle will need to hire, train, supervise, manage and retain new employees. However, we can offer no assurance that any such investment professionals will contribute effectively to the work of our Investment Adviser. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We expect to raise additional capital in the near-term and may need to continue to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income and intend to continue to conduct Quarterly Tender Offers. 
 We expect to continue to issue equity securities in connection with capital drawdowns from our investors in the New Continuous Offering and expect to continue to borrow from financial institutions in the future. We may need to continue to raise additional capital to fund growth in our investments and conduct Quarterly Tender Offers. If we fail to obtain funds from such sources or from other sources to fund our investments, it could limit our ability to grow, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. We elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our status as a RIC, among other requirements, we must distribute on a timely basis at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our RIC status. As a result, any such cash earnings may not be available to fund investment originations or repay maturing debt. 
 We may pursue growth through acquisitions or strategic investments in new businesses. Completion and timing of any such acquisitions or strategic investments may be subject to a number of contingencies and risks. There can be no assurance that the integration of an acquired business will be successful or that an acquired business will prove to be profitable or sustainable. 
 We have borrowed under credit facilities and in the future may borrow under additional debt facilities from financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding 982 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness. 
 In addition, as a BDC, our ability to borrow or issue preferred stock may be restricted if our total assets are less than 200 of our total borrowings and preferred stock. Furthermore, equity capital may be difficult to raise because, subject to some limited exceptions, as a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price per share less than NAV without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our Independent Directors. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Our investors have obligations to satisfy capital calls. 
 Capital calls will be issued by us from time to time at our discretion based upon our assessment of our needs and opportunities. To satisfy such capital calls, our investors may need to maintain a substantial portion of their commitment in assets that can be readily converted to cash. Except as specifically set forth in the subscription agreement, each investor s obligation to satisfy capital calls will be unconditional. An investor s obligation to satisfy capital calls will not in any manner be contingent upon our performance or prospects or upon any assessment thereof provided by our Investment Adviser. Capital calls may not provide all of the information an investor desires in a particular circumstance, and such information may not be made available and will not be a condition precedent for an investor to meet its funding obligation. 
 If one or more of our investors are unable to make, or are contractually excused from making, their capital calls on any one investment, the capital call of the other investors will increase accordingly, possibly materially. The fees, costs and expenses incurred by our investors in fulfilling a capital call (whether it is bank fees, wire fees, value-added tax or other applicable charge imposed on an investor (including the fees, costs and expenses incurred by an investor in converting its local currency into dollars, if applicable)) will be borne solely by such investor and will be in addition to the amounts required by capital calls (and will not be part of or otherwise reduce their commitments and/or unpaid capital commitment, as applicable). 
 We may be unable to pay our obligations when due if our investors fail to pay installments of their capital commitments to us when due. 
 If an investor fails to pay installments of its capital commitment to us when due, and if the contributions made by non-defaulting investors and borrowings by us are inadequate to cover the defaulted contribution, we may be unable to pay our obligations when due. As a result, we may be subjected to significant penalties that could materially adversely affect the returns to our investors (including non-defaulting investors). 
 Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC or RIC would reduce our operating flexibility, may hinder our achievement of our investment objective, may limit our investment choices and may subject us to greater regulation. 
 The Investment Company Act and the Code impose numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs and RICs, respectively, that do not apply to other types of investment vehicles. For example, under the Investment Company Act, we are required as a BDC to invest at least 70 of our total assets in specified types of qualifying assets, primarily in private U.S. companies or thinly-traded U.S. public companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, in order to continue to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to satisfy certain source-of-income, diversification and distribution requirements. These constraints, among others, may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective. See Item 1 Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC for additional information . 
 Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on us as a BDC by the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us and/or expose us to claims of private litigants. In addition, upon approval of a majority of our outstanding voting securities as required by the Investment Company Act, we may elect to withdraw our status as a BDC. If we decide to withdraw our election, or if we otherwise fail to qualify, or maintain our qualification, as a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act, which would subject us to additional regulatory restrictions, significantly decrease our operating flexibility and could significantly increase our cost of doing business. In addition, any such failure could cause an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 
 We may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. In addition, we may seek to securitize certain of our loans. Under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, we are permitted, as a BDC, to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 200 of total assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test, which may prohibit us from paying dividends and could prevent us from maintaining our status as a RIC or may prohibit us from repurchasing shares of our common stock. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Accordingly, any failure to satisfy this test could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, our asset coverage calculated in accordance with the Investment Company Act was 217.21 . Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of issuing senior securities, our common stockholders would also be exposed to typical risks associated with increased leverage, including an increased risk of loss resulting from increased indebtedness. 
 If we issue preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure, preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and might have other rights, preferences, or privileges more favorable than those of our common stockholders, and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. 
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below the NAV per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock if our Independent Directors determine that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our common stock are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Independent Directors, closely approximates the market value of such shares (less any distribution commission or discount). If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, including pursuant to the New Continuous Offering, then the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time will decrease, and holders of our common stock might experience dilution. 
 We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. 
 As part of our business strategy, we, including through our wholly owned subsidiaries, borrow from and may in the future issue senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders. Holders of these loans or senior securities would have fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our stockholders. If the value of our assets decreases, leverage will cause our NAV to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have without leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause our net income to decline more sharply than it would have if we had not borrowed. This decline could negatively affect our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock. 
 Our ability to service our borrowings depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our Investment Adviser s and our Board of Directors assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to obtain credit at all or on terms acceptable to us. 
 In addition to having fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders, obligations to lenders may be secured by a first priority security interest in our portfolio of investments, our cash, and/or our right to call unused capital commitments from the stockholders. In the case of a liquidation event, such as the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, lenders and other creditors would receive proceeds to the extent of their security interest before any distributions are made to our stockholders. 
 On April 1, 2019, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, the SPV, entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the SPV Credit Facility ), which was subsequently amended. On May 13, 2020, our other wholly owned subsidiary, Carlyle Credit Solutions SPV LLC SPV2 ), entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the SPV2 Credit Facility and together with the SPV Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities ), which was subsequently amended. Our Credit Facilities impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities, remedies on default and similar matters. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with the operating and financial covenants of our Credit Facilities. However, our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, although we believe we will continue to be in compliance, we cannot assure you that we will continue to comply with the covenants in our Credit Facilities. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default. If we were unable to obtain a waiver of a default from the lenders or holders of that indebtedness, as applicable, those lenders or holders could accelerate repayment under that indebtedness, which may result in cross-acceleration of other indebtedness. An acceleration could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Lastly, we may be unable to obtain additional leverage, which would, in turn, affect our return on capital. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2022, we had 982 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Facilities. Our weighted average effective interest rate as of December 31, 2022, was 6.00 , excluding fees (such as fees on undrawn amounts and amortization of upfront fees). Since we generally pay interest at a floating rate on our Credit Facilities, an increase in interest rates will generally increase our borrowing costs. 
 The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns on our portfolio, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical, and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below.

 Based on an outstanding indebtedness of 982.4 million as of December 31, 2022, and the weighted average effective interest rate, excluding fees (such as fees on undrawn amounts and amortization of financing costs), of 6.00 as of that date, our investment portfolio at fair value would have had to produce an annual return of approximately 2.68 to cover annual interest payments on the outstanding debt. For more information on our indebtedness, see Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations. 
 We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before it matures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or seeking additional equity. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would not be disadvantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements. 
 Changes in interest rates have increased and may in the future increase our cost of capital, reduce the ability of our portfolio companies to service their debt obligations and decrease our net investment income. 
 General interest rate fluctuations and changes in credit spreads on floating rate loans may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our rate of return on invested capital, our net investment income and our NAV. Substantially all of our debt investments have variable interest rates that reset periodically based on benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or L ), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and the U.S. Prime Rate Prime Rate or P ), so an increase in interest rates from their historically low levels may make it more difficult for our portfolio companies to service their obligations under the debt investments that we hold. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. To address ongoing concerns about inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates over the course of 2022 and currently is expected to do so in 2023. 
 Furthermore, because we typically borrow money to make investments, our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income to the extent we use debt to finance our investments. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. 
 In general, rising interest rates will negatively impact the price of a fixed rate debt instrument and falling interest rates will have a positive impact on price. Adjustable rate instruments also react to interest rate changes in a similar manner, although generally to a lesser degree (depending, however, on the characteristics of the reset terms, including the index chosen, 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 frequency of reset and reset caps or floors, among other factors). Interest rate sensitivity is generally more pronounced and less predictable in instruments with uncertain payment or prepayment schedules. 
 In addition, a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, the recent increases in interest rates have made it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate in our Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement and have resulted in increases in the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Adviser with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our distribution rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. 
 The discontinuation of LIBOR and the adoption of alternative reference rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 The UK Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act enacted in March 2022 provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. 
 SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside the U.S. The Bank of England s current nominated replacement for GBP-LIBOR is the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate SONIA ). Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, including SONIA, there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate. 
 In any event, LIBOR, to the extent it is published, is likely to perform differently than in the past and, ultimately, cease to exist as a global benchmark going forward. Until an alternative benchmark rate(s) becomes generally accepted and regularly implemented in the market, the uncertainty as to the future of LIBOR, its eventual phase-out, the transition to one or more alternate benchmark rate(s), and the implementation of such new benchmark rate(s) may impact a number of factors, which, either alone or in the aggregate, may cause a material adverse effect on our performance and our ability to achieve its investment objective. The Investment Adviser does not have prior experience in investing during a period of benchmark rate transition and there can be no assurance that the Investment Adviser will be able to manage our business in a profitable manner before, during or after such transition. 
 The discontinuance of LIBOR will require us to renegotiate credit agreements entered into prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR with our portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, in order to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to receive attractive returns. 
 If we are unable to do so, amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities may bear interest at a higher rate, which would increase the cost of our borrowings and, in turn, affect our return on capital. 
 Depending on several factors, including those set forth above, and the related costs of negotiating and documenting necessary changes to documentation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by the market transition or reform of certain reference rates and benchmarks. Other factors include the pace of the transition to replacement or reformed rates, the specific terms and parameters for and market acceptance of any alternative reference rates, prices and liquidity of trading markets for products based on alternative reference rates, and our ability to transition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates. 
 We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. 
 We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including, the pace at which investments are made, the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, rates of repayment, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses and changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.

 There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including the management of other investment funds and accounts by our Investment Adviser, which could impact our investment returns and the holders of our common stock. 
 Our executive officers and directors, other current and future principals of our Investment Adviser and certain members of the Investment Committee currently serve, and may continue to serve, as officers, directors or principals of other entities and affiliates of our Investment Adviser and funds managed by our affiliates that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do. Currently, our executive officers, as well as the other principals of our Investment Adviser manage other funds affiliated with Carlyle, including other existing and future affiliated BDCs. In addition, our Investment Adviser s investment team has responsibilities for sourcing and managing investments for certain other investment funds and accounts. Accordingly, they have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interests of, or may be adverse to the interests of, us or our stockholders. Although the professional staff of our Investment Adviser will devote as much time to our management as appropriate to enable our Investment Adviser to perform its duties in accordance with the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among us, on the one hand, and investment vehicles managed by Carlyle or one or more of its affiliates on the other hand. 
 Our Investment Adviser and its affiliated investment managers may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and affiliated investment vehicles that have overlapping objectives with ours. For example, certain affiliated investment vehicles may have arrangements that provide for higher management or incentive fees, greater expense reimbursements or overhead allocations, or permit the Investment Adviser and its affiliates to receive transaction fees not permitted under the Investment Company Act, all of which may contribute to this conflict of interest and create an incentive for our Investment Adviser or its affiliated investment managers to favor such other accounts. Furthermore, our Investment Adviser and its affiliated investment managers may form vehicles for the benefit of third-party investors that will be entitled to a portion of the allocation with respect to an investment. Such co-investment rights could result in us being allocated a smaller share of an investment than would otherwise be the case in the absence of such co-investment rights. Although our Investment Adviser will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with its allocation policies and procedures, it is possible that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment funds managed by our Investment Adviser or an investment manager affiliated with our Investment Adviser, including Carlyle. 
 We and our affiliates own, and may continue to own, investments at different levels of a portfolio company s capital structure or otherwise own different classes of a portfolio company s securities, which may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest. Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding our portfolio may benefit our affiliates. Our affiliates may pursue or enforce rights with respect to one of our portfolio companies, and those activities may have an adverse effect on us. 
 It is possible that Carlyle or an affiliated investment vehicle will invest in a company that is or becomes a competitor of a portfolio company of ours. Such investment could create a conflict between us, on the one hand, and Carlyle or the affiliated investment vehicle, on the other hand. In such a situation, Carlyle or our Investment Adviser may also have a conflict in the allocation of its own resources to our portfolio company. In addition, certain affiliated investment vehicles will be focused primarily on investing in other funds that may have strategies that overlap and/or directly conflict and compete with us. 
 As a result of the expansion of Carlyle s platform into various lines of business in the alternative asset management industry, Carlyle is subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest and subject to greater regulatory oversight than that to which it would otherwise be subject if it had just one line of business. In addition, as Carlyle expands its platform, the allocation of investment opportunities among its investment funds, including us, is expected to become more complex. In addressing these conflicts and regulatory requirements across Carlyle s various businesses, Carlyle has implemented, and may continue to implement, certain policies and procedures. For example, Carlyle has established an information barrier between Carlyle Global Credit, on the one hand, and the rest of Carlyle, on the other, which generally restricts the communications of Carlyle Global Credit with other Carlyle investment professionals pursuant to the information barrier policy. In addition, we may come into possession of material non-public information with respect to issuers in which we may be considering making an investment. As a consequence, we may be precluded from providing such information or other ideas to other funds affiliated with Carlyle that may benefit from such information or we may be precluded from otherwise consummating a contemplated investment. To the extent we or any other funds affiliated with Carlyle fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation or Carlyle s reputation and our ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter, and may continue to enter, into transactions with affiliates and portfolio companies that may be considered related party transactions. We have implemented certain policies and procedures whereby 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 certain of our executive officers screen each of our transactions for any possible affiliations between the proposed portfolio investment, us and other affiliated persons, including our Investment Adviser, stockholders that own more than 5 of us, employees, officers and directors of us and our Investment Adviser and certain persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with the foregoing persons. We will not enter into any agreements unless and until we are satisfied that doing so will not raise concerns under the Investment Company Act or, if such concerns exist, we have taken appropriate actions to seek Board of Directors review and approval or SEC exemptive relief for such transactions. 
 In the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to our Investment Adviser and reimburse our Investment Adviser for certain expenses it incurs in accordance with our Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement. The base management fee is based on our gross assets and the incentive fee is paid on income, both of which include leverage. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in a lower rate of return than an investor might achieve through direct investments. Because the management fee is based on gross assets, our Investment Adviser benefits to the extent we incur debt or use leverage. Accordingly, there may be times when the senior management team of our Investment Adviser has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict. 
 In addition, we pay our Administrator, an affiliate of our Investment Adviser, its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer) and their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and internal audit staff in their role of performing our Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control assessment. These arrangements create conflicts of interest that our Board of Directors monitors. Despite Carlyle s good faith judgment to arrive at a fair and reasonable expense allocation methodology, the use of any particular methodology may lead us to bear relatively more expense in certain instances and relatively less in other instances compared to what we would have borne if a different methodology had been used. However, Carlyle seeks to make allocations that are equitable on an overall basis in its good faith judgment. 
 We may be obligated to pay our Investment Adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a loss. 
 Our Investment Adviser is entitled to incentive compensation for each calendar quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for that quarter (before deducting incentive compensation) above a performance threshold for that quarter. In calculating our performance threshold, we use net assets which results in a lower hurdle rate than if we used gross assets like we do for determining our base management fee. Our pre-incentive fee net investment income for incentive compensation purposes excludes realized and unrealized capital losses and depreciation that we may incur in the calendar quarter, even if such capital losses or depreciation result in a net loss on our statement of operations for that quarter. Thus, we may be required to pay our Investment Adviser incentive compensation for a calendar quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or we incur a net loss for that quarter. 
 Our fee structure may induce our Investment Adviser to pursue speculative investments and incur leverage, and investors may bear the cost of multiple levels of fees and expenses. 
 The incentive fees payable by us to our Investment Adviser may create an incentive for our Investment Adviser to pursue investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The incentive fees payable to our Investment Adviser are calculated based on a percentage of our return on invested capital. This may encourage our Investment Adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. In particular, a portion of the incentive fees payable to the Investment Adviser is calculated based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a hurdle rate of 1.25 per quarter (5 annualized) and a catch-up feature. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, an increase in leverage may make it easier for the Company to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the income-based incentive fee and may result in an increase in the amount of income-based incentive fee payable to the Investment Adviser. 
 Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would impair the value of our common stock. In addition, our Investment Adviser receives the incentive fees based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike that portion of the incentive fees based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fees based on net capital gains. As a result, our Investment Adviser may have incentive to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 The catch-up portion of the incentive fees may encourage our Investment Adviser to accelerate or defer interest payable by portfolio companies from one calendar quarter to another, potentially resulting in fluctuations in timing and dividend amounts. 
 Additionally, the incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser may create an incentive for our Investment Adviser to cause us to realize capital gains or losses that may not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Under the incentive fee structure, our Investment Adviser benefits when we recognize capital gains and, because our Investment Adviser determines when an investment is sold, our Investment Adviser controls the timing of the recognition of such capital gains. Our Board of Directors is charged with protecting our stockholders interests by monitoring how our Investment Adviser addresses these and other conflicts of interest associated with its management services and compensation. 
 We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds, and, to the extent we so invest, bear our ratable share of any such investment company s expenses, including management and performance fees. We also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to our Investment Adviser with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of other investment companies. With respect to each of these investments, each of our stockholders bears his or her share of the management and incentive fees of our Investment Adviser as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which we invest. 
 We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 Although we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain RIC status. To maintain RIC status and be relieved of U.S. federal income taxes on income and gains distributed to our stockholders, we must, among other things, have in effect an election to be treated, and continue to qualify, as a BDC under the Investment Company Act at all times during each taxable year and meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the 90 Gross Income Test and the Diversification Tests (each as defined and explained more fully in Item 1. Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC. ). 
 If we fail to maintain our RIC status for any reason, and we do not qualify for certain relief provisions under the Code, we would be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes) regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In this event, the resulting taxes and any resulting penalties could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of our income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions to our stockholders, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. For additional discussion regarding the tax implications of a RIC, see Item 1. Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC for additional information. 
 A portion of our income and fees may not be qualifying income for purposes of the income source requirement. 
 Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the income source requirement applicable to RICs. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy such requirement, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce the amount of income available for distribution. 
 If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company, as defined in the Code, certain U.S. stockholders will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholders allocable share of the management and incentive fees paid to our Investment Adviser and certain of our other expenses. 
 We expect to be treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company as a result of shares of our common stock being held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. However, we cannot assure you that we will be treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for all years. If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for any calendar year, each U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholder s allocable share of the management and incentive fees paid to our Investment Adviser and certain of our other expenses for the calendar year, and these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of such U.S. stockholder. Miscellaneous itemized deductions generally are deductible by a U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate only for tax years of such U.S. stockholder beginning after 2025 and only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. stockholder s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2 of such U.S. stockholder s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are not deductible for purposes of the alternative 
 35

 minimum tax and are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under the Code. See Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC for additional information. 
 If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, including the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will not be required to comply with all of the requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the date (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and (ii) we are a reporting company that meets the definition of an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our internal controls over financial reporting do not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that we may eventually be required to meet. Specifically, we are required to conduct annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the date (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and (ii) we are a reporting company that does not meet the definition of an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. If we are not able to implement the applicable requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our operations, financial reporting or financial results could be adversely affected. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC, and result in a breach of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our financing arrangements. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could materially adversely affect us. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our operations, financial reporting or financial results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. 
 Certain investors are limited in their ability to make significant investments in us. 
 Private funds that are excluded from the definition of investment company either pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act are restricted from acquiring directly or through a controlled entity more than 3 of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless certain conditions are satisfied. Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act and BDCs are also subject to this restriction as well as other limitations under the Investment Company Act that would restrict the amount that they are able to invest in our securities. As a result, certain investors will be limited in their ability to make significant investments in us at a time that they might desire to do so. 
 Our Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into one or more classes of preferred stock, which could convey special rights and privileges to its owners, and to issue conditional classes of common stock, subject to our receiving the Multi-Class Exemptive Relief from the SEC to do so. 
 Under the MGCL and our Charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to classify and reclassify any authorized but unissued shares of stock into one or more classes of stock, including preferred stock, and other classes of common stock, subject to our receiving the Multi-Class Exemptive Relief from the SEC to do so . Prior to the issuance of shares of each class or series, the Board of Directors is required by Maryland law and our Charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Thus, the Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. The cost of any such reclassification would be borne by our existing common stockholders. Certain matters under the Investment Company Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock. For example, holders of preferred stock 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 would vote separately from the holders of common stock on a proposal to cease operations as a BDC. In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote separately from holders of common stock to elect two preferred stock directors. We currently have no plans to issue preferred stock, but may determine to do so in the future. The issuance of preferred stock convertible into shares of common stock might also reduce the net income per share and NAV per share of our common stock upon conversion, provided, that we will only be permitted to issue such convertible preferred stock to the extent we comply with the requirements of Section 61 of the Investment Company Act. In addition, under the Investment Company Act, participating preferred stock and preferred stock constitutes a senior security for purposes of the 200 asset coverage test. These effects, among others, could have an adverse effect on an investment in our common stock. 
 Provisions of the MGCL and of our Charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 
 The MGCL and our Charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of us or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act MBCA ), subject to any applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act. Our Board of Directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the MBCA any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our Board of Directors, including approval by a majority of our Independent Directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our Board of Directors does not approve a business combination, the MBCA may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act Control Share Act acquisitions of our stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Control Share Act, the Control Share Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such a transaction. However, we will amend our bylaws to be subject to the Control Share Act only if our Board of Directors determines that it would be in our best interests and if the SEC staff does not object to our determination that our being subject to the Control Share Act does not conflict with the Investment Company Act. 
 We have also adopted measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our Charter classifying our Board of Directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and authorizing our Board of Directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, to amend our Charter without stockholder approval and to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our Charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Our Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. 
 Our Board of Directors has the authority to modify or, if applicable, waive our investment objectives, operating policies and strategies without prior notice (except as required by the Investment Company Act) and without stockholder approval. In addition, none of our investment policies is fundamental and any of them may be changed without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current investment objectives, operating policies or strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our stock. Nevertheless, the effects may adversely affect our business and impact our ability to make distributions. 
 We are highly dependent on information systems, and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may in turn, negatively affect our business and our ability to pay dividends. 
 Our business is highly dependent on the communications and information systems of our Investment Adviser, its affiliates and third parties. Any failure or interruption of those systems or services, including as a result of the termination or suspension of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be: 
 sudden electrical or telecommunications outages; 
 natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 disease pandemics; 
 events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and 
 cyber-attacks. 
 These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect our business and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. 
 Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or those of our portfolio companies by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information and/or damage to business relationships, or those of our portfolio companies, all of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Cyber incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level and are expected to continue to increase in frequency and severity in the future. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to, use, alteration or destruction of our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, obtaining ransom payments, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption, or may involve phishing. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen information, misappropriation of assets, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships. This could result in significant losses, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. The costs related to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified. As our and our portfolio companies reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by our Investment Adviser and third-party service providers, and the information systems of our portfolio companies. We, our Investment Adviser and its affiliates have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, may be ineffective and do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. 
 Third parties with which we do business (including, but not limited to, service providers, such as accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators, and the issuers of securities in which we invest) may also be sources or targets of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information and assets, as well as certain investor, counterparty, employee and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, we cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by these third parties and ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure or destruction of data, or other cybersecurity incidents, with increased costs and other consequences, including those described above. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may also result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. 
 Changes in laws or regulations governing our business or the businesses of our portfolio companies, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations, and any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and the businesses of our portfolio companies. 
 We and our portfolio companies are subject to laws and regulations at the U.S. federal, state and local levels and, in some cases, foreign levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws, regulations and interpretations may also come into effect. Any such new or changed laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or the business of our portfolio companies. The legal, tax and regulatory environment for BDCs, investment advisers and the instruments that they utilize (including derivative instruments) is continuously evolving. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding recently enacted legislation and the regulations that have recently been adopted and future regulations that may or may not be adopted pursuant to such legislation and, consequently, the full impact that such legislation will ultimately have on us and the markets in which we trade and invest is not fully known. Such uncertainty and any resulting confusion may itself be detrimental to the efficient functioning of the markets and the success of certain investment strategies. 
 38

 In addition, as private equity firms become more influential participants in the U.S. and global financial markets and economy generally, there recently has been pressure for greater governmental scrutiny and/or regulation of the private equity industry. It is uncertain as to what form and in what jurisdictions such enhanced scrutiny and/or regulation, if any, on the private equity industry may ultimately take. Therefore, there can be no assurance as to whether any such scrutiny or initiatives will have an adverse impact on the private equity industry, including our ability to effect operating improvements or restructurings of our portfolio companies or otherwise achieve our objectives. 
 Over the last several years, there also has been an increase in regulatory attention to the extension of credit outside of the traditional banking sector, raising the possibility that some portion of the non-bank financial sector will be subject to new regulation. While it cannot be known at this time whether any regulation will be implemented or what form it will take, increased regulation of non-bank credit extension could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Our ability to continue to operate depends on the services provided by our Investment Adviser, Administrator and sub-administrators. Each is able to resign upon 60 days notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Our ability to continue to operate depends on the services provided by our Investment Adviser, Administrator and sub-administrators. Our Investment Adviser, our Administrator, and our sub-administrators each have the right to resign under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement and the Sub-Administration Agreements, respectively, upon 60 days written notice, whether a replacement has been found or not. If any of them resigns, it may be difficult to find a replacement with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If a replacement is not found quickly, our business, results of operations and financial condition as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the value of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Investment Adviser, our Administrator and their affiliates, including certain of our sub-administrators. Even if a comparable service provider or individuals performing such services are retained, whether internal or external, their integration into our business and lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the termination by our Investment Adviser of our Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement for any reason will be an event of default under the SPV Credit Facility or SPV2 Credit Facility, which could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the SPV Credit Facility or SPV2 Credit Facility. 
 Our Investment Adviser s liability is limited under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, and we are required to indemnify our Investment Adviser against certain liabilities, which may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 
 Our Investment Adviser has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, and it will not be responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in declining to follow our Investment Adviser s advice or recommendations. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, our Investment Adviser and its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members and any other person or entities affiliated with it will not be liable to us for their acts under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties. We have agreed to indemnify, defend and protect our Investment Adviser and its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members and any other person or entities affiliated with it with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of our Investment Adviser s duties or obligations under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as an Investment Adviser for us, and not arising out of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement. These protections may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. See Our fee structure may induce our Investment Adviser to pursue speculative investments and incur leverage, and investors may bear the cost of multiple levels of fees and expenses. for additional information.

 Risks Related to Our Investments 
 Our investments are risky and speculative. 
 We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt, if rated, is rated below investment grade and, if not rated, would likely be rated below investment grade if it were rated. Investments rated below investment grade are generally considered higher risk than investment grade instruments. Bonds that are rated below investment grade are sometimes referred to as high yield bonds or junk bonds. Exposure to below investment grade instruments involves certain risks, including speculation with respect to the borrower s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In our first lien loans, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies. To the extent we hold second lien senior secured loans and junior debt investments, holders of first lien loans may be repaid before us in the event of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding. This may result in an above average amount of risk and loss of principal. Unitranche loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a heightened risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. When we invest in loans, we have acquired and may in the future acquire equity securities as well. However, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. 
 Some of the loans in which we may invest may be covenant-lite loans, which means the loans contain fewer covenants than other loans (in some cases, none) and may not include terms which allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower and declare a default if certain criteria are breached. An investment by us in a covenant-lite loan may potentially hinder the ability to reprice credit risk associated with the issuer and reduce the ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. We may also experience delays in enforcing our rights under covenant-lite loans. As a result of these risks, our exposure to losses may be increased, which could result in an adverse impact on our net income and net asset value. 
 In addition, investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, including: 
 these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing on any guarantees or security we may have obtained in connection with our investment; 
 they typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns; 
 they are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on a portfolio company and, in turn, on us; 
 there is generally little public information about these companies. These companies and their financial information are usually not subject to the Exchange Act and other regulations that govern public companies, and we may be unable to uncover all material information about these companies, which may prevent us from making a fully informed investment decision and cause us to lose money on our investments; 
 they generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. In addition, our executive officers, directors and our Investment Adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies; 
 changes in laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, may adversely affect their business, financial structure or prospects; and 
 they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity.

 Our portfolio securities are generally illiquid and typically do not have a readily available market price and, in such a case, we will value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors or its designee, which valuation is inherently subjective and may not reflect what we may actually realize from the sale of the investment. 
 Substantially all of our portfolio investments are in the form of debt investments that are not publicly traded and are illiquid compared to publicly traded securities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize returns on such investments in a timely manner. The fair value of these illiquid portfolio securities is not readily determinable, and the due diligence process that our Investment Adviser undertakes in connection with our investments may not reveal all the facts that may be relevant in connection with such investment. Effective September 8, 2022, the Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, determines in good faith the fair value of our investment portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available. The Investment Adviser values these investments on at least a quarterly basis in accordance with our valuation policy, which is at all times consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Our Board of Directors utilizes the services of a third-party valuation firm to aid it in reviewing the determinations of our Investment Adviser s investment professionals, which are based upon the most recent portfolio company financial statements available and projected financial results of each portfolio company. The participation of our Investment Adviser in our valuation process, and the indirect pecuniary interest in our Investment Adviser by the Interested Directors on our Board of Directors, could result in a conflict of interest, because the management fee is based on our gross assets and also because our Investment Adviser is receiving performance-based incentive fees. 
 The factors that are considered in the fair value pricing of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow, relevant credit market indices, and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our Investment Adviser s determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Also, since these valuations are, to a large extent, based on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of private information, it could make it more difficult for investors to value accurately our investments and could lead to undervaluation or overvaluation of our securities. In addition, the valuation of these types of securities may result in substantial write-downs and earnings volatility. If our Investment Adviser is unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. 
 Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. The effect of all of these factors on our portfolio can reduce our NAV by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and may suffer unrealized losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our NAV as of a particular date may be materially greater than or less than the value that would be realized if our assets were to be liquidated as of such date. For example, if we were required to sell a certain asset or all or a substantial portion of our assets on a particular date, the actual price that we would realize upon the disposition of such asset or assets could be materially less than the value of such asset or assets as reflected in our NAV. Volatile market conditions could also cause reduced liquidity in the market for certain assets, which could result in liquidation values that are materially less than the values of such assets as reflected in our NAV. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and compete with investment vehicles sponsored or advised by our affiliates. 
 The activity of identifying, completing and realizing attractive investments is highly competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty. The availability of investment opportunities generally will be subject to market conditions. In particular, in light of changes in such conditions, including changes in long-term interest rates, certain types of investments may not be available to us on terms that are as attractive as the terms on which opportunities were available to previous investment programs sponsored by Carlyle. A number of entities, including BDCs managed by our Investment Adviser or an affiliate, compete with us to make the types of investments that we target in middle market companies. We compete with other BDCs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds, some of which are affiliates of us. Furthermore, over the past several years, an ever-increasing number of debt and credit opportunities funds have been formed and many such existing funds have grown 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 substantially in size. Additional funds with similar objectives may be formed in the future by Carlyle or by other unrelated parties. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Consequently, it is possible that competition for appropriate investment opportunities may increase, thus reducing the number of investment opportunities available to us and adversely affecting the terms upon which investments can be made. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. The competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and, accordingly, we may incur legal, due diligence and other costs on investments which may not be successful and we may not recover all of our costs, which would adversely affect returns. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. 
 We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors pricing, terms and structure. However, if we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss. 
 Our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged. 
 Some of our portfolio companies are highly leveraged, which may have adverse consequences to these companies and to us as an investor. These companies may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants and the leverage may impair these companies ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, these companies flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities may be limited. Further, a leveraged company s income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed money were not used. Moreover, rising interest rates may significantly increase a company's or project's interest expense, or a significant industry downturn may affect a company's ability to generate positive cash flow, in either case causing an inability of a leveraged company to service outstanding debt. In the event such leveraged company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet debt obligations, the company may default on its loan agreements or be forced into bankruptcy resulting in a restructuring or liquidation of the company. Leveraged companies may enter into bankruptcy proceedings at higher rates than companies that are not leveraged. 
 Depending on the facts and circumstances of our investments and the extent of our involvement in the management of a portfolio company, upon the bankruptcy of a portfolio company, a bankruptcy court may recharacterize our debt investments as equity interests and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. This could occur even though we may have structured our investment as senior debt. 
 Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, some of our investments in such companies and if there is a default, we may experience a loss on our investment. 
 To the extent we invest in second lien, mezzanine or other instruments, our portfolio companies typically may be permitted to incur other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, such debt instruments. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we will be entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. In such cases, after repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have sufficient remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. 
 The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing the debt investments we make in our portfolio companies with senior debt outstanding may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights are adversely affected. 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 We may also make unsecured loans to portfolio companies. Liens on such portfolio companies collateral, if any, will secure the portfolio company s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under its secured loan agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured loan obligations after payment in full of all secured loan obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured loan obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors claims against the portfolio company s remaining assets, if any. 
 Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry. 
 We are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, which means that we are not limited by the Investment Company Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer, excluding limitations on investments in other investment companies. Although we do not intend to focus our investments in any specific industries, our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and under the Credit Facilities, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and while we do not target any specific industries, our investments may be concentrated in relatively few industries. As a result, the aggregate returns we will realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of one or more investments. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could also significantly impact our aggregate returns. 
 Declines in the prices of corporate debt securities and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets may adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our NAV through increased net unrealized depreciation. 
 As a BDC, we are required to account for our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors, which has appointed our Investment Adviser as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and suffer additional unrealized losses, which would reduce our NAV and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 To the extent we make investments in restructurings and reorganizations they may be subject to greater regulatory and legal risks than other traditional direct investments in portfolio companies. 
 We have in the past and may in the future make investments in restructurings that involve, or otherwise invest in the debt securities of, companies that are experiencing or are expected to experience severe financial difficulties. These severe financial difficulties may never be overcome and may cause such companies to become subject to bankruptcy proceedings. As such, these investments could subject us to certain additional potential liabilities that may exceed the value of our original investment therein. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful financing to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. 
 We have not yet identified all of the portfolio companies we will invest in. 
 We have not yet identified all of the potential investments for our portfolio that we will acquire with the proceeds of our private offerings. Our Investment Adviser will select our investments over time. Our stockholders will have no input with respect to investment decisions. These factors increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our common stock. 
 The financial projections of our portfolio companies could prove inaccurate. 
 We generally evaluate the capital structure of portfolio companies on the basis of financial projections prepared by the management of such portfolio companies. These projected operating results are normally based primarily on judgments of the management of the portfolio companies. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. General economic conditions, which are not predictable with 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 accuracy, along with other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of the financial projections that were used to establish a given portfolio company s capital structure. Because of the leverage that is typically employed by our portfolio companies, this could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our investment in the portfolio company. The inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our performance to fall short of our expectations. 
 In addition, when sourcing debt investments, we expect to rely significantly upon representations made to us by the borrower. There can be no assurance that such representations are accurate or complete, or that any due diligence undertaken would identify any misrepresentation or omission. 
 The due diligence investigation that our Investment Adviser carries out with respect to an investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. 
 Before we make investments, our Investment Adviser will typically conduct due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. Due diligence may entail evaluation of important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants, credit rating agencies, investment banks and other third parties may be involved in the due diligence process to varying degrees depending on the type of investment. When conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, our Investment Adviser will rely on the resources available to it, including information provided by the portfolio companies and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. In addition, investment analyses and decisions by our Investment Adviser may be required to be undertaken on an expedited basis to take advantage of certain investment opportunities. In such cases, the information available to our Investment Adviser at the time of making an investment decision may be limited. The due diligence investigation that our Investment Adviser carries out with respect to an investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. Moreover, the due diligence investigation does not ensure that such investment will be successful. In addition, Carlyle's Environmental, Social and Governance program may cause us not to make an investment we otherwise would have made or impact other action taken or refrained from. 
 Our portfolio companies prepay loans from time to time, which may have the effect of reducing our investment income if the returned capital cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater yields. 
 Loans are generally prepayable at any time, most of them at no premium to par. We are generally unable to predict the rate and frequency of such repayments. Whether a loan is prepaid will depend both on the continued positive performance of the portfolio company and the existence of favorable financing market conditions that allow such portfolio company the ability to replace existing financing with less expensive capital. In periods of rising interest rates, the risk of prepayment of floating rate loans may increase if other financing sources are available. As market conditions change frequently, we will often be unable to predict when, and if, this may be possible for each of our portfolio companies. In the case of some of these loans, having the loan called early may have the effect of reducing our actual investment income below our expected investment income if the capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater yields. 
 Our ability to enter into transactions with Carlyle and our other affiliates is restricted. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We and any company controlled by us, on the one hand, and our upstream affiliates, or our Investment Adviser and its affiliates, on the other hand, are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions without the prior approval of our Independent Directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5 or more of our outstanding voting securities is our upstream affiliate for purposes of the Investment Company Act, and we or a company controlled by us are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security (other than our securities) from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of our Independent Directors and so long as such person does not own more than 25 of our outstanding voting securities or otherwise control us. We or a company controlled by us are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to our Investment Adviser or its affiliates, or any person who owns more than 25 of our voting securities or is otherwise deemed to control, be controlled by, or be under common control with, us, with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. 
 The Investment Company Act also prohibits certain joint transactions with our upstream affiliates, or our Investment Adviser or its affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our Independent Directors and, in some cases, the SEC (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance as described below). The analysis of whether a particular transaction constitutes a joint transaction requires a review of the relevant facts and circumstances then existing. The SEC has granted us Exemptive Relief that permits us and certain present and future funds advised by our Investment Adviser and certain other present and future 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 investment advisers controlling, controlled by or under common control with our Investment Adviser to co-invest in suitable negotiated investments. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. In addition to co-investing pursuant to our Exemptive Relief, we may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, our Investment Adviser s allocation procedures and Carlyle s other allocation policies and procedures, where applicable. For example, we may invest alongside such investors consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting us and an affiliated person to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that we negotiate no term other than price. We may, in certain cases, also make investments in securities owned by affiliates that we acquire from non-affiliates. In such circumstances, our ability to participate in any restructuring of such investment or other transaction involving the issuer of such investment may be limited, and as a result, we may realize a loss on such investments that might have been prevented or reduced had we not been restricted in participating in such restructuring or other transaction. 
 Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our investments. 
 Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we have made, and may continue to make, additional investments in that portfolio company as follow-on investments to: 
 increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; 
 exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or 
 attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment. 
 We may elect not to make follow-on investments, may be constrained in our ability to employ available funds, or otherwise may lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. However, doing so could be placing even more capital at risk in existing portfolio companies. 
 The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful investment. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status. 
 The disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities. 
 A significant portion of our investments involve private securities. In connection with the disposition of an investment in private securities, we may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. We may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to potential liabilities. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities that ultimately result in funding obligations that we must satisfy through our return of distributions previously made to us. 
 Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments. 
 Although we may do so in the future, currently we do not intend to hold controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. Accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions relating to a minority equity investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the portfolio company and the timing and nature of any exit. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and that the management and/or stockholders of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity of the investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result. 
 45

 Our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments. 
 Our investment strategy contemplates that a portion of our investments may be in securities of foreign companies. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. These risks are likely to be more pronounced for investments in companies located in emerging markets and particularly for middle-market companies in these economies. 
 Although most of our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency may change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk or, that if we do, such strategies will be effective. 
 We may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions. 
 If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, credit default swaps, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates, credit risk premiums, and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation at an acceptable price. The success of any hedging transactions we may enter into will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currencies and interest rates. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the effect of the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. Income derived from hedging transactions is generally not eligible to be distributed to non-U.S. stockholders free from U.S. withholding tax. We may be unable or determine not to hedge against particular risks, including if we determine that available hedging transactions are not available at an appropriate price. 
 There are certain risks associated with holding debt obligations that have original issue discount or payment-in-kind interest. 
 Original issue discount OID may arise if we hold securities issued at a discount or in certain other circumstances. OID and payment-in-kind PIK interest create the risk that incentive fees will be paid to the Investment Adviser based on non-cash accruals that ultimately may not be realized, while the Investment Adviser will be under no obligation to reimburse us for these fees. We hold investments that result in OID interest and PIK interest. 
 The higher interest rates of OID instruments reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and OID instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. Even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is supposed to occur at the maturity of the obligation. 
 OID instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. OID income may also create uncertainty about the source of our cash dividends. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 For accounting purposes, any cash dividends to stockholders representing OID income are not treated as coming from paid-in capital, even if the cash to pay them comes from the proceeds of issuances of our common stock. As a result, despite the fact that a dividend representing OID income could be paid out of amounts invested by our stockholders, the Investment Company Act does not require that stockholders be given notice of this fact by reporting it as a return of capital. 
 PIK interest has the effect of generating investment income at a compounding rate, thereby further increasing the incentive fees payable to the Investment Adviser. Similarly, all things being equal, the deferral associated with PIK interest also increases the loan-to-value ratio at a compounding rate. 
 Our investments may be affected by force majeure events. 
 Our investments may be affected by force majeure events (e.g. events beyond the control of the party claiming that the event has occurred, including, without limitation, acts of God, fire, flood, earthquakes, outbreaks of infectious disease, pandemic or any other serious public health concern, war, trade war, cyber security breaches, terrorism and labor strikes). Some force majeure events may adversely affect the ability of a party (including a portfolio company or a counterparty to us or a portfolio company) to perform its obligations until it is able to remedy the force majeure event. In addition, the cost to a portfolio company or us of repairing or replacing damaged assets resulting from such force majeure event could be considerable. Certain force majeure events (such as war or an outbreak of an infectious disease) could have a broader negative impact on the world economy and international business activity generally, or in any of the countries in which we may invest specifically. 
 Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. 
 The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance. 
 Quarterly Tender Offers are not guaranteed and, if implemented for any given quarter, will be for a limited number of our shares of common stock. You may not be able to sell your shares on timely basis. 
 The Company has conducted, and intends to continue to conduct, the Quarterly Tender Offers, but is not obligated to do so. 
 In any given quarter, the Investment Adviser may or may not recommend to the Board that the Company conduct a Quarterly Tender Offer. For example, if adverse market conditions occur, the Company does not have available cash on hand or other available capital resources necessary to conduct a Quarterly Tender Offer, or the Board otherwise believes that conducting a Quarterly Tender Offer would impose an undue burden on the Company and its stockholders then the Board, in its discretion, may determine to not conduct a Quarterly Tender Offer or otherwise alter or suspend the Company s liquidity program. Accordingly, there may be periods during which no Quarterly Tender Offer is made. If during any consecutive 24-month period, the Company does not engage in a Quarterly Tender Offer in which the Company accepts for purchase 100 of properly tendered shares (a Qualifying Tender ), the Company will not make commitments for new portfolio investments (excluding short-term cash management investments under 30 days in duration) and will reserve available assets to satisfy future tender requests until a Qualifying Tender occurs, subject to the Company continuing to use available funds and liquidity for certain purposes. 
 If a Quarterly Tender Offer is not made, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares in the relevant quarter or, if they are able to sell their shares, may be able to sell such shares only at substantial discounts from net asset value. In addition, any Quarterly Tender Offers and the Special Tender Offer will be for a limited number of our shares of common stock. 
 If the Company does conduct Quarterly Tender Offers, it may be required to sell portfolio securities it would otherwise hold to purchase shares that are tendered, which may result in losses and may increase Company expenses as a percentage of net assets. 
 Although the Company is permitted to borrow money to finance the repurchase of shares pursuant to the Quarterly Tender Offers, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such financing at the time of any particular tender offer or that capacity will be available under any financing the Company has arranged to fund such tender offer. 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Because stockholders will be able to participate in one or more Quarterly Tender Offers only up to their pro rata share of the number of shares of common stock tendered if the applicable tender offer is oversubscribed, stockholders may not be able to exit the Company or sell their desired amount of shares through one or more Quarterly Tender Offers. 
 Our common stock is subject to transfer restrictions. 
 Our investors may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of (in each case, a Transfer any common stock unless (i) we give consent and (ii) the Transfer is made in accordance with applicable securities laws. No Transfer will be effectuated except by registration of the Transfer on our books. Each transferee must agree to be bound by these restrictions and all other obligations as an investor in us. 
 There is a risk that our stockholders may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions to you may be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this Form 10-K. If we declare a dividend, we may be forced to sell some of our investments in order to make cash dividend payments. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. The Credit Facilities may also limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions or fail to comply with certain covenants. Further, if we invest a greater amount of assets in equity securities that do not pay current dividends, it could reduce the amount available for distribution. See Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Distributions for additional information. Investing a greater amount of assets in equity securities that do not pay current dividends may also inhibit our ability to make required interest payments to holders of our debt, which may cause a default under the terms of our debt agreements. Such a default could materially increase our cost of raising capital, as well as cause us to incur penalties under the terms of our debt agreements. 
 The distributions we pay to our stockholders in a year may exceed our taxable income for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes that would reduce a stockholder s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock and correspondingly increase such stockholder s gain, or reduce such stockholder s loss, on disposition of such shares. Distributions in excess of a stockholder s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock will constitute capital gains to such stockholder. 
 We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income. 
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in our taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as OID or accruals on a contingent payment debt instrument, which may occur if we receive warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances or contracted PIK interest, which generally represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Any such income would be treated as income earned by us and therefore would be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement (as defined and explained more fully in Item 1. Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC . ). We also may be required to include in our taxable income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash. The credit risk associated with the collectability of deferred payments may be increased as and when a portfolio company increases the amount of interest on which it is deferring cash payment through deferred interest features. Our investments with a deferred interest feature may represent a higher credit risk than loans for which interest must be paid in full in cash on a regular basis. For example, even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is scheduled to occur upon maturity of the obligation. 
 Because in certain cases we may recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty making distributions to our stockholders that will be sufficient to enable us to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary for us to maintain our status as a RIC. Accordingly, we may need to sell some of our assets at times and/or at prices that we would not consider advantageous, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital, or we may need to forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business (or be unable to take actions that are advantageous to our business) to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders that will be sufficient to enable us to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement. However, under the Investment Company Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless an asset coverage test is met. See Item 1. Business Regulation Indebtedness and Senior Securities for additional information. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes). Additionally, we may make investments that result in the recognition of ordinary income rather than capital gain, or that prevent us from accruing a long-term holding period. These investments may prevent us from making capital gain distributions. See Item 1. Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC for additional information. 
 Alternatively, we may, with the consent of all our stockholders, designate an amount as a consent dividend i.e. , a deemed dividend). In that case, although we would not distribute any actual cash to our stockholders, the consent dividend would be treated like an actual dividend under the Code for all U.S. federal income tax purposes. This would allow us to deduct the amount of the consent dividend and our stockholders would be required to include that amount in income as if it were actually distributed. For additional discussion regarding the tax implications of a RIC, see Item 1. Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC . 
 Non-U.S. stockholders may be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends we pay. 
 Distributions of our investment company taxable income to a non-U.S. stockholder that are not effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder s conduct of a trade or business within the United States may be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30 rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty) to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Certain properly designated dividends are generally exempt from withholding of U.S. federal income tax, including certain dividends that are paid in respect of our (i) qualified net interest income (generally, our U.S.-source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which we or the non-U.S. stockholder are at least a 10 shareholder, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) qualified short-term capital gains (generally, the excess of our net short-term capital gain over our long-term capital loss for such taxable year), and certain other requirements were satisfied. No assurance can be given as to whether any of our distributions will be eligible for this exemption from withholding of U.S. federal income tax or, if eligible, will be designated as such by us. See Item 1. Business Election to be Taxed as a RIC . for additional information.

 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 
 Market Information 
 Our outstanding common stock will be offered and sold in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D, as well as under Regulation S under the Securities Act. There is no established public trading market for our common stock currently, nor can we give any assurance that one will develop. 
 Holders 
 As of March 13, 2023, there were approximately 2,888 holders of record of our common stock. 
 Distributions 
 To the extent that we have taxable income available, we intend to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. The amount of our dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors. Any dividends to our stockholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We anticipate that our distributions will generally be paid from taxable earnings, including interest and capital gains generated by our investment portfolio, and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees, that we receive from portfolio companies. However, if we do not generate sufficient taxable earnings during a year, all or part of a distribution may constitute a return of capital. The specific tax characteristics of our dividends and other distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of each calendar year. 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98 of our ordinary income for the calendar year; (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and, (3) any undistributed ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax less certain over-distributions in prior years. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses), if any, at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment, pay U.S. federal income tax on such amounts at regular corporate tax rates, and elect to treat such gains as deemed distributions to stockholders. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, to the extent that we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the Investment Company Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. 
 Dividends and distributions, if any, are paid in cash to our stockholders, and reinvested in additional shares of common stock pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan as described below under Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless a stockholder has opted out of the plan or is otherwise not a participant in the plan. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, if we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the Investment Company Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board of Directors on behalf of our stockholders on shares of our common stock purchased in the New Continuous Offering who do not elect to receive their dividends on such shares in cash. As a result, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution on shares of common stock purchased in the New Continuous Offering, then stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan with respect to such shares will have their cash distributions on such shares purchased in the New Continuous Offering automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 We intend to use newly issued shares of common stock to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding capital commitments. The plan may be terminated by the Company at any time upon notice in writing mailed to each stockholder of record. 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Except as previously reported by the Company on its current reports on Form 8-K, the Company did not sell any securities within the past three years that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In the second quarter of 2022, we commenced a quarterly liquidity program pursuant to which we expect to conduct Quarterly Tender Offers to repurchase up to 3.5 of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately prior to the quarter in which the Quarterly Tender Offer is conducted, at a per share price based on the net asset value per share as of the last day of the quarter in which the Quarterly Tender Offer is conducted. However, the Board of Directors has the discretion to determine whether or not we will purchase common stock from stockholders, and we are not required to conduct tender offers on a quarterly basis or at all. If during any consecutive 24-month period, we do not engage in a Qualifying Tender, we will not make commitments for new portfolio investments (excluding short-term cash management investments under 30 days in duration) and, will reserve available assets to satisfy future tender requests until a Qualifying Tender occurs, subject to our continuing to use available funds and liquidity for certain purposes, as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K Business Corporate Structure. 
 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased in October 2022, upon completion of our tender offer that commenced September 29, 2022, 2,108,344 shares for a purchase price of 19.87 per share, or approximately 41.9 million in aggregate. In August 2022 and December 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the repurchase of 8,547 and 4,162 shares of the Company, respectively, which had been tendered by the investors in the Quarterly Tender Offers. These shares were not repurchased in the Quarterly Tender Offers and instead were repurchased by the Company at the prices per share of 19.80, or 170, and 19.87, or 83, respectively.

 OVERVIEW 
 Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc., a Maryland corporation is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and have operated our business as a BDC since we began our investment activities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We were incorporated in February 2017. We conducted the Initial Private Offering and intend to conduct the New Continuous Offering of our shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have an indefinite term. Our principal executive offices are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017.

 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and current income primarily through assembling a portfolio of senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately 25 million to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), supported by financial sponsors. This core strategy is opportunistically supplemented with differentiated and complementary lending and investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans ), with a minority of our assets invested in investments that are typically higher yielding than Middle Market Senior Loans (which may include unsecured debt, mezzanine debt and investments in equities). 
 We are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Our Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Both our Investment Adviser and our Administrator are wholly owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of Carlyle. The Investment Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The members of the Investment Committee include several of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across multiple asset classes with significant industry experience and tenure. As of December 31, 2022, our Investment Adviser s investment team included a team of more than 230 investment professionals across the Carlyle Global Credit segment. The Investment Committee has delegated approval of certain amendments, follow-on investments with existing borrowers, investments below certain size thresholds (existing or new platforms), and other matters as determined by the Investment Committee to the Screening Committee. In addition, our Investment Adviser and its investment team are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale, relationships and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR or SOFR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement between us and our Investment Adviser; (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement between us and our Administrator; (iii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and (iv) other operating expenses as detailed below: 
 
 administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement and Sub-Administration Agreements, including related expenses; 
 the costs of any other offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any; 
 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser, or members of our Investment Adviser team managing our investments, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, expenses of enforcing our rights; 
 certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares; 
 the allocated costs incurred by our Investment Adviser in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; 
 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; 
 the costs associated with subscriptions to data service, research-related subscriptions and expenses and quotation equipment and services used in making or holding investments; 
 transfer agent and custodial fees; 
 costs of hedging; 
 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 
 federal and state registration fees; 
 any U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including any excise taxes; 
 independent director fees and expenses; 
 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records, costs of preparing tax returns, costs of Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and attestation and costs of filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies), and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation or review of the foregoing; 
 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 
 the costs of specialty and custom software for monitoring risk, compliance and overall portfolio management, including any development costs incurred prior to the filing of our election to be regulated as a BDC; 
 our fidelity bond; 
 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 
 indemnification payments; 
 direct fees and expenses associated with independent audits, agency, consulting and legal costs; and 
 all other expenses incurred by us or our Administrator in connection with administering our business, including our allocable share of certain officers and their staff compensation. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset decline.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, investments consisted of the following: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value First Lien Debt 1,802,253 1,755,773 1,683,550 1,674,715 Second Lien Debt 269,498 260,934 338,076 337,899 Equity Investments 68,033 74,164 49,349 57,469 Total 2,139,784 2,090,871 2,070,975 2,070,083 
 The weighted average yields (1) for our first and second lien debt, based on the amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value First Lien Debt 11.2 11.5 7.7 7.8 Second Lien Debt 12.7 13.1 9.1 9.1 First and Second Lien Debt Total 11.4 11.7 8.0 8.0 
 (1) Weighted average yields include the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at fair value is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at fair value included in such securities. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at amortized cost is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at amortized cost included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above.

 Total weighted average yields (which includes the effect of accretion of discount and amortization of premiums) of our first and second lien debt investments as measured on an amortized cost basis increased from 8.0 to 11.4 from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The increase in weighted average yields was primarily due to rising benchmark interest rates. 
 The following table summarizes the fair value of our performing and non-accrual/non-performing investments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings . Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 5, which ratings are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage. 
 Internal Risk Ratings Definitions 
 Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 
 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost basis is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 
 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 
 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit.

 Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings assigned as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Fair Value of Fair Value Fair Value of Fair Value Internal Risk Rating 1 85.0 4.2 39.6 2.0 Internal Risk Rating 2 1,678.8 83.2 1,671.7 83.1 Internal Risk Rating 3 245.7 12.2 290.5 14.4 Internal Risk Rating 4 7.2 0.4 Internal Risk Rating 5 10.8 0.5 Total 2,016.7 100.0 2,012.6 100.0 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our debt investment portfolio was 2.1 for both periods. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, one of our debt investments, with an aggregate fair value of 7.2 million and 10.8 million, respectively, was assigned an Internal Risk Rating of 4-5. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, one first lien debt investment in the portfolio with a fair value of 7.2 million and 10.8 million was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.3 and 0.5 , respectively, of the total investments at fair value. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 See the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our investments, including a list of companies and type and amount of investments. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 
 The net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons may not be meaningful. 
 Net investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Total investment income 197,695 166,324 141,975 Total expenses (including Excise tax expense) 78,586 63,196 55,584 Net investment income (loss) 119,109 103,128 86,391 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 First Lien Debt 161,937 139,353 113,748 Second Lien Debt 30,135 25,488 26,785 Equity Investments 5,623 1,481 1,378 Cash 2 64 Total investment income 197,695 166,324 141,975 
 The increase in investment income for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the comparable period in 2021 was primarily driven by an increase in interest income from higher weighted average interest rates and a higher average investment balance. As of December 31, 2022, the size of our portfolio increased to 2,139,784 from 2,070,975 as of December 31, 2021,

 at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average yield of our first and second lien debt on amortized cost increased to 11.4 from 8.0 as of December 31, 2021, on amortized cost, primarily due to rising benchmark interest rates on existing investments. 
 The increase in investment income for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the comparable period in 2020 was primarily driven by a higher average investment balance. As of December 31, 2021, the size of our portfolio increased to 2,070,975 from 1,833,385 as of December 31, 2020, at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average yield of our first and second lien debt increased to 8.0 from 7.8 as of December 31, 2020, on amortized cost, primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that were repaid or were sold. 
 Interest income on our first and second lien debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. 
 Expenses 
 Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 comprised the following: 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Management fees 11,770 12,351 11,631 Net investment income incentive fee 17,961 18,198 15,256 Professional fees 3,525 2,038 1,490 Administrative service fees 1,419 892 430 Interest expense and credit facility fees 40,953 27,502 24,941 Directors fees and expenses 351 335 239 Other general and administrative 2,527 1,880 1,597 Excise tax expense 80 100 Total expenses 78,586 63,296 55,584

 For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense 38,136 25,837 22,425 Facility unused commitment fee 1,105 270 992 Amortization of deferred financing costs 1,712 1,395 1,524 Total interest expense and credit facility fees 40,953 27,502 24,941 Cash paid for interest expense and credit facility fees 31,433 24,642 21,675 Average principal debt outstanding 923,838 961,892 726,109 Weighted average interest rate 4.07 2.65 3.04 
 The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the comparable period in 2021 was driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the comparable period in 2020 was driven by increased draws under the Credit Facilities related to increased deployment of capital for investments, offset by lower borrowing costs.

 Below is a summary of the base management fees and incentive fees incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Base management fees 11,770 12,351 11,631 Incentive fees on pre-incentive fee net investment income 17,961 18,198 15,256 Realized capital gains incentive fees Accrued capital gains incentive fees Total capital gains incentive fees Total incentive fees 17,961 18,198 15,256 Total base management fees and incentive fees 29,731 30,549 26,887 
 The decrease in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the comparable period in 2021 was driven by a reduction in our management fee from 1.25 to 1.0 that was effective on September 12, 2021. The decrease in incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the comparable period in 2021 was driven by a reduction in our incentive fee rate in connection with the January 12, 2022 amendment and restatement of the Investment Advisory Agreement, partially offset by higher pre-incentive fee net investment income. The increase in management fees and incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the comparable period in 2020 was driven by our increased deployment of capital and increased net investment income. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recorded no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon our cumulative net realized gain (loss) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the incentive and management fees. 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the comparable period in 2021 was primarily driven by higher legal fees due to the Company's conversion to a perpetual life BDC and ongoing activities associated therewith. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions, sub-administrative fees and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had realized gains on 8 investments totaling 5,578, offset by realized losses on 5 investments totaling 5,921. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had realized gains on 15 investments totaling 10,949, offset by realized losses on 1 investment totaling 127. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had realized gains on 2 investments totaling 22, offset by realized losses on 6 investments totaling 5,175. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had a change in unrealized appreciation on 35, 91, and 64 investments, respectively, totaling 20,381, 42,839, and 24,270, respectively, which were offset by a change in unrealized depreciation on 134, 58, and 60 investments, respectively, totaling 68,402, 21,881, and 47,837, respectively. 
 Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net realized gain (loss) on investments (343) 10,822 (5,153) Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (48,021) 20,958 (23,512) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (48,364) 31,780 (28,665)

 Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments by the types of investments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

 Net change in unrealized depreciation in our investments for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by wider market yields, compared to a net change in unrealized appreciation in our investments for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily driven by improving credit fundamentals and tightening market yields. Net change in unrealized depreciation in our investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by unrealized depreciation related to investments more heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with higher market yields. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as well as through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders, the repurchase of our shares through the Quarterly Tender Offer, and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our revolving credit facilities and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies. 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 We entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on October 3, 2017, as amended from time to time (the Subscription Facility ). The Subscription Facility was terminated and repaid in full on October 3, 2022. The Company was able to borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the Subscription Facility accrued interest at LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 1.95 per year, subject to a 0.50 floor on LIBOR. The Company was also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25 per year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Subscription Facility was secured by a first lien security interest in our equity investors unfunded capital commitments. 
 We entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on April 1, 2019 (the SPV Credit Facility ), as amended from time to time. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum principal amount of the SPV Credit Facility was 700,000, and is subject to availability under the SPV Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 1, 2026, with one one-year extension option, subject to the SPV s and the lender s consent. The SPV may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest initially at SOFR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate) plus 2.50 per year. The SPV also pays a fee of between 0.50 and 0.75 per year on undrawn amounts under the SPV Credit Facility. Payments under the SPV Credit Facility are made quarterly. The SPV Credit Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all of the assets of the SPV. 
 We entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on May 13, 2020 (the SPV2 Credit Facility, together with the Subscription Facility and SPV Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities ), as amended from time to time. The SPV2 Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to a principal amount of 550,000, subject to availability under the SPV2 Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV2 Credit Facility has a revolving period through March 7, 2025 and a maturity date of March 7, 2030. Borrowings under the SPV2 Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate plus 0.50 plus 2.40 per year. SPV2 is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25 per

 year. Payments under the SPV2 Credit Facility are made quarterly. The lenders have a security interest on substantially all of the assets of SPV2. 
 Although we believe that we, the SPV and SPV2 will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we, the SPV and SPV2 will continue to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities, as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Subscription Facility, the SPV Credit Facility and/or the SPV2 Credit Facility that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the respective facility, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, to the extent that we cannot meet our financing obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market conditions or otherwise, which may result in losses. 
 For more information on the Credit Facilities, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 73,760 and 65,838, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The Credit Facilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, as well as with our Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. Effective September 8, 2022, the Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, determines in good faith the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available. The Investment Adviser values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Investment Adviser may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e., consensus pricing ). When doing so, the Investment Adviser determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Investment Adviser may use the quote obtained, or alternative pricing sources may be utilized, including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments. 
 Securities/instruments that are illiquid, or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology, or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded investment other than Credit Fund is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management s preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) if applicable, prior to September 8, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee reviewed the assessments of the Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm; and (v) if applicable, prior to September 8, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determined the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm. 
 All factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the following factors, as relevant: 
 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; 
 call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt; 
 the portfolio company s leverage and ability to make payments; 
 the portfolio company s public or private credit rating; 
 the portfolio company s actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow; 
 prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates; 
 the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and

 comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities. 
 Investment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificate received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which, in many cases, may reflect a lag in information. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value. 
 For further information on the fair value hierarchies, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on fair value measurements. 
 Investments 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Non-Accrual Income 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are current or there is no longer any reasonable doubt that such principal or interest will be collected in full and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine not to place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 Income Taxes 
 For federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, the Company must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then the Company is generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute. 
 
 The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require the Company to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its investment company taxable income ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.

 In addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. 
 The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely than not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense. 
 The SPV and SPV2 are disregarded entities for tax purposes and are consolidated with the tax return of the Company. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments may not have a readily available market price. Our Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, values our investments for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith at fair value in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of December 31, 2022, on a fair value basis, approximately 2.3 of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 97.7 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors. Interest rates on the investments held within our portfolio of investments are typically based on floating LIBOR or SOFR, with many of these investments also having a reference rate floor. Additionally, our Credit Facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are typically paid based on floating LIBOR or SOFR rates. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our settled portfolio of debt investments held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the settled debt investments in our portfolio held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and based on the terms of our Credit Facilities. Interest expense on our Credit Facilities is calculated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may impact significantly our net interest income. 
 
 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled debt investments

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. (the Company ), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, by correspondence with the custodian, debt agents, and the underlying investees; when replies were not received from the debt agents and the underlying investees, we performed other auditing procedures. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.

 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 
 
 1. ORGANIZATION 
 Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. CARS or the Company is a Maryland corporation formed on February 10, 2017 and structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. The Company is managed by its investment adviser, Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C., CGCIM or Investment Adviser ), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Carlyle Group Inc. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act ). In addition, the Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Code ). 
 
 The Company s investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and current income primarily through assembling a portfolio of senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. The Company's core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies, which the Company defines as companies with approximately 25 million to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA supported by financial sponsors. T he Company invests primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans ), with a minority of its assets invested in higher yielding investments (which may include unsecured debt, subordinated debt and investments in equities). The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms. 
 The Company invests primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt has been rated below investment grade, or would likely be rated below investment grade if it was rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 On September 11, 2017 ("Commencement"), the Company completed its initial closing of capital commitments (the Initial Closing and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations. On January 21, 2022, stockholders approved the Company's conversion from a finite life private BDC with no interim liquidity to a private BDC with a perpetual life and a regular quarterly liquidity program.

 The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. 
 The Company is externally managed by the Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Carlyle Global Credit Administration L.L.C., CGCA or the Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for the Company to operate.

 As a BDC, the Company is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As part of these requirements, the Company must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the Investment Company Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of its total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). 
 To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders generally at least 90 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year.

 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The Company is an investment company for the purposes of accounting and financial reporting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, the SPVs. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. U.S. GAAP for an investment company requires investments to be recorded at fair value. The carrying value for all other assets and liabilities approximates their fair value. 
 The annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for annual financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Article 6 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of consolidated financial statements for the year and period presented have been included. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management s estimates are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Company s accounting policies. Assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of investments and their resulting impact on management and incentive fees involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and these assumptions and estimates may be significant to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material. 
 Investments 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments (e.g., money market funds, U.S. treasury notes) with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held with two large financial institutions and cash held in such financial institutions may, at times, exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had restricted cash balances of 51,725 and 31,553, respectively, which represent amounts that are collected by trustees who have been appointed as custodians of the assets securing certain of the Company s financing transactions, and held for payment of interest expense and principal on the outstanding borrowings, or

 reinvestment into new assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 2,399 and 269, respectively, of the restricted cash balances were denominated in a foreign currency. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest from Investments and Realized Gain/Loss on Investments 
 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt investments represents the original cost, including origination fees and upfront fees received that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. At time of exit, the realized gain or loss on an investment is the difference between the amortized cost at time of exit and the cash received at exit using the specific identification method. 
 The Company may have loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the loans in the portfolio with PIK provisions was 206,773 and 197,006, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company earned 10,937, 6,818 and 4,110 in PIK income, which is included in interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2022, the Company began presenting PIK income as a separate financial statement line item in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, which had previously been included in interest income. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation. 
 Other Income 
 Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, unused, underwriting, arranger and prepayment fees associated with the Company s investment activities, as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. The Company may receive fees for guaranteeing the outstanding debt of a portfolio company. Such fees are amortized into other income over the life of the guarantee. The unamortized amount, if any, is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company earned 6,994, 6,021 and 10,047, respectively, in other income, primarily from prepayment, amendment and underwriting fees. 
 Non-Accrual Income 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are current or there is no longer any reasonable doubt that such principal or interest will be collected in full and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine not to place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the loan in the portfolio on non-accrual status was 7,176 and 10,836, respectively. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Credit Facilities Related Costs, Expenses and Deferred Financing Costs 
 The Company, the SPV and SPV2 have each entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the Subscription Facility, which was terminated October 3, 2022, SPV Credit Facility and SPV2 Credit Facility, respectively, and together, the Credit Facilities ). Interest expense and unused commitment fees on the Credit Facilities are recorded on an accrual basis. Unused commitment fees are included in interest expense and credit facility fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Deferred financing costs include capitalized expenses related to the closing or amendments of the Credit Facilities. Amortization of deferred financing costs for each credit facility is computed on the straight-line basis over the respective term of each credit facility. The unamortized balance of such costs is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The amortization of such costs is included in interest expense and credit facility fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Table of Contents 

 In 2021, the Company separately presented deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and credit facility fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2022, these amounts are presented as a component of prepaid expenses and other assets and interest expense and credit facility fees on their respective statements. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation. 
 Income Taxes 
 For federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, the Company must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then the Company is generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute. 
 The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require the Company to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its investment company taxable income ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI. 
 In addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company incurred excise tax of 80 and 100, respectively. The Company did not incur excise tax for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely than not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense. The SPVs are disregarded entities for tax purposes and are consolidated with the tax return of the Company. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense. 
 Dividends and Distributions to Common Stockholders 
 To the extent that the Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its common stockholders. Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be distributed is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 Dividends and distributions, if any, are paid in cash to common stockholders, and may then be reinvested in shares of common stock at the election of the common stockholder pursuant to the Company s dividend reinvestment plan. 
 Functional Currency 
 The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. Investments are generally made in the local currency of the country in which the investment is domiciled and are translated into U.S. Dollars with foreign currency translation gains or losses recorded within net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the accompanying consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency translation gains and losses on non-investment assets and liabilities are separately reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Earnings Per Common Share 
 The Company computes earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share ASC 260 ). Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 
 99 

Table of Contents 

 attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. 
 Recent Accounting Standards Updates 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which expanded the scope of Topic 848 to include derivative instruments impacted by discounting transition. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging transactions as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-04, 2021-01, and 2022-06 on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect this guidance to impact its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
 The Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. Effective September 8, 2022, the Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, determines in good faith the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available. The Investment Adviser values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Investment Adviser may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e., consensus pricing ). When doing so, the Investment Adviser determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Investment Adviser may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments. 
 Securities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Company s Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of the Investment Adviser; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded investment is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management s preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) if applicable, prior to September 8, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee reviewed the assessments of the Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm; and (v) if applicable, prior to September 8, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determined the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm. 
 All factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the following factors, as relevant: 
 
 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; 
 call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt; 
 the portfolio company s leverage and ability to make payments; 
 100 

Table of Contents 

 the portfolio company s public or private credit rating; 
 the portfolio company s actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow; 
 prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates; 
 the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and 
 comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities. 
 Investment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value. 
 Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in determination of fair values, as follows: 
 
 Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. Financial instruments in this category generally include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 
 Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date and are those other than quoted prices in active markets. Financial instruments in this category generally include less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. 
 Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments in this category generally include investments in privately-held entities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Investment Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 
 Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the year in which the transfers occur. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no transfers between levels.

 The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments that are categorized as Level 3: 
 Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Investment Adviser carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company. 
 Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis. 
 Investments in debt securities with sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s contractual interest, fees and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the security s expected maturity date. The discount rate to be used is determined using an average of two market-based methodologies. Investments in debt securities may also be valued using consensus pricing. 
 103 

Table of Contents 

 Investments in equities are generally valued using a market approach and/or an income approach. The market approach utilizes EBITDA multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company. 
 The following tables summarize the quantitative information related to the significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 instruments which are carried at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in first and second lien debt securities are discount rates, indicative quotes and comparable EBITDA multiples. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in indicative quotes or comparable EBITDA multiples in isolation may result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in equities are discount rates and comparable EBITDA multiples. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in comparable EBITDA multiples would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. 
 Financial instruments disclosed but not carried at fair value 
 The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of the Company s secured borrowings disclosed but not carried at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 On June 26, 2017, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser. The initial term of the Investment Advisory Agreement was two years from June 26, 2017 and, unless terminated earlier, the Investment Advisory Agreement will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board of Directors and by the vote of a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (the Independent Directors ). On October 11, 2021, the Board, including all of its Independent Directors, reviewed and approved the terms of an amended and restated investment advisory agreement for an initial term of two years, conditional upon stockholders approval of the proposal to convert the Company to a perpetual life BDC as discussed above. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was amended and restated effective as of January 21, 2022 as discussed below, and subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of two components a management fee and an incentive fee. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the management fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.00 of the Company s average Capital Under Management (as defined below) at the end of the then-current quarter and the prior calendar quarter (and, in the case of the Company s first quarter, the Company s Capital Under Management as of such quarter-end). Capital Under Management means cumulative capital called, less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital. Returned Capital means unused capital commitments increased by the aggregate amount of (i) any portion of distributions made by the Company to an investor during the Original Investment Period (as defined below) which represents (A) proceeds realized from the sale or repayment of any investment (as opposed to investment income) during the Investment Period (but not in excess of the cost of any such investment) or (B) a return of such investor s capital contributions to the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors, and (ii) any amount drawn down by the Company from unused capital commitments to pay management fees, incentive fees, organizational expenses or Company expenses, to the extent such investor receives subsequent distributions. The Original Investment Period commenced on September 11, 2017 and was scheduled to expire September 11, 2021. On January 11, 2021, the Board of Directors extended the Investment Period for one additional one-year period through September 11, 2022. On January 11, 2021, the Company, in connection with the extension of the Investment Period to September 11, 2022, entered into a letter agreement with the Investment Adviser, under which the Investment Adviser agreed that effective September 12, 2021 the annual rate of its management fee would decrease from a rate of 1.25 to 1.00 of the Company's average Capital Under Management. For the avoidance of doubt, Capital Under Management does not include capital acquired through the use of leverage, and Returned Capital does not include distributions of the Company s investment income (i.e., proceeds received in respect of interest payments, dividends or fees, net of expenses) or net realized capital gains to the investors. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee consisted of two parts. The first part was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equaled 15 of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a preferred return of 1.75 per quarter (7 annualized), or hurdle rate, and a catch-up feature. The second part was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to 15 of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that no incentive fee on capital gains is payable to the Investment Adviser unless cumulative total return exceeded a 7 annual return on weighted average cumulative capital called less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital. 
 On January 21, 2022, stockholders approved the amended and restated investment advisory agreement, which the Company entered into effective as of the date of such approval (the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement ). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, (i) the income-based incentive fee rate was reduced from 15.0 to 12.5 , and the "hurdle rate" was reduced from 1.75 (7.0 annualized) to 1.25 (5.0 annualized); (ii) the capital gains incentive fee was reduced from 15.0 to 12.5 ; and (iii) the calculation of the annual base management fee was

Table of Contents 

 changed to 1.00 of the Company's net asset value as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (as adjusted for capital called, dividends reinvested, distributions paid and issuer share repurchases made during the current calendar quarter) from 1.00 of the Company's average capital under management. The terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement were effective upon execution of the agreement, except for the change to the income-based incentive fee which became effective for the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2022.

 (2) Dividends declared per share was calculated as the sum of dividends declared during the year divided by the number of shares outstanding at the quarter-end date (refer to Note 7, Net Assets, to these consolidated financial statements). 
 (3) Increase (decrease) is due to the offering price of subscriptions during the year (refer to Note 7, Net Assets, to these consolidated financial statements).

 10. TAX 
 The Company has not recorded a liability for any uncertain tax positions pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has filed a tax return and therefore is subject to examination. The Company has elected a tax year-end of June 30 concurrent with the filing of the Company s first tax return. 
 Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified among the Company s capital accounts. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from U.S. GAAP. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, permanent differences primarily due to non-deductible excise tax paid and non-deductible expenses from investments in partnerships resulted in a net decrease in total distributable loss by 304 and 103, respectively, and a net decrease in additional paid-in capital in excess of par by 304 and 103, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Total earnings and NAV were not affected. 
 The Company s taxable income for each period is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return for each year. Therefore, the final taxable income, and the taxable income earned in each period and carried forward for distribution in the following period, may be different than this estimate. The estimated tax character of dividends declared for the periods from July 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 was as follows: 
 For the Period from July, 1 2022 to December 31, 2022 For the Period from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 Ordinary income 56,941 109,636 Long-term capital gains 3,125 5,914 Tax return of capital 
 Income Tax Information and Distributions to Stockholders 
 As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the components of accumulated earnings (deficit) on a tax basis were as follows: 
 As of June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Undistributed ordinary income 26,240 25,096 Other book/tax temporary differences (1) 
 (27,627) (25,005) Capital loss carryforwards (3,233) Undistributed capital gains 5,592 Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (2) 
 (46,604) 1,989 Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on non-investment assets and liabilities 9,531 (4,424) Total accumulated earnings (deficit) (32,868) (5,577) 
 
 (1) Consists of dividends payable as well as the unamortized portion of organization costs as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. 
 (2) The difference between the book-basis and tax-basis unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is attributable to the tax treatment of partnership investments.

 As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes and gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments were as follows: 
 As of June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Cost of investments 2,033,294 1,921,824 Gross unrealized appreciation on investments 13,976 34,140 Gross unrealized depreciation on investments (60,580) (32,151) Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (46,604) 1,989 
 For tax purposes, net realized capital losses may be carried over to offset future capital gains, if any. Funds are permitted to carry forward capital losses for an indefinite period, and such losses will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had no capital loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had 3,233, of capital loss carryforwards, of which 2,347 were short-term capital loss carryforwards and 886 were long-term capital loss carryforwards.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was effective. 
 This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm due to an exemption for emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.2 
 DESCRIPTION OF REGISTERED SECURITIES 
 Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Exhibit is attached. 
 
 The following description of Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. s common stock is based on the relevant provisions of the MGCL, the Investment Company Act, Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. s Articles of Amendment and Restatement (as amended and restated from time to time, the charter and Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. s Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended and restated from time to time, the bylaws ). This summary describes the provisions deemed to be material, but is not necessarily complete, and you should refer to the MGCL, the Investment Company Act and Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. s charter and bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Carlyle Credit Solutions, Inc. (the Company, we, us or our had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act our common stock, par value 0.01 per share. 
 Capital Stock 
 Our authorized stock consists of 200,000,000 shares, par value 0.01 per share, all of which are currently designated as common stock. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase our stock. No stock has been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under Maryland law, our stockholders generally are not personally liable for our debts or obligations. Under our charter, our Board of Directors (the Board is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock without obtaining stockholder approval. As permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that the Board, without any action by our stockholders, may amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. 
 Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share 
 All shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, voting, and dividends and, when they are issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Distributions may be paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when authorized by our Board and declared by us out of assets legally available therefor. Shares of our common stock are not subject to any sinking fund and have no preemptive, conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract. 
 In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any preferred stock is outstanding at such time. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of our common stock will possess exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of our directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares will be unable to elect any director. 
 As of December 31, 2022 , we had issued and outstanding 58,396,516 shares of common stock. 
 Preferred Stock 
 Our charter authorizes our Board to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, including preferred stock. Prior to the issuance of shares of each class or series, the Board is required by Maryland law and by our charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, 
 -1- 

limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Thus, the Board could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. The cost of any such reclassification would be borne by our existing common stockholders. 
 However, any issuance of preferred stock must comply with the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Certain matters under the Investment Company Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock. For example, holders of preferred stock would vote separately from the holders of common stock on a proposal to cease operations as a BDC. In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote separately from holders of common stock to elect two preferred stock directors. We believe that the availability for issuance of preferred stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring future financings and acquisitions. However, we do not currently have any plans to issue preferred stock. 
 Limitation on Liability of Directors and Officers Indemnification and Advance of Expenses 
 Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates directors and officers liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. 
 Our charter authorizes us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, to indemnify any present or former director or officer of the corporation or any individual who, while serving as our director or officer and at our request, serves or has served another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner or trustee, from and against any claim or liability to which that person may become subject or which that person may incur by reason of his or her service in any such capacity and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding. Our bylaws obligate us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, to indemnify any present or former director or officer or any individual who, while serving as our director or officer and at our request, serves or has served another corporation, real estate investment trust, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member or manager and who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity from and against any claim or liability to which that person may become subject or which that person may incur by reason of his or her service in any such capacity and to pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding without requiring a preliminary determination of his or her ultimate entitlement to indemnification. The charter and bylaws also permit us to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of us in any of the capacities described above and any of our employees or agents or any employees or agents of our predecessor. In accordance with the Investment Company Act, we will not indemnify any person for any liability to which such person would be subject by reason of such person s willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office. 
 Maryland law requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. Maryland law permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was 
 -2- 

unlawful. However, under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received unless, in either case a court orders indemnification, and then only for expenses. In addition, Maryland law permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer in advance of final disposition of a proceeding upon the corporation s receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (b) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met. 
 We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that will provide the maximum indemnification permitted under Maryland law and the Investment Company Act. 
 Certain Provisions of the MGCL and Our Charter and Bylaws 
 The MGCL and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our Board. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms. 
 Classified Board of Directors 
 Our Board is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms with their respective terms expiring at successive annual meetings of stockholders, and in each case, the directors will serve until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Each year, one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders. A staggered board may render a change in control of us or removal of our incumbent management more difficult. We believe, however, that the longer time required to elect a majority of our Board will help to ensure the continuity and stability of our management and policies. 
 Election of Directors 
 As permitted by our charter, our bylaws provide that a plurality of votes in the election of directors cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present will be required to elect a director. Pursuant to our charter and bylaws, our Board may amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect directors. 
 Number of Directors Vacancies Removal 
 Our charter provides that the number of directors will be increased or decreased only by the Board in accordance with our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire Board may at any time increase or decrease the number of directors. However, the number of directors may never be less than one nor more than twelve unless our bylaws are amended in which case we may have more than twelve directors but never less than one. Our charter provides that, at such time as we have at least three independent directors and our common stock is registered under the Exchange Act, we elect to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL regarding the filling of vacancies on the Board. Accordingly, at such time, except as may be provided by the Board in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, any and all vacancies on the Board may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies, subject to any applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act. 
 Our charter provides that a director may be removed only for cause, as defined in our charter, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

Action by Stockholders 
 Under the MGCL, stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or (unless the charter permits stockholder action by less than unanimous written consent, which our charter does not but refers to our bylaws) by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting. Without the provision in our bylaws described below, and combined with the requirements of our bylaws regarding the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders discussed below, these provisions may have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the next annual meeting. Our bylaws currently provide that any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken by the holders of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors without a meeting, if the action is advised, and submitted to the stockholders for approval, by our Board and a consent to such action is given in writing or by electronic transmission of the stockholders entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a stockholders meeting. 
 Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations and Stockholder Proposals 
 Our bylaws provide that with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the Board or (2) by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice, as provided by the bylaws, and at the time of the annual meeting and who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of our bylaws. With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board at a special meeting may be made only (1) by the Board or (2) provided that the Board has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice, as provided by the bylaws, and at the time of the special meeting and who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws. 
 The purpose of requiring stockholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our Board a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by our Board, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of stockholders. Although our bylaws do not give our Board any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals recommending certain action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our stockholders. 
 Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders 
 Our bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called by a majority of our Board, the chairman of the Board and certain of our officers. Additionally, our bylaws provide that, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and informational requirements by the stockholders requesting the meeting, a special meeting of stockholders will be called by the secretary of the corporation upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. 
 Approval of Extraordinary Corporate Action Amendment of Charter and Bylaws 
 Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange, co-invest or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business, unless advised by its board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a 
 -4- 

majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter generally provides for approval of charter amendments and extraordinary transactions by the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter also provides that the following matters require the approval of stockholders entitled to cast at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast (i) certain charter amendments (ii) any proposal for our conversion, whether by merger or otherwise, from a closed-end company to an open-end company (iii) any proposal for our liquidation or dissolution or (iv) any proposal regarding a merger, consolidation, share exchange or sale or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets that the MGCL requires to be approved by our stockholders. However, if such amendment or proposal is approved by a majority of our continuing directors (in addition to approval by our Board), such amendment or proposal may be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on such a matter. The continuing directors are defined in our charter as (1) our current directors, (2) those directors whose nomination for election by the stockholders or whose election by the directors to fill vacancies is approved by a majority of our current directors then on the Board or (3) any successor directors whose nomination for election by the stockholders or whose election by the directors to fill vacancies is approved by a majority of continuing directors or the successor continuing directors then in office. 
 Our charter and bylaws provide that the Board will have the exclusive power to make, alter, amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws. 
 No Appraisal Rights 
 Except with respect to appraisal rights arising in connection with the Control Share Act discussed below, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that stockholders will not be entitled to exercise appraisal rights unless a majority of the Board shall determine such rights apply. 
 Control Share Acquisitions 
 The MGCL, pursuant to the Control Share Act, provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power 
 one-tenth or more but less than one-third 
 
 one-third or more but less than a majority or 
 
 a majority or more of all voting power. 
 
 The requisite stockholder approval must be obtained each time an acquiror crosses one of the thresholds of voting power set forth above. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition may compel the Board of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. The right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 -5- 

If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then the corporation may redeem for fair value any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights have previously been approved. The right of the corporation to redeem control shares is subject to certain conditions and limitations, including, as provided in our bylaws, compliance with the Investment Company Act. Fair value is determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of the shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition. 
 The Control Share Act does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Act any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. However, we will amend our bylaws to be subject to the Control Share Act only if the Board determines that it would be in our best interests and if the SEC staff does not object to our determination that our being subject to the Control Share Act does not conflict with the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued informal guidance setting forth its position that certain provisions of the Control Share Act would, if implemented, violate Section 18(i) of the Investment Company Act. 
 Business Combinations 
 Under Maryland law, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as 
 any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding voting stock or 
 
 an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
 A person is not an interested stockholder under this statute if the Board approved in advance the transaction by which the stockholder otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board. 
 After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the Board of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 
 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and 
 
 two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. 
 These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. 
 -6- 

The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the Board before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Our Board has adopted a resolution that any business combination between us and any other person is exempted from the provisions of the MBCA, provided that the business combination is first approved by the Board, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act). This resolution may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time however, our Board will adopt resolutions so as to make us subject to the provisions of the MBCA only if the Board determines that it would be in our best interests and if the SEC staff does not object to our determination that our being subject to the MBCA does not conflict with the Investment Company Act. If this resolution is repealed, or the Board does not otherwise approve a business combination, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. 
 Conflict with Investment Company Act 
 Our bylaws provide that, if and to the extent that any provision of the MGCL, including the Control Share Act (if we amend our bylaws to be subject to such Act) and the MBCA, or any provision of our charter or bylaws conflicts with any provision of the Investment Company Act, the applicable provision of the Investment Company Act will control. 
 Exclusive Forum 
 Our charter and bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL, the charter or bylaws or the securities, antifraud, unfair trade practices or similar laws of any international, national, state, provincial, territorial, local or other governmental or regulatory authority, including, in each case, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a federal or state court located in the state of Delaware, provided that to the extent the appropriate court located in the state of Delaware determines that it does not have jurisdiction over such action, then the sole and exclusive forum shall be any federal or state court located in the state of Maryland. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to have notice of and consented to these exclusive forum provisions and to have irrevocably submitted to, and waived any objection to, the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in connection with any such action or proceeding and consented to process being served in any such action or proceeding, without limitation, by United States mail addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid.
