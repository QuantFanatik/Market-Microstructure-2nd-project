 The following five paragraphs are disclosures received from U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank N.A. ), which serves as the indenture trustee
 under the indenture for the BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2019-A transaction.

 U.S. Bank N.A. and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential
 mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank N.A. and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the
 sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan
 sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following
 alleged events of default.

U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not
 the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank N.A. cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or
 the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.

On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans
 (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank N.A. in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with
 respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as
 amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have 

been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the
 Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank N.A. concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT
 Action.

U.S. Bank N.A. has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules
 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending
 resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans,
 which remains pending.

U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in
 good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF COHNREZNICK LLP, RELATING TO BMW FS.

EXHIBIT 34.1

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Management Committee

 BMW Financial Services NA, LLC

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that BMW Financial Services NA, LLC (the
 "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for Asset-Backed Securities for BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2019-A, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii),
 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x)(A)-(C), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to
 the asset-backed securities transactions being serviced as of December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with the attestation
 standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis
 of the servicing activities related to BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2019-A, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as
 we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities
 related to each asset-backed transaction included in BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2019-A. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have
 affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
 the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria specified in the first paragraph.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement.

In our opinion, management's assertion that BMW Financial Services NA, LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022 and for the period from
 January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

 U.S. Bank National Association

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National
 Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust
 Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria Items
 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the
 Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
 circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
 whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
 the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
 the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB,
 there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
 reasonable basis for our opinion.

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our
 examination engagement

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S.
 Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
