 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 GENERAL 
 Lamar Advertising Company is one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in the United States based on number of displays and has operated under the Lamar name since 1902. We operate in a single operating and reporting segment, advertising. We rent space for advertising on billboards, buses, shelters, benches, logo plates and in airport terminals. We offer our customers a fully integrated service, satisfying all aspects of their display requirements from ad copy production to placement and maintenance. 
 We operate three types of outdoor advertising displays: billboards, logo signs and transit advertising displays. 
 Billboards. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated approximately 160,200 billboard advertising displays in 45 states and Canada. We rent most of our advertising space on two types of billboards: bulletins and posters. 
 Bulletins are generally large, illuminated advertising structures that are located on major highways and target vehicular traffic. 
 Posters are generally smaller advertising structures that are located on major traffic arteries and city streets and target vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
 In addition to traditional billboards, we also rent space on digital billboards, which are generally located on major traffic arteries and city streets. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated approximately 4,500 digital billboard advertising displays in 43 states and Canada. 
 Logo signs. We rent advertising space on logo signs located near highway exits. 
 Logo signs generally advertise nearby gas, food, camping, lodging and other attractions. 
 We are the largest provider of logo signs in the United States, operating 23 of the 26 privatized state logo sign contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 139,000 logo sign advertising displays in 23 states and the province of Ontario, Canada. 
 Transit advertising displays. We also rent advertising space on the exterior and interior of public transportation vehicles, in airport terminals, and on transit shelters and benches in over 80 markets. As of December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 47,500 transit advertising displays in 24 states and Canada. 
 
 CORPORATE HISTORY 
 We have operated under the Lamar name since our founding in 1902 and have been publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol LAMR since 1996. 
 During 2014, we completed a reorganization in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a REIT for federal income tax purposes. During 2022, the Company completed a tax reorganization to a specific type of REIT known as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust ("UPREIT"). The UPREIT structure allows property owners of appreciated properties to contribute property to the operating partnership of the REIT, on a tax-deferred basis, in exchange for a partnership interest in the form of operating partnership units. 
 In this Annual Report, unless the context otherwise requires, we refer to Lamar Advertising Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (and its predecessor and its consolidated subsidiaries), as applicable, as the Company , Lamar Advertising or we , and we refer to Lamar Advertising s wholly owned subsidiary Lamar Media Corp. as Lamar Media.

 OPERATING STRATEGIES 
 We strive to be a leading provider of outdoor advertising services in each of the markets that we serve, and our operating strategies for achieving that goal include: 
 Continuing to provide high quality local sales and service. We seek to identify and closely monitor the needs of our tenants and to provide them with a full complement of high quality advertising services. Local advertising constituted approximately 78 of our outdoor net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, which management believes is higher than the industry average. We believe that the experience of our regional, territory and local managers has contributed greatly to our success. For example, our regional managers have been with us for an average of 31 years. In an effort to provide high quality sales and service at the local level, we employed approximately 950 local account executives as of December 31, 2022. Local account executives are typically supported by additional local staff and have the ability to draw upon the resources of our central office, as well as our offices in other markets, in the event business opportunities or customers needs support such an allocation of resources. 
 Continuing a centralized control and decentralized management structure. Our management believes that, for our particular business, centralized control and a decentralized organization provide for greater economies of scale and are more responsive to local market demands. Therefore, we maintain centralized accounting and financial control over our local operations, but our local managers are responsible for the day-to-day operations in each local market and are compensated according to that market s financial performance. 
 Continuing to focus on internal growth. Within our existing markets we seek to increase our revenue and improve cash flow by employing highly-targeted local marketing efforts to improve our display occupancy rates and by increasing advertising rates where and when demand can absorb rate increases. Our local offices spearhead this effort and respond to local customer demands quickly. 
 In addition, we routinely invest in upgrading our existing displays and constructing new displays. Since January 1, 2013, we have invested approximately 1.2 billion in capitalized expenditures, which include improvements to our existing real estate portfolio, improvements to recently acquired locations and the construction of new locations. Our regular improvement and expansion of our advertising display inventory allows us to provide high quality service to our current tenants and to attract new tenants. 
 Continuing to pursue other outdoor advertising opportunities. We plan to renew existing logo sign contracts and pursue additional logo sign contracts. Logo sign opportunities arise periodically, both from states initiating new logo sign programs and states converting from government-owned and operated programs to privately-owned and operated programs. Furthermore, we plan to pursue additional tourist oriented directional sign programs in both the United States and Canada and also other motorist information signing programs as opportunities present themselves. In addition, in an effort to maintain market share, we continue to pursue attractive transit and airport advertising opportunities as they become available. 
 Reinvesting in capital expenditures including digital technology. We have a history of investing in capital expenditures, particularly in our digital platform. We spent approximately 167.1 million in total capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022, of which approximately 81.1 million was spent on digital technology. We expect our 2023 capitalized expenditures to be approximately 185 million. 
 
 CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY 
 The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital. To maintain our REIT status, we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. During 2022, we generated 781.6 million of cash from operating activities, which was used to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends to our stockholders. 
 Capital expenditures program. We will continue to reinvest in our existing assets and expand our outdoor advertising display portfolio through new construction. This includes growth and maintenance capital expenditures associated with the construction of new and existing billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, technology-related investments and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. 
 Acquisitions. We will seek to pursue strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising businesses and assets. This includes acquisitions in our existing markets and in new markets where we can meet our return on investment

 criteria. When evaluating investments in new markets, our return on investment criteria reflects the additional risks inherent to the particular geographic area. 
 
 COMPANY OPERATIONS 
 Billboard Advertising 
 We rent most of our advertising space on two types of billboard advertising displays: bulletins and posters. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated approximately 160,200 billboard advertising displays in 45 states and Canada. In 2022, we derived approximately 76 of our billboard advertising net revenues from bulletin rentals and 24 from poster rentals. 
 Bulletins are large, advertising structures (the most common size is 14 feet high by 48 feet wide, or 672 square feet) consisting of panels on which advertising copy is displayed. We wrap advertising copy printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl around the structure. To attract more attention, some of the panels may extend beyond the linear edges of the display face and may include three-dimensional embellishments. Because of their greater impact and higher cost, bulletins are usually located on major highways and target vehicular traffic. At December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 78,600 bulletin displays. 
 We generally rent individually-selected bulletin space to advertisers for the duration of the contract (ranging from 4 to 52 weeks). We also rent bulletins as part of a rotary plan under which we rotate the advertising copy from one bulletin location to another within a particular market at stated intervals (usually every sixty to ninety days) to achieve greater reach within that market. 
 Posters are smaller advertising structures (the most common size is 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, or 253 square feet; we also operate junior posters, which are 5 feet high by 11 feet wide, or 55 square feet). Poster panels utilize a single flexible sheet of polyethylene material that inserts onto the face of the panel. Posters are concentrated on major traffic arteries and target vehicular traffic, and junior posters are concentrated on city streets and target hard-to-reach pedestrian traffic and nearby residents. At December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 81,600 poster displays. 
 We generally rent poster space for 4 to 26 weeks, determined by the advertiser s campaign needs. Posters are sold in packages of Target Rating Point TRP levels, which determine the percentage of a target audience an advertiser needs to reach. A package may include a combination of poster locations in order to meet reach and frequency campaign goals. 
 In addition to the traditional static displays, we also rent digital billboards. Digital billboards are large electronic light emitting diode LED displays (the most common sizes are 14 feet high by 48 feet wide, or 672 square feet; 10.5 feet high by 36 feet wide, or 378 square feet; and 10 feet high by 21 feet wide, or 210 square feet) that are generally located on major traffic arteries and city streets. Digital billboards are capable of generating over one billion colors and vary in brightness based on ambient conditions. They display completely digital advertising copy from various advertisers in a slide show fashion, rotating each advertisement approximately every 6 to 8 seconds. At December 31, 2022, our inventory included approximately 4,500 digital display billboards in various markets. These 4,500 digital billboards generated approximately 30 of billboard advertising net revenue. 
 We own the physical structures on which the advertising copy is displayed. We build the structures on locations we either own or lease. In each local office, one employee typically performs site leasing activities for the markets served by that office. See Item 2. Properties. 
 In the majority of our markets, our local production staffs perform the full range of activities required to create and install billboard advertising displays. Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the designs on the displays. Our talented design staff uses state-of-the-art technology to prepare creative, eye-catching displays for our tenants. We can also help with the strategic placement of advertisements throughout an advertiser s market by using software that allows us to analyze the target audience and its demographics. Our artists also assist in developing marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new tenant advertisers. 
 In marketing billboard displays to advertisers, we compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising and other media. When selecting the media and provider through which to advertise, advertisers consider a number of factors and advertising providers, which are described in the section titled Competition below.

 Logo Sign Advertising 
 We entered the logo sign advertising business in 1988 and have become the largest provider of logo sign services in the United States, operating 23 of the 26 privatized state logo contracts. We erect logo signs, which generally advertise nearby gas, food, camping, lodging and other attractions, and directional signs, which direct vehicle traffic to nearby services and tourist attractions, near highway exits. As of December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 42,400 logo sign structures containing approximately 139,000 logo advertising displays in the United States and Canada. 
 We operate the logo sign contracts in the province of Ontario, Canada and in the following states: 
 Colorado Kansas Minnesota Montana New Hampshire Ohio Tennessee Delaware Kentucky Mississippi Nebraska New Jersey Oklahoma Utah Florida Louisiana Missouri (1) 
 Nevada New Mexico South Carolina Wisconsin Georgia Michigan 
 
 (1) The logo sign contract in Missouri is operated by a 66 2/3 owned partnership. 
 We also operate the tourist oriented directional signing TODS programs for the states of Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, and the province of Ontario, Canada, providing approximately 16,400 advertising displays. 
 Our logo and TODS operations are decentralized. Generally, each office is staffed with an experienced local general manager, local sales and office staff and a local signing sub-contractor. This decentralization allows the management staff of Interstate Logos, L.L.C. (the subsidiary that operates all of the logo and directional sign-related businesses) to travel extensively to the various operations and serve in a technical and management advisory capacity and monitor regulatory and contract compliance. We also run a silk screening operation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and a display construction company in Atlanta, Georgia. 
 State logo sign contracts represent the exclusive right to erect and operate logo signs within a state for a period of time. The terms of the contracts vary, but generally range from five to ten years, with additional renewal terms. Each logo sign contract generally allows the state to terminate the contract prior to its expiration and, in most cases, with compensation for the termination to be paid to the Company. When a logo sign contract expires, we transfer ownership of the advertising structures to the state. Depending on the contract, we may or may not be entitled to compensation at that time. Of our 24 logo sign contracts in place, in the United States and Canada, at December 31, 2022, 4 are subject to renewal or expiration in 2023. 
 States usually award new logo sign contracts and renew expiring logo sign contracts through an open proposal process. In bidding for new and renewal contracts, we compete against other logo sign providers, as well as local companies based in the state soliciting proposals. 
 In marketing logo signs to advertisers, we compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising and other media. When selecting the media and provider through which to advertise, advertisers consider a number of factors and advertising providers which are described in the section titled Competition below. 
 Transit Advertising 
 We entered into the transit advertising business in 1993 as a way to complement our existing business and maintain market share in certain markets. Transit contracts are generally with the local municipalities and airport authorities and allow us the exclusive right to rent advertising space to customers in airports and on buses, benches or shelters. The terms of the contracts vary but generally range between 3-10 years, many with renewable options for contract extension. We rent transit advertising displays in airport terminals and on bus shelters, benches and buses in over 80 transit markets, and our production staff provides a full range of creative and installation services to our transit advertising tenants. As of December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 47,500 transit advertising displays in 24 states and Canada. 
 Municipalities usually award new transit advertising contracts and renew expiring transit advertising contracts through an open bidding process. In bidding for new and renewal contracts, we compete against national outdoor advertising providers and local, on-premise sign providers and sign construction companies. Transit advertising operators incur significant start-up costs to build and install the advertising structures (such as transit shelters) upon being awarded contracts.

 In marketing transit advertising displays to advertisers, we compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising and other media. When selecting the media and provider through which to advertise, advertisers consider a number of factors and advertising providers which are described in the section titled Competition below. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 Although the outdoor advertising industry has encountered a wave of consolidation, the industry remains fragmented. The industry is comprised of several large outdoor advertising and media companies with operations in multiple markets, as well as smaller, local companies operating a limited number of structures in one or a few local markets. 
 Although we primarily focus on small to mid-size markets where we can attain a strong market share, in each of our markets we compete against other providers of outdoor advertising and other types of media, including: 
 Larger outdoor advertising providers, such as (i) Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., which operates billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays and (ii) Outfront Media, Inc., which operates traditional outdoor, street furniture and transit advertising properties. 
 Broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail marketing, the internet, social media and applications used in conjunction with wireless devices. 
 An increasing variety of out-of-home advertising media, such as advertising displays in shopping centers, malls, airports, stadiums, movie theaters, supermarkets and advertising displays on taxis, trains and buses. 
 In selecting the form of media through which to advertise, advertisers evaluate their ability to target audiences having a specific demographic profile, lifestyle, brand or media consumption or purchasing behavior or audiences located in, or traveling through, a particular geography. Advertisers also compare the relative costs of available media, evaluating the number of impressions (potential viewings), exposure (the opportunity for advertising to be seen) and circulation (traffic volume in a market), as well as potential effectiveness, quality of related services (such as advertising copy design and layout) and customer service. In competing with other media, we believe that outdoor advertising is relatively more cost-efficient than other media, allowing advertisers to reach broader audiences and target specific geographic areas or demographic groups within markets. 
 We believe that our strong emphasis on sales and customer service and our position as a major provider of advertising services in each of our primary markets enables us to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as with other media, within those markets.

 TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES 
 We hold and operate certain of our assets that cannot be held and operated directly by a REIT through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that pays corporate taxes on its taxable income. The assets held in our TRSs primarily consist of our transit advertising business, advertising services business and our foreign operations. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries QRSs or other disregarded entities, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. 
 Our TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes. Furthermore, our assets and operations outside the United States will continue to be subject to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Net income from our TRSs will either be retained by our TRSs and used to fund their operations, or distributed to us, where it will be reinvested in our business or be available for distribution to Lamar Advertising s stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, the annual revenue generated by our TRSs in the aggregate was approximately 323.2 million.

 REGULATION 
 Outdoor advertising is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Regulations generally restrict the size, spacing, lighting and other aspects of advertising structures and pose a significant barrier to entry and expansion in many markets. Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the HBA ), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads. The HBA requires states, through the adoption of individual Federal/State agreements, to effectively control outdoor advertising along these roads, and mandates a state compliance program and state standards regarding size, spacing and lighting. These state standards, or their local and municipal equivalents, may be modified over time in response to legal challenges or otherwise, which may have an adverse effect on our business. The HBA requires any state or political subdivision that compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a Federal Aid Primary or Interstate highway to pay just compensation to the billboard owner. 
 All states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations at least as restrictive as the federal requirements, including laws requiring the removal of illegal signs at the owner s expense (and without compensation from the state). Although we believe that the number of our billboards that may be subject to removal as illegal is immaterial, and no state in which we operate has banned billboards entirely, from time to time governments have required us to remove signs and billboards legally erected in accordance with federal, state and local permit requirements and laws. Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes. We contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business. 
 Using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, state governments have purchased and removed billboards for beautification, and may do so again in the future. Under the power of eminent domain, state or municipal governments have laid claim to property and forced the removal of billboards. Under a concept called amortization by which a governmental body asserts that a billboard operator has earned compensation by continued operation over time, local governments have attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (i.e., billboards that conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations). Although the legality of amortization is questionable, it has been upheld in some instances. Often, municipal and county governments also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws, with some local governments prohibiting construction of new billboards or allowing new construction only to replace existing structures. Although we have generally been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for those of our billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action, there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.

 We have continued to expand the deployment of digital billboards, which display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change every 6 to 8 seconds. We have encountered some existing regulations that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays, but it has not yet materially impacted our digital deployment. However, new regulations could be enacted to impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. 
 The findings of future studies related to the impact of digital billboards on driver safety issues, if any, may result in regulations at the federal or state level that impose greater restrictions on digital billboards. Any new restrictions on digital billboards could have a material adverse effect on both our existing inventory of digital billboards and our plans to expand our digital deployment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including disputes involving advertising contracts, site leases, employment claims and construction matters. We are also involved in routine administrative and judicial proceedings regarding billboard permits, fees and compensation for condemnations. We are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO 
 Our management headquarters is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We also own 128 local operating facilities with front office administration and sales office space connected to back-shop poster and bulletin production space. In addition, we lease an additional 149 operating facilities at an aggregate lease expense for 2022 of approximately 9.2 million. 
 We own approximately 10,500 parcels of property beneath our advertising displays. As of December 31, 2022, we leased approximately 72,500 outdoor sites, accounting for an annualized lease expense of approximately 319.3 million. This amount represented approximately 18 of billboard advertising net revenues for that period. These leases are for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to a term of over ten years, and many provide us with renewal options. Our lease agreements generally permit us to use the land for the construction, repair and relocation of outdoor advertising displays, including all rights necessary to access and maintain the site. Approximately 75 of our leases will expire or be subject to renewal in the next 5 years, 15 will expire or be subject to renewal in 6 to 10 years and 10 thereafter. There is no significant concentration of displays under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord. An important part of our management activity is to manage our lease portfolio and negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions.

 CONTRACT EXPIRATIONS 
 We derive revenues primarily from renting advertising space to customers on our advertising displays. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from one week to one year and are generally billed every four weeks. Since contract terms are short-term in nature, we do not consider revenues by year of contract expiration to be meaningful. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our People. We employed approximately 3,500 people as of December 31, 2022. Approximately 300 employees were engaged in overall management and general administration at our corporate headquarters in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the remainder, including approximately 950 local account executives, were employed in our operating offices. 
 Fifteen of our local offices employ billposters and construction personnel who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees, including our approximately 100 unionized employees, is favorable, and we have never experienced a strike or work stoppage. 
 As Lamar s business continues to grow, so does the Company s strong commitment to recruiting a work force with diverse talents, as well as to developing and retaining the successful members of our sales and management teams. Our 950 local account executives and approximately 175 local management employees have been with the Company for an average of 12 years. We regularly provide on-site training and remote sales training videos to enhance the skills of our sales and management team members.

Table of Contents 

 We employ approximately 1,150 operations employees, including operations management. These employees are responsible for installing advertising copy, maintaining our billboard inventory and ensuring our billboards, logos and transit displays are in safe operating condition. We empower these employees to have a safety-first mentality, which includes the authority to stop an installation or other work job for any safety concern. We also provide training and certification to our operations employees, including training for crane operations and climbing safety. Our management regularly conducts scheduled safety meetings and unscheduled job observations to ensure that we maintain a safety mindset every day. 
 Diversity and inclusion. We recognize that our organization grows stronger as we are able to draw on the skills of employees with a variety of backgrounds and life experiences, particularly as the audiences that we serve become more diverse. We want to embrace Lamar employees unique differences of race, gender and gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, language, ability, age, religious commitment, veteran status, or political perspective. As such, we are committed to cultivating a culture where all employees see the opportunity to show up to work as their most authentic selves. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 36 of our work force was female, 17 of our employees and 33 of our named executive offices identified themselves as minorities, while 33 of our Board of Directors was female and one of our nine directors was a member of a minority group. 
 We have established several initiatives aimed at further diversifying our work force, including establishing an alliance with a hiring network that helps bring us a more diverse pool of candidates and creating an internal women s leadership network that provides our female leaders with tools and a supportive community to help them develop into senior-level managers. Our Executive Vice President of Human Resources, who also serves as our Chief Diversity Officer, is charged with providing training that reinforces our commitment to treat all of our employees with dignity and respect. 
 
 INFLATION 
 During 2020 and 2021 inflation did not have a significant impact on our business. During 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced increases in our direct and general and administrative costs, including increases in labor costs and utilities. Increases in expenses were largely offset by increases in our advertising rates. We also experienced increased interest expenses related to rising interest rates. We expect the inflationary environment and these pressures to continue into 2023. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 Our revenues and operating results are subject to seasonality. Typically, we experience our strongest financial performance in the summer and fall, and our weakest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, partly because retailers cut back their advertising spending immediately following the holiday shopping season. We expect this trend to continue in the future. Because a significant portion of our expenses is fixed, a reduction in revenues in any quarter is likely to result in a period-to-period decline in operating performance and net earnings. 
 
 AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports available free of charge through our website, www.lamar.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing them with, or furnishing them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure 
 The Company s substantial debt may adversely affect its business, financial condition and financial results. 
 The Company has borrowed substantially in the past and will continue to borrow in the future. At December 31, 2022, Lamar Advertising Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media, had approximately 3.31 billion of total debt outstanding, net of deferred financing costs, consisting of approximately 985.8 million in bank debt outstanding under Lamar Media s senior credit facility, 2.08 billion in various series of senior notes, 249.4 million under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program and 2.0 million in other seller notes. Despite the level of debt presently outstanding, the terms of the indentures governing Lamar Media s notes and the terms of the senior credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program allow Lamar Media to incur substantially more debt, including approximately 694.0 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Company s substantial debt and its use of cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on its debt may, among other things: 
 make it more difficult for the Company to comply with the financial covenants in its senior credit facility and in its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, which could result in a default and an acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the facility or under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program; 
 limit the cash flow available to fund the Company s working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; 
 limit the Company s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future dividend distributions, working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements; 
 place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to those of its competitors that have less debt; 
 force the Company to seek and obtain alternate or additional sources of funding, which may be unavailable, or may be on less favorable terms, or may require the Company to obtain the consent of lenders under its senior credit facility or the holders of its other debt; 
 limit the Company s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and industry; and 
 increase the Company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. 
 
 Lamar Media has variable rate debt outstanding under the senior credit facility and its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Increases in the interest rates applicable to these borrowings have recently resulted in increased interest expense, which has impacted the Company's net income. Interest rates may continue to increase as a result of macroeconomic factors outside of our control. The Company may take actions in the future to mitigate its interest rate exposure, however, it cannot guarantee that the actions that it takes to mitigate these risks will be effective. Additionally, to the extent we refinance existing debt obligations or seek to enter into new debt financing arrangements in the current interest rate environment, we expect that such arrangements would be subject to higher interest rates than our existing debt obligations, which would further increase our interest expense. 
 Any of these problems could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and financial results. 
 The Company may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its significant debt service obligations. 
 The Company s ability to generate cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on its debt will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors. The Company cannot control many of these factors, including general economic conditions, its customers allocation of advertising expenditures among available media and the amount spent on advertising in general, and its business would be negatively impacted if the general economy were to deteriorate in the future. If its operations do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt service obligations, the Company may need to borrow additional funds to make these payments or undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its debt, or reducing or delaying capital investments and acquisitions. The Company cannot guarantee that such additional funds or alternative financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. The Company s inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional funds or alternative financing on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents 

 Restrictions in the Company s and Lamar Media s debt agreements reduce operating flexibility and contain covenants and restrictions that create the potential for defaults, which could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and financial results. 
 The terms of Lamar Media s senior credit facility and the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes restrict the ability of the Company and Lamar Media to, among other things: 
 incur or repay debt; 
 dispose of assets; 
 create liens; 
 make investments; 
 enter into affiliate transactions; and 
 pay dividends and make inter-company distributions. 
 At December 31, 2022, the terms of Lamar Media s senior credit facility and of its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program also restrict the Company from exceeding a specified secured debt ratio. Lamar Media is also subject to certain other financial covenants relating to the incurrence of additional debt. Please see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for a description of the specific financial ratio requirements under the senior credit facility. 
 The Company s ability to comply with the financial covenants in the senior credit facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Program and the indentures governing Lamar Media s outstanding notes (and to comply with similar covenants in any future agreements) depends on its operating performance, which in turn depends significantly on prevailing economic, financial and business conditions and other factors that are beyond the Company s control. Therefore, despite its best efforts and execution of its strategic plan, the Company may be unable to comply with these financial covenants in the future. 
 The Company is currently in compliance with all financial covenants. However, if in the future there are economic declines the Company can make no assurance that these declines will not negatively impact the Company s financial results and, in turn, its ability to meet these financial covenant requirements. If Lamar Media fails to comply with its financial covenants, Lamar Media could be in default under the senior credit facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program (which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing its outstanding notes). In the event of such a default under the senior credit facility, the lenders under the senior credit facility could accelerate all of the debt outstanding, could elect to institute foreclosure proceedings against Lamar Media s assets, and it could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of these events could adversely affect Lamar Media s business, financial condition and financial results. In the event of such a default under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, the lenders under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program could accelerate all of the debt outstanding, could elect to institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries (as defined herein), and the Special Purpose Subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of these events could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and financial results. 
 In addition, these restrictions reduce the Company s operating flexibility and could prevent the Company from exploiting investment, acquisition, marketing, or other time-sensitive business opportunities. 
 The Company is controlled by significant stockholders who have the power to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval and whose interest in the Company may be different than yours. 
 As of December 31, 2022, members of the Reilly family, including Kevin P. Reilly, Jr., the Company s Executive Chairman, and Sean Reilly, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, and their affiliates, owned in the aggregate approximately 15 of the Company s outstanding common stock, assuming the conversion of all Class B common stock to Class A common stock. As of that date, their combined holdings represented approximately 62 of the voting power of Lamar Advertising s outstanding capital stock, which would give the Reilly family and their affiliates the power to: 
 elect the Company s entire Board of Directors; 
 control the Company s management and policies; and 
 determine the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter requiring stockholder approval, including charter amendments, mergers, consolidations, financings and asset sales. 
 The Reilly family may have interests that are different than yours in making these decisions.

 Our UPREIT structure may result in potential conflicts of interest. 
 We are structured as an UPREIT, which stands for umbrella partnership real estate investment trust. While limited partners of Lamar Advertising Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership do not generally have any right to participate in or exercise management power over the business and affairs of the Operating Partnership, they do have the right to vote on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, as well as on certain other matters. Persons holding such voting rights may exercise them in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. 
 The partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership provides that, for so long as we own a controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, any conflict that cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners shall be resolved by the general partner in favor of our stockholders. Circumstances may arise in the future when the interests of limited partners in the Operating Partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 The Company s growth through acquisitions may be difficult, which could adversely affect our future financial performance. In addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate any completed acquisitions, our financial performance would also be adversely affected. 
 The Company has historically grown through acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately 479.8 million. 
 The future success of our acquisition strategy could be adversely affected by many factors, including the following: 
 the pool of suitable acquisition candidates is dwindling, and we may have a more difficult time negotiating acquisitions on favorable terms; 
 we may face increased competition for acquisition candidates from other outdoor advertising companies and private equity funds (particularly funds that are focused on investing in media and/or infastruc, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do, which may result in higher prices for those businesses and assets; 
 we may not have access to the capital needed to finance potential acquisitions and may be unable to obtain any required consents from our current lenders to obtain alternate financing; 
 compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain investments and may limit our acquisition opportunities; 
 we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and assets effectively with our existing operations and systems as a result of unforeseen difficulties that could divert significant time, attention and effort from management that could otherwise be directed at developing existing business; 
 we may be unable to retain key personnel of acquired businesses; 
 we may not realize the benefits and cost savings anticipated in our acquisitions; and 
 as the industry consolidates further, larger mergers and acquisitions may face substantial scrutiny under antitrust laws. 
 These obstacles to our opportunistic acquisition strategy may have an adverse effect on our future financial results. 
 The Company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 The Company tested goodwill for impairment on December 31, 2022. Based on the Company s review at December 31, 2022, no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to assess whether factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim impairment test between our annual impairment test dates. For instance, if our market capitalization is below our equity book value for a period of time without recovery, we believe there is a strong presumption that would indicate a triggering event has occurred and it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or both of our reporting units is below the carrying amount. This would require us to test the reporting units for impairment of goodwill. If this presumption cannot be overcome a reporting unit could be impaired under ASC 350 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and a non-cash charge would be required. Any such charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company s net earnings.

 The Company s logo sign contracts are subject to state award and renewal. 
 In 2022, the Company generated approximately 4 of its revenues from state-awarded logo sign contracts. In bidding for these contracts, the Company competes against other national logo sign providers as well as numerous smaller local logo sign providers. As a logo sign provider, the Company incurs significant start-up costs upon being awarded a new contract. These contracts generally have a term of five to ten years, with additional renewal periods. Some states reserve the right to terminate a contract early, and most contracts require the state to pay compensation to the Company as a logo sign provider for early termination. At the end of the contract term, the Company, as a logo sign provider, transfers ownership of the logo sign structures to the state. Depending on the contract, the logo provider may or may not be entitled to compensation for the structures at the end of the contract term. 
 Of the Company s 24 logo sign contracts in place at December 31, 2022, 4 are subject to renewal or expiration in 2023. The Company may be unable to renew its expiring contracts. The Company may also lose the bidding on new contracts. 
 If the Company s contingency plans relating to hurricanes and other natural disasters fail, the resulting losses could hurt the Company s business. 
 The Company has determined that it is uneconomical to insure against losses resulting from hurricanes and other natural disasters. Although the Company has developed contingency plans designed to mitigate the threat posed by hurricanes and other forms of inclement weather to its real estate portfolio (e.g., removing advertising faces at the onset of a storm, when possible, which better permits the structures to withstand high winds during the storm), these plans could fail and significant losses could result. To the extent that such natural disaster events become more frequent or destructive because of climate change, we may incur increased costs related to storm remediation and preparation. 
 Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. 
 A REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. The Company may have available net operating loss NOL carry forwards that could reduce or substantially eliminate its REIT taxable income, and thus it may not be required to distribute material amounts of cash to qualify for taxation as a REIT. The Company expects that, for the foreseeable future, it may utilize available NOL carry forwards to reduce its REIT taxable income. 
 The Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to its stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the Company s results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program, and general market demand for its advertising space available for rent. Consequently, the Company s distribution levels may fluctuate. 
 The Lamar Advertising charter, the Lamar Advertising bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of Lamar Advertising stock. 
 Provisions of the Lamar Advertising charter, the Lamar Advertising bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of Lamar Advertising without the approval of the Board of Directors. These provisions: 
 impose restrictions on ownership and transfer of Lamar Advertising common stock that are intended to facilitate the Company s compliance with certain REIT rules relating to share ownership; 
 limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders; 
 establish advance notice and informational requirements and time limitations on any director nomination or proposal that a stockholder wishes to make at a meeting of stockholders; 
 do not permit cumulative voting in the election of its directors, which would otherwise permit less than a majority of stockholders to elect directors; and 
 provide the Board of Directors the ability to issue additional classes and shares of preferred stock and to set voting rights, preferences and other terms of the preferred stock without stockholder approval. 
 In addition, Section 203 of the DGCL generally limits the Company s ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock or any of its associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock.

 These provisions may have the effect of entrenching the Company s management team and may deprive the Company s stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of Lamar Advertising common stock. 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 The Company s revenues are sensitive to the state of the economy and the financial markets generally and other external events beyond the Company s control. 
 The Company rents advertising space on outdoor structures to generate revenues. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. 
 Additionally, the occurrence of any of the following external events could further depress the Company s revenues: 
 a widespread reallocation of advertising expenditures to other available media by significant renters of the Company s displays; and 
 a decline in the amount spent on advertising, in general, or outdoor advertising in particular as a result of macroeconomic factors. 
 The Company faces competition from larger and more diversified outdoor advertisers and other forms of advertising that could hurt its performance. 
 While the Company enjoys a significant market share in many of its small and medium-sized markets, the Company faces competition from other outdoor advertisers and other media in all of its markets. Although the Company is one of the largest companies focusing exclusively on outdoor advertising in a relatively fragmented industry, it competes against larger companies with diversified operations, such as television, radio and other broadcast media. These diversified competitors have the advantage of cross-selling complementary advertising products to advertisers. 
 The Company also competes against an increasing variety of out-of-home advertising media, such as advertising displays in shopping centers, malls, airports, stadiums, movie theaters and supermarkets, and on taxis, trains and buses. To a lesser extent, the Company also faces competition from other forms of media, including radio, newspapers, direct mail advertising, telephone directories and the Internet. The industry competes for advertising revenue along the following dimensions: exposure (the number of impressions an advertisement makes), advertising rates (generally measured in cost-per-thousand impressions), ability to target specific demographic groups or geographies, effectiveness, quality of related services (such as advertising copy design and layout) and customer service. The Company may be unable to compete successfully along these dimensions in the future, and the competitive pressures that the Company faces could adversely affect its profitability or financial performance. 
 Federal, state and local regulation impact the Company s operations, financial condition and financial results. 
 Outdoor advertising is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Regulations generally restrict the size, spacing, lighting and other aspects of advertising structures and pose a significant barrier to entry and expansion in many markets. Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, or the HBA, regulates outdoor advertising on Federal Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads. The HBA requires states, through the adoption of individual Federal/State Agreements, to effectively control outdoor advertising along these roads, and mandates a state compliance program and state standards regarding size, spacing and lighting. These state standards, or their local and municipal equivalents, may be modified over time in response to legal challenges or otherwise, which may have an adverse effect on our business. The HBA requires any state or political subdivision that compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a Federal Aid Primary or Interstate highway to pay just compensation to the billboard owner. 
 All states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations at least as restrictive as the federal requirements, including laws requiring the removal of illegal signs at the owner s expense (and without compensation from the state). Although the Company believes that the number of our billboards that may be subject to removal as illegal is immaterial, and no state in which we operate has banned billboards entirely, from time to time governments have required us to remove signs and billboards legally erected in accordance with federal, state and local permit requirements and laws. Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes. We contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business. 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 Using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, state governments have purchased and removed billboards for beautification, and may do so again in the future. Under the power of eminent domain, state or municipal governments have laid claim to property and forced the removal of billboards. Under a concept called amortization by which a governmental body asserts that a billboard operator has earned compensation by continued operation over time, local governments have attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (i.e., billboards that conformed to applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations). Although the legality of amortization is questionable, it has been upheld in some instances. Often, municipal and county governments also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws, with some local governments prohibiting construction of new billboards or allowing new construction only to replace existing structures. Although we have generally been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for those of our billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action, there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. 
 We have continued to expand the deployment of digital billboards, which display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change every 6 to 8 seconds. We have encountered some existing regulations that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays but it has not yet materially impacted our digital deployment. However, new regulations could be enacted to impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. 
 The findings of future studies related to the impact of digital billboards on driver safety issues, if any, may result in regulations at the federal or state level that impose greater restrictions on digital billboards. Any new restrictions on digital billboards could have a material adverse effect on both our existing inventory of digital billboards and our plans to expand our digital deployment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. 
 The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, has generally increased and become more sophisticated over time. Although we have implemented physical and electronic security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets, proprietary business information and any personal identifiable information PII that we collect, no security measures are impenetrable and we and outside parties we interact with may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. An increase in the number of our employees and outside parties with which we do business working remotely may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident, which has required us to modify our security measures. 
 If an actual or perceived breach of our security were to occur, proprietary or competitive information may be misappropriated, and we could experience disruptions in our business operations, information processes and internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures may be harmed and adversely affect our competitive position. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer significant legal and financial exposure in connection with remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings, which could lead to the need for additional resources in our security and system protection measures. 
 We have been and expect to continue to be the target of fraudulent activities and security breaches; however, to date they have not had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 We could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability matters. 
 Governments, shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and growing. We may incur costs related to ESG initiatives, including those related to producing enhanced mandatory or voluntary disclosures about our business. If we are unable to respond effectively to ESG matters, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT 
 If Lamar Advertising fails to remain qualified as a REIT, both Lamar Advertising and Lamar Media would be taxed as regular C corporations and would not be able to deduct distributions to the stockholders of Lamar Advertising when computing their taxable income. 
 Lamar Advertising elected to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes starting with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and for each subsequent taxable year thereafter. REIT qualification involves the application of highly 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code to Lamar Advertising s assets and operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although Lamar Advertising plans to operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, the Company cannot assure you that it will so qualify or remain so qualified. Lamar Media is treated as a qualified REIT subsidiary of Lamar Advertising that is disregarded as separate from its parent REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 If, in any taxable year, Lamar Advertising fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and is not entitled to relief under the Code: 
 it will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income; 
 it and its corporate subsidiaries, including Lamar Media, will be subject to applicable federal and state income tax, including any applicable state-level alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate rates; and 
 it would be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years following the year during which it was so disqualified. 
 Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to Lamar Advertising s stockholders, may require it to borrow funds (under Lamar Media s senior credit facility or otherwise) or liquidate some investments to pay any such additional tax liability. This adverse impact could last for five or more years because, unless it is entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, it will be taxable as a corporation, beginning in the year in which the failure occurs, and it will not be allowed to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT for the following four years. 
 Even if it qualifies as a REIT, certain of Lamar Advertising s and its subsidiaries business activities will be subject to U.S. and foreign taxes which will continue to reduce its cash flows, and it will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. 
 Even if it qualifies as a REIT, Lamar Advertising may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes and foreign taxes on its income and assets, including any applicable state-level alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, the Company could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. 
 In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company holds certain of its non-qualifying REIT assets and receives certain non-qualifying items of income through one or more TRSs. These non-qualifying REIT assets consist principally of the Company s advertising services business and its transit advertising business. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes. Furthermore, the Company s assets and operations outside the United States are subject to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. In addition, the Company may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease the Company s earnings and its cash available for distributions to stockholders. 
 The Company was subject to a U.S. federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 21 on all or a portion of the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within five years after the effective date of our REIT conversion, to the extent of the built-in gain based on the fair market value of those assets held by the Company on the effective date of REIT conversion in excess of the Company s then tax basis in those assets. Such five-year period has expired with respect to the Company but certain tax years for which this rule applied remain open such that additional taxes could be assessed with respect to sales in those tax years. The same rules apply to any assets we acquire from a C corporation in a carry-over basis transaction with built-in gain at the time of the acquisition by us. Gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax. 
 
 Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates on dividend income from non-REIT corporations. 
 Qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at reduced rates. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced qualified dividend rates. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026, non-corporate taxpayers may generally deduct 20 of certain pass-through business income, including qualified REIT dividends (generally, dividends received by a REIT shareholder that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income), subject to certain limitations. Although this deduction 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs, such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends. This may cause investors to view REIT investments as less attractive than investments in non-REIT corporations, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our stock. 
 
 Gain on disposition of assets deemed held for sale in the ordinary course of business is subject to 100 tax. 
 If we sell any of our assets, the IRS may determine that the sale is a disposition of an asset held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Gain from this kind of sale will generally be subject to a 100 tax. Whether an asset is held "primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business" depends on the particular facts and circumstances of the sale. Although we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe-harbor provisions in the Internal Revenue Code prescribing when asset sales will not be so characterized, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. 
 
 Failure to make sufficient distributions would jeopardize Lamar Advertising s qualification as a REIT and/or would subject it to U.S. federal income and excise taxes. 
 As a REIT, Lamar Advertising is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each taxable year at least 90 of its REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains and net of any available NOL carry forwards) in order to qualify as a REIT, and 100 of its REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains and net of any available NOL carry forwards) in order to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. For these purposes, Lamar Advertising s subsidiaries that are not TRSs, including Lamar Media, will be treated as part of the REIT and therefore Lamar Advertising also will be required to distribute out their taxable income. 
 Because the REIT distribution requirements will prevent us from retaining earnings, we may be required to refinance debt at maturity with additional debt or equity, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 
 Covenants specified in our existing and future debt instruments may limit Lamar Advertising s ability to make required REIT distributions. 
 Lamar Media s senior credit facility and the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes contain certain covenants that could limit Lamar Advertising s distributions to its stockholders. If these limits prevent Lamar Advertising from satisfying its REIT distribution requirements, it could fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize Lamar Advertising s qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent it from distributing 100 of its REIT taxable income, it will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts. 
 Lamar Advertising and its subsidiaries may be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or raise equity to satisfy its REIT distribution requirements or maintain the asset tests. 
 In order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain its qualification and taxation as a REIT and avoid corporate income taxes, Lamar Advertising and/or its subsidiaries, including Lamar Media, may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. Any insufficiency of its cash flows to cover Lamar Advertising s REIT distribution requirements could require it to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain its qualification and taxation as a REIT and avoid corporate income taxes. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing Lamar Advertising needs to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase its total leverage. 
 In addition, if Lamar Advertising fails to comply with certain asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter, it must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification. As a result, it may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce its income and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 Complying with REIT requirements may cause Lamar Advertising, its subsidiaries (other than TRSs) to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. 
 To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Lamar Advertising must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts it distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of Lamar Advertising common stock. For these purposes, Lamar Advertising is treated as owning the assets of and receiving or accruing the income of its subsidiaries (other than TRSs). Thus, compliance with these tests will require Lamar Advertising and its subsidiaries to refrain from certain activities and may hinder their ability to make certain attractive investments, including investments in the businesses to be conducted by TRSs, and to that extent limit their opportunities. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if Lamar Advertising needs or requires the target company to comply with certain REIT requirements prior to closing. 
 Ownership limitations contained in the Lamar Advertising charter may restrict stockholders from acquiring or transferring certain amounts of shares. 
 In order for Lamar Advertising to remain qualified as a REIT, no more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of its stock may be owned, directly or indirectly or through application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) at any time during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). To preserve its REIT qualification, the Lamar Advertising charter generally prohibits any person or entity from owning actually and by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions more than 5 of the outstanding shares of Lamar Advertising common stock. These ownership limitations could restrict stockholders from acquiring or transferring certain amounts of shares of its stock. The Lamar Advertising charter also provides a separate share ownership limitation for certain members of the Reilly family and their affiliates that allows them to own actually and by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions no more than 19 of the outstanding shares of Lamar Advertising common stock and, during the second half of any taxable year other than its first taxable year as a REIT, no more than 33 in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of its stock, in each case excluding any shares of its stock that are not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes. 
 
 If Lamar Advertising s operating partnership does not qualify as a partnership, its income may be subject to taxation, and Lamar Advertising would no longer qualify as a REIT. 
 The Internal Revenue Code classifies publicly traded partnerships as associations taxable as corporations (rather than as partnerships), unless substantially all of their taxable income consists of specified types of passive income. Lamar Advertising structured the Operating Partnership to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However, no assurance can be given the IRS will not challenge Lamar Advertising s position or will classify the Operating Partnership as a publicly traded partnership for federal income tax purposes. To minimize this risk, Lamar Advertising has placed certain restrictions on the transfer and/or redemption of partnership units in the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership. If the IRS would assert successfully that the Operating Partnership should be treated as a publicly traded partnership and substantially all of the Operating Partnership s gross income did not consist of the specified types of passive income, the Internal Revenue Code would treat the Operating partnership as an association taxable as a corporation. In such event, Lamar Advertising would cease to qualify as a REIT. In addition, the imposition of a corporate tax on the Operating Partnership would reduce the amount of distributions the Operating Partnership could make to Lamar Advertising and, in turn, reduce the amount of cash available to Lamar Advertising to pay dividends to our shareholders. 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CARES Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as any future tax legislation, may impact the Company s business and security holders. 
 On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA made major changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of REITs and their stockholders. Among the changes made by the TCJA are permanently reducing the generally applicable corporate tax rate, generally reducing the tax rate applicable to individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, eliminating or modifying certain previously allowed deductions (including substantially limiting interest deductibility and, for individuals, the deduction for non-business state and local taxes). On March 27, 2020, legislation intended to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), was signed into law. The CARES Act made technical corrections, or temporary modifications, to certain of the provisions of the TCJA, including, without limitation, the provisions of the TCJA concerning NOLs and interest expense deductions. Certain CARES Act related interest expense deduction changes are discussed in the following subsection. With respect to NOLs, effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the TCJA limited the deduction for NOL carryforwards to 80 of taxable income (before the deduction) and eliminated NOL carrybacks for individuals and non-REIT corporations (NOL carrybacks did not apply to REITs under prior law), but allows for indefinite NOL carryforwards. The CARES Act repealed such 80 limitation for carryforwards to taxable years beginning before 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 January 1, 2021. The CARES Act also allows a five-year carryback for NOLs arising in 2018, 2019, or 2020. The TCJA s NOL limitations (even as modified by the CARES Act) may result in Lamar Advertising having to make additional distributions in order to comply with REIT distribution requirements or avoid taxes on retained income and gains. 
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ). The IRA includes numerous tax provisions that impact corporations, including the implementation of a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income exceeding 1 billion, as well as a 1 excise tax on certain stock repurchases and economically similar transactions. However, REITs are excluded from the definition of an applicable corporation and therefore are not subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. Additionally, the 1 excise tax specifically does not apply to stock repurchases by REITs. Any taxable REIT subsidiaries of Lamar Advertising operate as standalone corporations and therefore could be adversely affected by the IRA. Lamar Advertising will continue to analyze and monitor the application of the IRA to its business; however, the effect of these changes on the value of Lamar Advertising s assets, shares of Lamar Advertising stock or market conditions, generally, is uncertain. 
 The individual and collective impact of the changes made by the TCJA, the CARES Act and the IRA on REITs and their security holders are uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time. The effect of any technical corrections with respect to the TCJA, the CARES Act or the IRA could have an adverse effect on Lamar Advertising, its subsidiaries, and holders of its securities. It is also possible additional tax legislation could be enacted in the future, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on Lamar Advertising, its subsidiaries, and holders of its securities. 
 Lamar Advertising may potentially be unable to deduct the full amount of its interest expense pursuant to the TCJA and the CARES Act. 
 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, interest deductions for businesses with average annual gross receipts of over 25 million are capped at 30 of the business adjusted taxable income plus business interest income pursuant to the TCJA. For these purposes, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2022, adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to deductions allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. The CARES Act increased the aforementioned 30 limitation to 50 for taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020 and permitted an entity to elect to use its 2019 adjusted taxable income to calculate the applicable limitation for its 2020 taxable year. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, adjusted taxable income is calculated by taking deductions allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion into account. This limitation, however, does not apply to an electing real property trade or business. As a REIT, Lamar Advertising would generally constitute a real property trade or businesses, and thus would retain the ability to fully deduct interest expenses if it makes such an election. However, an entity making such an election must use a longer depreciation cost recovery period for its property. Lamar Advertising has not made such election to date and has not yet determined whether it will make such election at a later date. 
 Legislative changes or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on Lamar Advertising and its subsidiaries. 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative and judicial interpretations of those laws may be amended or interpreted in a different manner. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and state taxing authorities. Additional changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect Lamar Advertising and its subsidiaries. The Company cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations applicable to Lamar Advertising may be changed. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that any such change will not significantly affect Lamar Advertising s ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to it of such qualification. 
 The ability of the Board of Directors of Lamar Advertising to revoke its REIT election, without stockholder approval, may cause adverse consequences to its stockholders. 
 The Lamar Advertising charter provides that the Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate the REIT election, without the approval of its stockholders, if the board determines that it is no longer in the Company s best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company ceases to be a REIT, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and applicable state and local corporate taxes, which may have adverse consequences on its total return to its stockholders.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 Our management headquarters is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We also own 128 local operating facilities with front office administration and sales office space connected to back-shop poster and bulletin production space. In addition, the Company leases an additional 149 operating facilities at an aggregate lease expense for 2022 of approximately 9.2 million. 
 We own approximately 10,500 parcels of property beneath our outdoor advertising structures. As of December 31, 2022, we leased approximately 72,500 active outdoor sites, accounting for a total annual lease expense of approximately 319.3 million. This amount represented approximately 18 of billboard advertising net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. These leases are for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to a term of over ten years, and many provide the Company with renewal options. There is no significant concentration of displays under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord. An important part of our management activity is to manage our lease portfolio and negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company from time to time is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including disputes involving advertising contracts, site leases, employment claims and construction matters. The Company is also involved in routine administrative and judicial proceedings regarding billboard permits, fees and compensation for condemnations. The Company is not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

 The Company s Class A common stock has been publicly traded since August 2, 1996 and is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol LAMR. As of December 31, 2022, the Class A common stock was held by 86 stockholders of record. The Company believes, however, that the actual number of beneficial holders of the Class A common stock may be substantially greater than the stated number of holders of record because a substantial portion of the Class A common stock is held in street name. 
 The Company s Class B common stock is not publicly traded and is held of record by members of the Reilly family and their affiliated entities, including the Reilly Family, LLC (the RFLLC ), formerly the Reilly Family Limited Partnership. Kevin P. Reilly, Jr., our Executive Chairman of the Board, is the executive manager of the RFLLC and Sean E. Reilly, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Wendell Reilly and Anna Reilly, each of whom is a member of our Board of Directors are also managers of the RFLLC. 
 The Company s Series AA preferred stock is entitled to preferential dividends, in an annual aggregate amount of 364,903, before any dividends may be paid on the common stock. All dividends related to the Company s preferred stock are paid on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company s senior credit facility and other indebtedness have terms restricting the payment of dividends. 
 Dividends 
 As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our common stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income to avoid being subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize net operating losses NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On March 16, 2020, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250.0 million of the Company s Class A common stock. On September 20, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the extension of the repurchase program through March 31, 2023. There were no repurchases under the program as of December 31, 2022. On February 23, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the renewal of the repurchase program through September 30, 2024.

 LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY 
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes. 
 Discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 The Company s net revenues are derived primarily from the rental of advertising space on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the Company. Revenue growth is based on many factors that include the Company s ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays; raise advertising rates; and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions, as well as trends in the advertising industry. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, which affect the rates the Company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays. 
 Acquisitions and capital expenditures 
 Historically, the Company has made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. The Company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash, borrowings under the senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources- Sources of Cash, for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed multiple acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately 479.8 million. See Uses of Cash-Acquisitions , for more information. 
 The Company s business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. The following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the past two years: 
 2022 2021 (In thousands) Billboard Traditional 45,415 31,894 Billboard Digital 81,145 55,285 Logos 13,151 12,926 Transit 4,734 2,514 Land and buildings 11,462 14,077 PP E 11,171 9,394 Total capital expenditures 167,078 126,090 
 We expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately 185 million. 
 Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust 
 As previously announced, on July 1, 2022, the Company completed a tax reorganization to a specific type of REIT known as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust ("UPREIT"). The UPREIT structure allows property owners of appreciated properties to contribute property to the operating partnership of the REIT, on a tax-deferred basis, in exchange for a partnership interest in the form of operating partnership units. This reorganization is not expected to have any material impact on the Company's combined financial statements or business operations. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Our management reviews our performance by focusing on several key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States GAAP ). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted EBITDA ), Funds From Operations FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue. 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), equity in (earnings) loss of investee, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, loss (gain) on disposition of assets and investments, transaction expenses and capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net. 
 FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate unconsolidated affiliates and non-controlling interest. 
 We define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line income and expense; (ii) capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net; (iii) stock-based compensation expense; (iv) non-cash portion of tax expense (benefit); (v) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (vi) amortization of deferred financing costs, (vii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (viii) transaction expenses; (ix) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (x) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (xi) an adjustment for unconsolidated affiliates and non-controlling interest. 
 Acquisition-adjusted net revenue adjusts our net revenue for the prior period by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets before our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating acquisition-adjusted revenue, therefore, we include revenue generated by assets that we did not own in the period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as acquisition net revenue . In addition, we also adjust the prior period to subtract revenue generated by the assets that have been divested since the prior period and, therefore, no revenue derived from those assets is reflected in the current period. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as depreciation and amortization may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) acquisition-adjusted net revenue is a supplement to net revenue to enable investors to compare period over period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; (4) adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO each provide investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies. 
 Our measurement of adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included herein.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net revenues 100.0 100.0 Operating expenses: Direct advertising expenses 32.8 32.3 General and administrative expenses 17.3 18.3 Corporate expenses 5.0 5.2 Depreciation and amortization 17.2 15.2 Operating income 28.4 29.2 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1.2 Interest expense 6.3 6.0 Income tax expense 0.9 0.5 Net income 21.6 21.7 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year ended December 31, 2021 
 Net revenues increased 244.7 million or 13.7 to 2.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.79 billion for the same period in 2021. This increase was attributable to an increase in billboard net revenues of 200.4 million, an increase in transit net revenues of 42.3 million and an increase in logo net revenues of 2.0 million over the prior year. 
 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2021, increased 180.6 million, or 9.8 . This increase was attributable to an increase of 142.5 million in billboard net revenues, an increase of 36.3 million in transit net revenues and an increase of 1.8 million in logo net revenues. See Reconciliations below. 
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of assets, increased 123.4 million, or 12.4 to 1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 997.0 million in the same period in 2021. The 123.4 million increase over the prior year is primarily comprised of an increase in total direct, general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and transaction expenses) of 133.8 million primarily related to an increase in our variable billboard lease costs and transit and airport franchise costs, as well as increases in our workforce. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 78.2 million to 349.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 271.3 million for the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to the revision in the cost estimate included in the calculation of asset retirement obligations during 2022, as well as acquisitions and capital expenditures that occurred in the second half of 2021 and during 2022. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a gain on disposition of assets of 15.7 million as compared to a gain on disposition of assets of 2.1 million for the same period in 2021. The gain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from a gain of 12.6 million from a contingent payment received in connection with the Company's 2018 sale of Puerto Rico assets. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased 56.8 million to 578.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 521.2 million for the same period in 2021. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a 21.6 million loss on debt extinguishment related to Lamar Media's repayment of its 5 3/4 Senior Notes. There was no loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Interest expense increased 21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 127.5 million as compared to 106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the increase in interest rates on the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program and senior credit facility.

 Equity in earnings of investee was 4.3 million and 3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of an investment that occurred in July of 2021. 
 The increase in operating income and the decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2021, resulted in a 58.8 million increase in net income before income taxes. 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to income tax expense of 9.3 million for the same period in 2021.The 17.5 million tax expense includes an expense of 6.6 million for the reduction of Puerto Rico deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 17.5 million equates to an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 3.8 , which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items. 
 As a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 438.6 million, as compared to net income of 388.1 million for the same period in 2021. 
 Reconciliations: 
 Because acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2020 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2021 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2021 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Reconciliations of 2021 reported net revenue to 2021 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 as well as a comparison of 2021 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2022 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, are provided below:

 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 13.4 to 938.1 million. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net) of 153.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative and corporate expenses of 43.1 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and transaction expenses.

 FFO for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 757.0 million as compared to FFO of 643.4 million for the same period in 2021. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 12.3 to 749.7 million as compared to 667.7 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in AFFO was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net), partially offset by an increase in total general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense and transaction expenses) and capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our advertising assets. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 The Company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media Corp., is the principal borrower under the senior credit facility and maintains all corporate operating cash balances. Certain subsidiaries of Lamar Media are the principal borrowers under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Any cash requirements of the Company, therefore, must be funded by distributions from Lamar Media. 
 Sources of Cash 
 Total Liquidity. As of December 31, 2022 we had 746.6 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of 52.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 694.0 million of availability under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility. We expect our total liquidity to be adequate for the Company to meet its operational requirements for the next twelve months. We are currently in compliance with the maintenance covenant included in the senior credit facility and we would remain in compliance after giving effect to borrowing the full amount available to us under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility.

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of 361.5 million and 274.4 million, respectively. The working capital deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily related to the 249.4 million outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program as well as 205.8 million in current operating lease liabilities which has a corresponding right of use asset recorded in long term assets. We expect to have enough cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months. 
 Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 our cash provided by operating activities was 781.6 million and 734.4 million, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the same period in 2021 relates to an increase in revenues offset by an increase in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization). We expect to generate cash flows from operations during 2023 in excess of our cash needs for operations, capital expenditures and dividends, as described herein. 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. On June 24, 2022, Lamar Media and the Special Purpose Subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment (the "Sixth Amendment") to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, as amended. The Sixth Amendment increased the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program from 175.0 million to 250.0 million and extended the maturity date of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program to July 21, 2025. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR-based interest rate mechanics with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") based interest rate mechanics for the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Borrowing capacity under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is limited to the availability of eligible accounts receivable collateralizing the borrowings under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. In connection with the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, Lamar Media and certain of its subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Originators sell and/or contribute their existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to one of two special purpose subsidiaries, Lamar QRS Receivables, LLC (the QRS SPV and Lamar TRS Receivables, LLC (the TRS SPV and together with the QRS SPV the Special Purpose Subsidiaries ), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lamar Media. Existing and future accounts receivable relating to Lamar Media and its qualified REIT subsidiaries will be sold and/or contributed to the QRS SPV and existing and future accounts receivable relating to Lamar Media s TRSs will be sold and/or contributed to the TRS SPV. Each of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries has granted the lenders party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program a security interest in all of its assets, which consist of the accounts receivable and related assets sold or contributed to them, as described above, in order to secure the obligations of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Pursuant to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, Lamar Media has agreed to service the accounts receivable on behalf of the two Special Purpose Subsidiaries for a fee. Lamar Media has also agreed to guaranty its performance in its capacity as servicer and originator, as well as the performance of the Subsidiary Originators, of their obligations under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. None of Lamar Media, the Subsidiary Originators or the Special Purpose Subsidiaries guarantees the collectability of the receivables under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. In addition, each of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the assets of such Special Purpose Subsidiary before the assets become available to Lamar Media. Accordingly, the assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries are not available to pay creditors of Lamar Media or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from receivables in excess of the amounts required to repay the lenders and the other creditors of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries may be remitted to Lamar Media. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there was 250.0 million of outstanding aggregate borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program at a borrowing rate of approximately 5.3 . Lamar Media has no additional availability under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program as of December 31, 2022. The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program will mature on July 21, 2025. 
 At-the-Market Offering Program. On May 1, 2018, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Sales Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities LLC and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. as our sales agents. Under the terms of the Sales Agreement, the Company could have, from time to time, issued and sold shares of its Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 400.0 million through the sales agents as either agents or principals. The Sales Agreement expired by its terms on May 1, 2021. The Company did not issue any shares under this program in 2021. 
 On June 21, 2021, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement (the "2021 Sales Agreement"), with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities LLC, Truist Securities, Inc., SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. as our sales agents (each a "Sales Agent", and collectively, the "Sales Agents"), which replaced the prior Sales Agreement with substantially similar terms. Under the terms of the 2021 Sales Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of its Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 400.0 million

 through the Sales Agents as either agents or principals. Sales of the Class A common stock, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at-the-market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Global Select Market and any other existing trading market for the Class A common stock, or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Class A common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the 2021 Sales Agreement. The Company intends to use the net proceeds, if any, from the sale of the Class A common stock pursuant to the 2021 Sales Agreement for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment, refinancing, redemption or repurchase of existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition of outdoor advertising assets and businesses and other related investments. The Company did not issue any shares under this program from its inception through December 31, 2022. 
 Shelf Registration Statement . On June 21, 2021, the Company filed a new automatically effective shelf registration statement (No. 333-257243) that allows Lamar Advertising to offer and sell an indeterminate amount of additional shares of its Class A common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not issue any shares under the shelf registration statement. 
 Credit Facilities. On February 6, 2020, Lamar Media entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of Lamar Media s subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, under which the parties agreed to amend and restate Lamar Media s existing senior credit facility. The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017. 
 On July 2, 2021, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment"), to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment amends the definition of "Subsidiary" to exclude each of Lamar Partnering Sponsor LLC and Lamar Partnering Corporation and any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the "Lamar Partnering Entities") such that, after the giving effect to the Amendment, none of the Lamar Partnering Entities are subject to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement covenants and reporting requirements, but any investment by Lamar Media in any of the Lamar Partnering Entities would be subject to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement covenants. The Amendment also amends the definition of "EBITDA" to replace the existing calculation with a net income-based calculation, which excludes the income of non-Subsidiary entities such as the Lamar Partnering Entities, except to the extent that income of such entities is received by Lamar Media in the form of dividends or distributions. 
 The senior credit facility, as established by the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the senior credit facility ), consists of (i) a 750.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which will mature on February 6, 2025 (the revolving credit facility ), (ii) a 600.0 million Term B loan facility (the Term B loans which will mature on February 6, 2027, and (iii) an incremental facility (the Incremental Facility pursuant to which Lamar Media may incur additional term loan tranches or increase its revolving credit facility subject to a pro forma secured debt ratio calculated as described under Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility of 4.50 to 1.00, as well as certain other conditions, including lender approval. Lamar Media borrowed all 600.0 million in Term B loans on February 6, 2020. The entire amount of the Term B loans will be payable at maturity. 
 The Term B loans bear interest at rates based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate Eurodollar term loans or the Adjusted Base Rate Base Rate term loans ), at Lamar Media s option. Eurodollar term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.50 . Base Rate term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.50 . The revolving credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Adjusted LIBO Rate Eurodollar revolving loans or the Adjusted Base Rate Base Rate revolving loans ), at Lamar Media s option. Eurodollar revolving loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.50 (or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 1.25 at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1). Base Rate revolving loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.50 (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.25 at any time the total debt ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1). The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term B loans and revolving credit facility. 
 On July 29, 2022, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment No. 2") to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The Amendment No. 2 establishes a new 350.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan A loan (the "Term A loans") as a new class of incremental term loans. The Term A loans will mature on February 6, 2025 and bear interest at Term SOFR plus 1.25 and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 . The covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A loans. Lamar Media borrowed all 350.0 million in Term A loans

 on July 29, 2022. Proceeds from the Term A loans were used to repay outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility and a portion of the outstanding balance on our Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior credit facility was 995.0 million, consisting of 600.0 million in Term B loans aggregate principal balance, 350.0 million in Term A loans aggregate principal balance and 45.0 million outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Lamar Media had approximately 694.0 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
 Note Offerings. On January 22, 2021, Lamar Media issued, through an institutional private placement, 550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3 5/8 Senior Notes due 2031 (the 3 5/8 Senior Notes ). The issuance of the 3 5/8 Senior Notes resulted in net proceeds to Lamar Media of approximately 542.5 million. Lamar Media used the proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, to redeem all of its outstanding 650.0 million aggregate principal amount 5 3/4 Senior Notes due 2026. See Uses of Cash-Note Redemption for more information. 
 Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity 
 Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting internally generated cash flow are general economic conditions, specific economic conditions in the markets where the Company conducts its business and overall spending on advertising by advertisers. We expect to generate cash flows from operations during 2023 in excess of our cash needs for operations, capital expenditures and dividends, as described herein. 
 Credit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. The Company and Lamar Media must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the senior credit facility, its outstanding debt securities and its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Restrictions under Debt Securities. As of December 31, 2022, Lamar Media has outstanding all of the 3 3/4 Senior Notes, the 4 Senior Notes, the 4 7/8 Senior Notes and the 3 5/8 Senior Notes. 
 The indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit the incurrence of indebtedness (including indebtedness under the senior credit facility), (i) if no default or event of default would result from such incurrence and (ii) if after giving effect to any such incurrence, the leverage ratio (defined as the sum of (x) total consolidated debt plus (y) the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock of Lamar Media s restricted subsidiaries to trailing four fiscal quarter EBITDA (as defined in the indentures)) would be less than 7.0 to 1.0. Currently, Lamar Media is not in default under the indentures of any of its outstanding notes and, therefore, would be permitted to incur additional indebtedness subject to the foregoing provision. 
 In addition to debt incurred under the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes permit Lamar Media to incur indebtedness pursuant to the following baskets: 
 up to 2.0 billion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility; 
 indebtedness outstanding on the date of the indentures or debt incurred to refinance outstanding debt; 
 inter-company debt between Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries or between restricted subsidiaries; 
 certain purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations to acquire or lease property in the ordinary course of business that cannot exceed the greater of 50.0 million or 5 of Lamar Media s net tangible assets; 
 additional debt not to exceed 75.0 million; and 
 up to 500.0 million of permitted securitization financings. 
 Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility. Lamar Media is required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions under the senior credit facility. If the Company or Lamar Media fails to comply with these tests, the lenders under the senior credit facility will be entitled to exercise certain remedies, including the termination of the lending commitments and the acceleration of the debt payments under the senior credit facility. At December 31, 2022 we were, and currently, we are in compliance with all such tests under the senior credit facility. 
 Lamar Media must maintain a secured debt ratio, defined as total consolidated secured debt of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (including capital lease obligations), minus the lesser of (x) 150.0 million and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 subsidiaries (other than the Special Purpose Subsidiaries (as defined above under Sources of Cash-Accounts Receivable Securitization Program )) to EBITDA, as defined below, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0. 
 Lamar Media is restricted from incurring additional indebtedness subject to exceptions, one of which is that it may incur additional indebtedness not exceeding the greater of 250.0 million or 6 of its total assets. 
 Lamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional unsecured senior indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, Lamar Media would have a total debt ratio, defined as (x) total consolidated debt (including subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) 150.0 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (other than the Special Purpose Subsidiaries) to (y) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended, of less than 7.0 to 1.0. 
 Lamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional subordinated indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its total debt ratio is less than 7.0 to 1.0. 
 Under the senior credit facility, as amended, EBITDA means, for any period, net income, plus (a) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period, the sum determined without duplication and in accordance with GAAP, of (i) taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) any other non-cash income or charges accrued for such period, (vi) charges and expenses in connection with the senior credit facility, any actual or proposed acquisition, disposition or investment (excluding, in each case, purchases and sales of advertising space and operating assets in the ordinary course of business) and any actual or proposed offering of securities, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness (or amendment to any agreement relating to indebtedness), including any refinancing thereof, or recapitalization, (vii) any loss or gain relating to amounts paid or earned in cash prior to the stated settlement date of any swap agreement that has been reflected in operating income for such period), and (viii) any loss on sales of receivables and related assets to a securitization entity in connection with a permitted securitization financing, plus (b) the amount of cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies projected by Lamar Media in good faith to be realized as a result of any acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition within 18 months of any such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such action; provided, (A) the aggregate amount for all such cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies will not exceed an amount equal to 15 of EBITDA for the applicable four quarter period and (B) any such adjustment to EBITDA pursuant to this clause (b) may only take into account cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies that are (I) directly attributable to such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, (II) expected to have a continuing impact on Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries and (III) factually supportable, in each case all as certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Lamar Media) on behalf of Lamar Media, minus (c) to the extent included in net income for such period (determined without duplication and in accordance with GAAP) (i) any extraordinary and unusual gains or losses during such period, and (ii) the proceeds of any casualty events and dispositions. For purposes of this EBITDA definition, the effect thereon of any adjustments required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R shall be excluded. If during any period for which EBITDA is being determined, Lamar Media has consummated any acquisition or disposition, EBITDA will be determined on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition or disposition had been made or consummated on the first day of such period. 
 Under the senior credit facility, "net income" means for any period, the consolidated net income (or loss) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media, and its restricted subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided that the following is excluded from net income: (a) the income (or deficit) of any person accrued prior to the date it becomes a restricted subsidiary or is merged into or consolidated with Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any of its restricted subsidiaries, and (b) the income (or deficit) of any person (other than any of our restricted subsidiaries) in which Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any of its subsidiaries has an ownership interest, except to the extent that any such income is received by Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any of its restricted subsidiaries in the form of dividends or similar distributions. 
 The Company believes that its current level of cash on hand, availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs for the next twelve months. All debt obligations are reflected on the Company s balance sheet. 
 Restrictions under Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. The agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and termination

 event provisions, including but not limited to those providing for the acceleration of amounts owed under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program if, among other things, the Special Purpose Subsidiaries fail to make payments when due, Lamar Media, the Subsidiary Originators or the Special Purpose Subsidiaries become insolvent or subject to bankruptcy proceedings or certain judicial judgments, breach certain representations and warranties or covenants or default under other material indebtedness, a change of control occurs, or if Lamar Media fails to maintain the maximum secured debt ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 required under the senior credit facility. 
 Uses of Cash 
 Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately 167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our capital expenditures are categorized as growth or maintenance as described below. 
 Growth capital expenditures include discretionary capital expenditures incurred primarily for the expansion or development of new advertising markets and construction of new advertising sites. Growth capital expenditures also include certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale for future customer demand of our outdoor advertising services, and other capital projects. 
 Maintenance capital expenditures include capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as growth capital expenditures, including costs incurred to enhance existing advertising sites, general asset improvements, and ordinary corporate capital expenditures. 
 We anticipate our 2023 total capital expenditures will be approximately 185 million. 
 Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed 73 acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately 479.8 million. The acquisitions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2022 were financed using available cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility and borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 On May 4, 2022, the Company acquired Burkhart Advertising Inc. which included more than 1,500 billboard structures and 3,200 billboard faces, including 23 digital displays. On December 9, 2022, the Company acquired assets from Fairway Outdoor and Standard Outdoor which included approximately 1,600 billboard structures and 3,600 billboard displays. These acquisitions were funded with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Investments. On July 12, 2021, Lamar acquired a minority stake in Vistar Media ("Vistar"), a leading global provider of programmatic technology for the digital out-of-home sector. Management believes that Lamar's investment of 30.0 million will help Vistar strengthen its balance sheet, expand its research and development and extend its reach into new markets. Lamar received a seat on Vistar's Board of Directors. 
 Note Redemption. On February 3, 2021, the Company redeemed in full all 650.0 million aggregate principal amount 5 3/4 Senior Notes due 2026. The 5 3/4 Senior Notes redemption was completed using the proceeds received from the 3 5/8 Senior Notes offering completed on January 22, 2021, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 102.875 of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the redemption date. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of 21.6 million related to the note redemption. See Sources of Cash- Note Offerings for more information. 
 Dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared and paid distributions of 508.2 million, or 5.00 per share of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company declared and paid distributions of 404.8 million, or 4.00 per share of common stock. On February 23, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved a dividend of 1.25 per common share to be paid on March 31, 2023. Subject to the approval of the Company s Board of Directors, the Company expects aggregate quarterly distributions to stockholders in 2023 will be 5.00 per common share, including the dividend payable on March 31, 2023. 
 As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company s control, including financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Company s ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, the Company s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to

Table of Contents 

 fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs, the impact of general economic conditions on the Company's operations and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. The foregoing factors may also impact management's recommendations to the Board of Directors as to the timing, amount and frequency of future distributions. 
 Special Purpose Acquisition Company. On April 6, 2021, Lamar Partnering Corporation ("LPC"), a newly formed special purpose acquisition company and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). On June 21, 2022, LPC filed its request to withdraw its registration statement with the SEC. In conjunction with the withdrawn offering, the Company incurred a transaction expense of 1.2 million for the write-off of deferred offering costs incurred on behalf of LPC's registration statement. The 1.2 million in expenses are included in Corporate expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income at December 31, 2022. 
 Stock and Debt Repurchasing Program. On March 16, 2020, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250.0 million of the Company's Class A common stock. Additionally, the Board of Directors has authorized Lamar Media to repurchase up to 250.0 million in outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the senior credit facility. On September 20, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the extension of the repurchase program through March 31, 2023. There were no repurchases under the program as of December 31, 2022. On February 23, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the renewal of the repurchase program through September 30, 2024. The Company's management may opt not to make any repurchases under the program, or may make aggregate purchases less than the total amount authorized. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and thereafter are comprised of contractual obligations, required annual distributions and other opportunistic expenditures. 
 Debt and Contractual Obligations. The following table summarizes our future debt maturities, interest payment obligations, and contractual obligations including required payments under operating and financing leases as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): 
 2023 
 Thereafter Debt maturities (1) 
 249.8 3,063.0 Interest obligations on long-term debt (2) 
 155.0 620.9 Contractual obligations, including operating and financing leases 285.9 1,624.3 Total payments due 690.7 5,308.2 
 (1) Debt maturities assume there is no refinancing prior to the existing maturity date. 
 (2) Interest rates on our variable rate instruments assume rates at the December 2022 levels. See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for further discussion on interest rate risk. 
 Required Annual Distributions. As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). On February 23, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved a dividend of 1.25 per common share to be paid on March 31, 2023. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate future dividends in order to continue to satisfy the requirements needed to maintain our REIT status. 
 Opportunistic Expenditures. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. We will continue to reinvest in our existing assets and expand our outdoor advertising display portfolio through new construction. We will also continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising businesses and assets. This includes acquisitions in our existing markets and in new markets where we can meet our return on investment criteria. 
 Cash Flows 
 The Company s cash flows provided by operating activities increased 47.2 million from 734.4 million in 2021 to 781.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily resulting from an increase in revenues of approximately 244.7 million offset by an increase in operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation, gain on disposition of assets and depreciation and amortization) of approximately 137.6 million, as well as increases in interest expense of 21.1 million and income tax expense and 8.2 million as compared to the comparable period in 2021. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Cash flows used in investing activities increased 157.3 million from 461.8 million in 2021 to 619.1 million in 2022 primarily due to a net increase in the amount of assets acquired through acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures of 178.5 million, offset by decreases in notes receivable, as compared to the same period in 2021. 
 The Company s cash flows used in financing activities were 209.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 294.5 million in 2021. This decrease in cash used in financing activities of 85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to increased borrowings on the senior credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program in 2022, offset by an increase in cash paid for dividends and distributions in 2022 over the comparable period in 2021. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets, goodwill impairment and asset retirement obligations. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events and, where applicable, established valuation techniques. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations. The Company had an asset retirement obligation of 390.4 million as of December 31, 2022. This liability relates to the Company s obligation upon the termination or non-renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to restore the site to its original condition. The Company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred. The liability is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset s carrying amount. Over time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. In calculating the liability, the Company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle, adjusted for inflation and market risk. 
 This calculation includes 100 of the Company s billboard structures on leased land (which currently consist of approximately 72,500 structures). The Company uses a 15-year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets, including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets, which includes the initial term of the lease, plus consideration of any renewal period. Historical third-party cost information is used to estimate the cost of dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on the Company s historical credit-adjusted risk free rate. 
 Acquisitions. The Company accounts for transactions that meet the definition of a business and group asset purchases as acquisitions. For transactions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company allocates the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For transactions that meet the definition of a business, the determination of the final purchase price and the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized in the prior period financial statements. For transactions that meet the definition of asset group purchases, the Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated relative fair values as of the date of the acquisition. If a transaction is determined to be a group of assets, any direct acquisition costs are capitalized. Transaction costs for transactions determined to be a business combination are expensed as incurred. 
 The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset, adjusted for an estimated reduction in fair value due to age of the asset, and the economic useful life. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows. 
 Lease Liabilities and Right of Use Assets. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Codified as ASC 842), which resulted in recording operating lease liabilities and right of use assets on our consolidated 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 balance sheet. Our operating lease liabilities (including short-term liabilities) and right of use asset balances were 1.24 billion and 1.27 billion as of December 31, 2022, respectively. The balance is recorded based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under the leasing standard for our existing operating leases. The key estimates for our leases include (1) the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and (2) lease term. Our leases generally do not include a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore, using a portfolio approach, we determine our collateralized incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on the information available at lease commencement. Our lease terms include the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend the lease controlled by the lessor. The Company has determined we are not reasonably certain to exercise renewals or termination options, and as a result we use the lease s initial stated term as the lease term for our lease population. 
 
 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATORY UPDATE 
 See Note 21, "New Accounting Pronouncements" to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our Accounting Standards and Regulatory Update. 
 
 LAMAR MEDIA CORP. 
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Lamar Media for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Media and the related notes. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net revenues 100.0 100.0 Operating expenses: Direct advertising expenses 32.8 32.3 General and administrative expenses 17.3 18.3 Corporate expenses 5.0 5.2 Depreciation and amortization 17.2 15.2 Operating income 28.5 29.2 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1.2 Interest expense 6.3 6.0 Income tax expense 0.9 0.5 Net income 21.6 21.8 
 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year ended December 31, 2021 
 Net revenues increased 244.7 million or 13.7 to 2.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.79 billion for the same period in 2021. This increase was attributable to an increase in billboard net revenues of 200.4 million, an increase in transit net revenues of 42.3 million and an increase in logo net revenues of 2.0 million over the prior year. 
 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2021, increased 180.6 million, or 9.8 . The 180.6 million increase in net revenues is due to a 142.5 million increase in billboard net revenues, a 36.3 million increase in transit net revenues and an increase of 1.8 million in logo net revenues. See Reconciliations below. 
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of assets, increased 123.7 million, or 12.4 to 1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 996.2 million in the same period in 2021. The 123.7 million increase over the prior year is primarily comprised of an increase in total direct, general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and transaction expenses) of 134.2 million primarily related to an increase in our variable billboard lease costs and transit and airport franchise costs, as well as increases in our workforce. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 78.2 million to 349.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 271.3 million for the same period in 2021. The increase is due to the revision in the cost estimate included in the calculation of asset retirement obligations during 2022, as well as acquisitions and capital expenditures that occurred in the second half of 2021 and during 2022. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, Lamar Media recognized a gain on disposition of assets of 15.7 million as compared to a gain on disposition of assets of 2.1 million for the same period in 2021. The gain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from a gain of 12.6 million from a contingent payment received in connection with the Company's 2018 sale of Puerto Rico assets. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased 56.5 million to 578.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 522.0 million for the same period in 2021. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, Lamar Media recorded a 21.6 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of its 5 3/4 Senior Notes. There was no loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Interest expense increased 21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 127.5 million as compared to 106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the increase in interest rates on the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program and senior credit facility. 
 Equity in earnings of investee was 4.3 million and 3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of an investment that occurred in July of 2021. 
 The increase in operating income and the decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2021, resulted in a 58.4 million increase in net income before income taxes. 
 Lamar Media recorded income tax expense of 17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to an income tax expense of 9.3 million for the same period in 2021. The 17.5 million tax expense includes an expense of 15.2 million for the reduction of Puerto Rico deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 17.5 million equates to an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 3.8 , which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items. 
 As a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 439.1 million, as compared to net income of 388.9 million for the same period in 2021. 
 Reconciliations: 
 Because acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2020 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2021 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2021 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Reconciliations of 2021 reported net revenue to 2021 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 as well as a comparison of 2021 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2022 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, are provided below:

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Lamar Advertising Company and Lamar Media Corp. 
 Lamar Advertising Company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with variable rate debt instruments issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Lamar Media Corp. The information below summarizes the Company s interest rate risk associated with its principal variable rate debt instruments outstanding at December 31, 2022, and should be read in conjunction with Note 9 of the Notes to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Lamar Media Corp. has variable rate debt outstanding under the senior credit facility and its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Because interest rates may increase or decrease at any time, the Company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the applicable borrowings outstanding. Increases in the interest rates applicable to these borrowings would result in increased interest expense and a reduction in the Company s net income. 
 At December 31, 2022 there was approximately 1.24 billion of indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, or approximately 37.2 of the Company s outstanding long-term debt (including current maturities) on that date, bearing interest at variable rates. The aggregate interest expense for 2022 with respect to borrowings under the senior credit facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was 35.7 million, and the weighted average interest rate applicable to these borrowings during 2022 was 3.1 . Assuming that the weighted average interest rate was 200 basis points higher (that is 5.1 rather than 3.1 ), then the Company s 2022 interest expense would have increased by approximately 21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The Company attempts to mitigate the interest rate risk resulting from its variable interest rate long-term debt instruments by issuing fixed rate long-term debt instruments and maintaining a balance over time between the amount of the Company s variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness. In addition, the Company has the capability under the senior credit facility to fix the interest rates applicable to its borrowings at an amount equal to Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as applicable), or Adjusted Base Rate plus the applicable margin for periods of up to twelve months (in certain cases with the consent of the lenders), which would allow the Company to mitigate the impact of short-term fluctuations in market interest rates. In the event of an increase in interest rates, the Company may take further actions to mitigate its exposure. The Company cannot guarantee, however, that the actions that it may take to mitigate this risk will be feasible or that, if these actions are taken, that they will be effective.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Lamar Advertising Company: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Lamar Advertising Company and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II to III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion . 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements . 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Lamar Advertising Company: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lamar Advertising Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II to III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of the accounting lease term for the portfolio of billboard land leases 
 As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, a lessee determines the lease term at the commencement date by identifying the non-cancellable period of the lease and then adding any periods for which it is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option (or not to exercise a termination option). The Company has approximately 72,500 billboard land leases for which they determined the lease term using a portfolio approach, in accordance with which the negotiated stated initial lease term for each billboard land lease was concluded to be the lease term under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842). 
 
 We identified the assessment of the lease term for the portfolio of billboard land leases, which affects the discount rate for the lease as well as the measurement of the lease liability and right of use asset, as a critical audit matter. In the Company s billboard land leases, the Company typically has both unilateral renewal and termination options. Determining the lease term involved a high degree of subjectivity as to whether the lease term should or should not include renewal periods (including periods after an optional termination date), the evaluation of which required subjective auditor judgment. 
 
 47 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s billboard land lease process, including controls over the qualifications and experience of individuals negotiating the stated initial lease term, reconciliation of inputs into the system, approval of billboard land lease contracts, and annual evaluation of the renewals and terminations exercised by the Company during the year. We evaluated the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of the Company s real estate team that negotiates the lease terms and conditions, and whether the team considers economic factors that are consistent with those enumerated in ASC 842 when negotiating the stated initial lease term and associated renewal and termination options. We inspected the Company s assessment and conclusion about using the portfolio approach for its billboard land leases. We tested a sample of the Company s billboard land lease population and obtained underlying documentation to evaluate whether the leases entered into are similar in terms of the lease agreement creation process, purpose for the lease (i.e. to host a Company billboard), and lease term considerations. We assessed the impact of billboard land leases with early terminations and renewals beyond the stated initial term to evaluate the Company s assertion that use of the stated initial lease term as the lease term for its billboard land leases on a portfolio basis was appropriate.

 billboard advertising displays in states and Canada. The Company s operating strategy is to be the leading provider of outdoor advertising services in the markets it serves. 
 In addition, the Company operates a logo sign business in states throughout the United States and the province of Ontario, Canada and operates approximately transit advertising displays in states and Canada. Logo signs are erected pursuant to state-awarded service contracts on public rights-of-way near highway exits and deliver brand name information on available gas, food, lodging and camping services. Included in the Company s logo sign business are tourism signing contracts. The Company provides transit advertising in airport terminals, on bus shelters, benches and buses in the markets it serves. 
 The Company operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on its income and gains that the Company distributes to its stockholders, including the income derived from advertising rental revenue. However, even as a REIT, the Company will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from the assets of its taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs ). In addition, the Company s foreign assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. 
 On July 1, 2022, the Company's direct wholly owned subsidiary Lamar Media Corp. ("Lamar Media") entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the "Partnership Agreement") of Lamar Advertising Limited Partnership (the "OP") as the initial limited partner, along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Advertising General Partner, LLC, as the general partner of the OP (the "General Partner"). Lamar Media formed the OP and contributed all of its assets to the OP in connection with the Company's reorganization (the "Reorganization") as a specific type of REIT known as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust ("UPREIT"). The Company completed the Reorganization to facilitate tax-deferred contributions of properties to the OP in exchange for limited partnership interests in the OP. The Reorganization did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 reporting units, Billboard operations and Logo operations, by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units. The Company is required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. To the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company would be required to book an impairment loss. 
 The Company conducts a qualitative assessment by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on the Company s goodwill, which includes macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, reporting unit dispositions and acquisitions, the market capitalization of the Company and other relevant events specific to the Company. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances described above, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of either of the Company's reporting units is less than its carrying amount, the Company will perform a quantitative impairment test. If industry and economic conditions deteriorate, the Company may be required to assess goodwill impairment before the next annual test, which could result in impairment charges. 
 The Company performed its annual measurement for impairment of the goodwill of its reporting units and concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount at its annual impairment test date on December 31, 2022 and 2021; therefore, the Company was not required to recognize an impairment loss. 
 Intangible assets, consisting primarily of site locations, customer lists and contracts, and non-competition agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives, generally from to years.

Revenue for production contracts are recognized under ASC 606. Contract revenues for production services are recognized upon satisfaction of the contract which is typically less than one week. 
 Arrangements with multiple performance obligations: Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers using expected cost plus margin. 
 Deferred revenues: We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance obligation. The term between invoicing and when a payment is due is not significant. For certain services we require payment before the product or services are delivered to the customer. The balance of deferred income is considered short-term and will be recognized in revenue within twelve months. 
 Practical expedients and exemptions: The Company is utilizing the following practical expedients and exemptions from ASC 606. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within direct advertising expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations as the majority of our contracts with customers have an original expected length of less than one year. For contracts with customers which exceed one year, the future amount to be invoiced to the customer corresponds directly with the value to be received by the customer.

 Receivable Financing Agreement (the "Receivable Financing Agreement") with its wholly-owned special purpose entities, Lamar QRS Receivables, LLC and Lamar TRS Receivables, LLC (the Special Purpose Subsidiaries (the "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program"). The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is limited to the availability of eligible accounts receivable collateralizing the borrowings under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Pursuant to two separate Purchase and Sale Agreements dated December 18, 2018, each of which is among Lamar Media as initial Servicer, certain of Lamar Media s subsidiaries and a Special Purpose Subsidiary, the subsidiaries sold substantially all of their existing and future accounts receivable balances to the Special Purpose Subsidiaries. The Special Purpose Subsidiaries use the accounts receivable balances to collateralize loans pursuant to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Lamar Media retains the responsibility of servicing the accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program and provides a performance guaranty. 
 On June 24, 2022, Lamar Media and the Special Purpose Subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment (the "Sixth Amendment") to the Receivables Financing Agreement. The Sixth Amendment increased the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program from to and extended the maturity date of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program to July 21, 2025. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR-based interest rate mechanics with Term SOFR based interest rate mechanics for the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there was outstanding aggregate borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Lamar Media had additional availability for borrowing under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program as of December 31, 2022. The commitment fees based on the amount of unused commitments under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program were immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program will mature on July 21, 2025. Lamar Media may amend the facility to extend the maturity date, enter into a new securitization facility with a different maturity date, or refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program using borrowings under its senior credit facility or from other financing sources. 
 The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is accounted for as a collateralized financing activity, rather than a sale of assets, and therefore: (i) accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral are presented as assets and the borrowings are presented as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, (ii) our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income reflect the associated charges for bad debt expense (a component of general and administrative expenses) related to the pledged accounts receivable and interest expense associated with the collateralized borrowings and (iii) receipts from customers related to the underlying accounts receivable are reflected as operating cash flows and borrowings and repayments under the collateralized loans are reflected as financing cash flows within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the carry forwards governed by the tax code. Based on the current level of pretax earnings, the Company will not generate the minimum

 million shares of Class A common stock for issuance to directors and employees, including shares underlying granted options and common stock reserved for issuance under its performance-based incentive program. Options granted under the 1996 Plan expire from the grant date with vesting terms ranging from three to which primarily includes 1) options that vest in one-fifth increments beginning on the grant date and continuing on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date and 2) options that cliff-vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. All grants are made at fair market value based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. 
 In February 2013, the 1996 Plan was amended to eliminate the provision that limited the amount of Class A common stock, including shares retained from an award, that could be withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations to the minimum tax obligations required by law (except with respect to option awards). In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , the Company is required to classify the awards affected by the amendment as liability-classified awards at fair value each period prior to their settlement. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a liability, in accrued expenses, of and , respectively, related to its equity incentive awards affected by this amendment. 
 We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model incorporates various highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility. We have reviewed our historical pattern of option exercises and have determined that meaningful differences in option exercise activity existed among vesting schedules. Therefore, for all stock options granted after January 1, 2006, we have categorized these awards into two groups of vesting 1) -year cliff vest and 2) -year graded vest, for valuation purposes. We have determined there were no meaningful differences in employee activity under our ESPP due to the nature of the plan. 
 We estimate the expected term of options granted using an implied life derived from the results of a hypothetical mid-point settlement scenario, which incorporates our historical exercise, expiration and post-vesting employment termination patterns, while accommodating for partial life cycle effects. We believe these estimates will approximate future behavior.

 historical volatility of our Class A common stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options with maturities greater than six months on our Class A common stock as of the option grant date. Our decision to use a blend of historical and implied volatility was based upon the volume of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that historical volatility alone may not be completely representative of future stock price trends. 
 Our risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. We assumed an expected dividend yield of . 
 We estimate option forfeitures at the time of grant and periodically revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We record stock based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture data.

 Performance-based compensation. Unrestricted shares of our Class A common stock may be awarded to key officers, employees and directors under our 1996 Plan based on certain Company performance measures for fiscal year 2022. The number of shares to be issued, if any, are dependent on the level of achievement of these performance measures as determined by the Company s Compensation Committee based on our 2022 results and are issued in the first half of 2023.

 LTIP Units. In addition to performance-based compensation, the Company may issue LTIP Units of the OP, a subsidiary of the Company, to certain officers, employees and directors under the 1996 Plan.

LTIP Units are a class of units intended to qualify as "profits interests" of the OP. The LTIP Units convert into Common Units of the OP upon the occurrence of certain events. Common Units are redeemable by the holder for shares of the Company's Class A common stock after a holding period of twelve months, or may be paid out in cash at the option of the general partner of the OP. On July 1, 2022, the OP issued a total of LTIP Units to the Company's executive officers.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholder and Board of Directors 
 Lamar Media Corp.: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Lamar Media Corp. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II to III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lamar Media Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II to III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of the accounting lease term for the portfolio of billboard land leases 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which refers to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Advertising Company, a lessee determines the lease term at the commencement date by identifying the non-cancellable period of the lease and then adding any periods for which it is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option (or not to exercise a termination option). The Company has approximately 72,500 billboard land leases for which they determined the lease term using a portfolio approach, in accordance with which the negotiated stated initial lease term for each billboard land lease was concluded to be the lease term under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842). 
 
 We identified the assessment of the lease term for the portfolio of billboard land leases, which affects the discount rate for the lease as well as the measurement of the lease liability and right of use asset, as a critical audit matter. In the Company s billboard land leases, the Company typically has both unilateral renewal and termination options. Determining the lease term involved a high degree of subjectivity as to whether the lease term should or should not include renewal periods (including periods after an optional termination date), the evaluation of which required subjective auditor judgment.

Table of Contents 

 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s billboard land lease process, including controls over the qualifications and experience of individuals negotiating the stated initial lease term, reconciliation of inputs into the system, approval of billboard land lease contracts, and annual evaluation of the renewals and terminations exercised by the Company during the year. We evaluated the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of the Company s real estate team that negotiates the lease terms and conditions, and whether the team considers economic factors that are consistent with those enumerated in ASC 842 when negotiating the stated initial lease term and associated renewal and termination options. We inspected the Company s assessment and conclusion about using the portfolio approach for its billboard land leases. We tested a sample of the Company s billboard land lease population and obtained underlying documentation to evaluate whether the leases entered into are similar in terms of the lease agreement creation process, purpose for the lease (i.e. to host a Company billboard), and lease term considerations. We assessed the impact of billboard land leases with early terminations and renewals beyond the stated initial term to evaluate the Company s assertion that use of the stated initial lease term as the lease term for its billboard land leases on a portfolio basis was appropriate.

 Exhibit 14(a) 

 LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY 
 CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 
 This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code sets forth legal and ethical standards of conduct for directors, officers and employees of Lamar Advertising Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ). This Code is intended to deter wrongdoing and to promote the conduct of all Company business in accordance with high standards of integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 If you have any questions regarding this Code or its application to you in any situation, you should contact your supervisor or the Vice President of Human Resources. 
 Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations 
 The Company requires that all employees, officers and directors comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company wherever it does business. You are expected to use good judgment and common sense in seeking to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to ask for advice when you are uncertain about them. 
 If you become aware of the violation of any law, rule or regulation by the Company, whether by its officers, employees or directors, it is your responsibility to promptly report the matter as outlined under the heading Reporting and Compliance Procedures below. While it is the Company s desire to address matters internally, nothing in this Code should discourage you from reporting any illegal activity, including any violation of the securities laws, antitrust laws, environmental laws or any other federal, state or foreign law, rule or regulation to the appropriate federal or state regulatory authority. Employees, officers and directors shall not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any other manner discriminate against an employee because he or she in good faith reports any such violation. This Code should not be construed to prohibit you from testifying, participating or otherwise assisting in any state or federal administrative, judicial or legislative proceeding or investigation. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Employees, officers and directors must act in the best interests of the Company. Personal interests must not interfere with or otherwise be harmful to the interests of the Company. Any actual or apparent conflict of interest between personal interests and those of the Company must be handled honestly and ethically in accordance with the following procedures. Any conflict of interest is prohibited unless it has gone through the process of disclosure, consultation and approval set forth below. 
 Full disclosure of any actual or apparent conflict is the essential first step to remaining in full compliance with this policy. You must disclose all actual and apparent conflicts of interest, including any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest, to your Regional Manager or, in the event that such individual is involved in the matter, to the Vice President of Human Resources. Executive officers and directors must disclose such matters to the Chair of the Audit Committee or to the member of such committee charged with reviewing conflicts of interest. 
 The Board of Directors has adopted rules for what activities constitute conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest, as well as procedures for determining whether a relation or transaction constitutes a conflict of interest, which it will review and, if appropriate, 

update from time to time. The current version of these rules and procedures are attached as Appendices A and B to this Code. 
 Following disclosure, any employee, officer or director must avoid or terminate any activity that involves an actual or reasonably apparent conflict of interest unless it is determined at the appropriate level that the activity is not a conflict of interest or is otherwise not harmful to the Company or improper. Any such determination shall be made by the disinterested members of the Audit Committee in the case of an executive officer or director and as set forth below for any employee. 
 Any employee who has a question about whether any situation in which he or she is involved amounts to a conflict of interest or the appearance of one should disclose the pertinent details, preferably in writing, to his or her supervisor. Each supervisor is responsible for discussing the situation with the employee and arriving at a decision after consultation with or notice to the appropriate higher level of management. 
 No director, director nominee, executive officer or greater than 5 shareholder may enter into any transaction or relationship that is disclosable by the Company pursuant to SEC Reg. S-K, Item 404 without the prior approval of the Audit Committee. 
 Insider Trading 
 Employees, officers and directors who have material non-public information about the Company or other companies, including our suppliers and customers, as a result of their relationship with the Company are prohibited by law and Company policy from trading in securities of the Company or such other companies, as well as from communicating such information to others who might trade on the basis of that information. To help ensure that you do not engage in prohibited insider trading and avoid even the appearance of an improper transaction, the Company has adopted a Policy on Securities Trading and Inside Information, which is available in the Human Resources section of the Company s Intranet. 
 If you are uncertain about the legal constraints on your purchase or sale of any Company securities or the securities of any other company that you are familiar with by virtue of your relationship with the Company, you should refer to the Company s Policy on Securities Trading and Inside Information and follow the procedures set forth in that policy before making any such purchase or sale. 
 Confidentiality 
 Employees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or other companies, including its suppliers and customers, except when disclosure is authorized by a supervisor or legally mandated. Unauthorized disclosure of any confidential information is prohibited. Additionally, employees should take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive business information, whether it is proprietary to the Company or another company, is not communicated within the Company except to employees who have a need to know such information to perform their responsibilities for the Company. 
 Third parties may ask you for information concerning the Company. Employees, officers and directors (other than the authorized spokespersons referred to below) should not discuss internal Company matters with, or disseminate internal Company information to, anyone outside the Company, except as required in the performance of their Company duties and after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is in place. If you receive any inquiries of this nature, you must decline to comment and refer the inquirer to your supervisor or one of the authorized 
 - 2 - 

spokespersons. The Company s policies with respect to public disclosure of internal matters are described more fully in the Company s Disclosure Policy and Practices, a copy of which is available from the Company s Human Resources Department upon request. 
 You also must abide by any lawful obligations that you have to your former employer. These obligations may include restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential information, restrictions on the solicitation of former colleagues to work at the Company and non-competition obligations. 
 Honest and Ethical Conduct and Fair Dealing 
 Each employee, officer and director should endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company s suppliers, customers, competitors and employees. Statements regarding the Company s products and services should not be untrue, misleading, deceptive or fraudulent. You should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice. 
 Protection and Proper Use of Corporate Assets 
 All employees, officers and directors should seek to protect the Company s assets. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company s financial performance. Employees, officers and directors should use the Company s assets and services solely for legitimate business purposes of the Company and not for any unauthorized use. 
 All employees, officers and directors should advance the Company s legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. You should not take for yourself personal opportunities that are discovered through your position with the Company or the use of property or information of the Company. 
 Gifts and Gratuities 
 The use of Company funds or assets for gifts to or entertainment of government officials or employees is prohibited, except to the extent such gifts or entertainment are in compliance with applicable law, nominal in amount (not to exceed 100 in value or such lesser amount as permitted under applicable law), and not given in consideration or expectation of any action by the recipient. 
 Employees, officers and directors must not accept, or permit any close relative to accept, any gifts, gratuities or other favors from any customers, suppliers or others doing or seeking to do business with the Company, other than items of nominal value. Any gifts that are not of nominal value should be returned immediately and reported to your supervisor. If immediate return is not practical, they should be given to the Company for charitable disposition or such other disposition as the Company believes appropriate in its sole discretion. 
 Bribes and kickbacks are criminal acts, strictly prohibited by law. No Company employee may offer, give, solicit or receive any form of bribe or kickback. Bribes shall be interpreted in the broadest sense to include any type of preferential treatment secured by providing, directly or indirectly, an individual or his or her family members or associates with personal gain in relation to business conducted by or on behalf of the Company. 
 - 3 - 

Accuracy of Books and Records and Public Reports 
 Employees, officers and directors must honestly and accurately report all business transactions. You are responsible for the accuracy of your records and reports. Accurate information is essential to the Company s ability to meet legal and regulatory obligations.

The financial statements of the Company shall conform to generally accepted accounting rules and the Company s accounting policies. No undisclosed or unrecorded account or fund shall be established for any purpose. No false or misleading entries shall be made in the Company s books or records for any reason, and no disbursement of corporate funds or other corporate property shall be made without adequate supporting documentation. 
 It is the policy of the Company to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents filed with, or submitted to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications. 
 Waivers of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
 While some of the policies contained in this Code must be strictly adhered to and no exceptions can be allowed, in other cases exceptions may be possible. Any employee or non-executive officer who believes that an exception to any of these policies is appropriate in his or her case should first contact his or her immediate supervisor. If the supervisor agrees that an exception is appropriate, the approval of the Regional Manager must be obtained. Each Regional Manager shall be responsible for maintaining a complete record of all requests for exceptions to any of these policies and the disposition of such requests. 
 Any executive officer or director who seeks an exception to any of these policies should contact the Company s General Counsel. Any waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors or any change to this Code that applies to executive officers or directors may be made only by the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Company and will be disclosed as required by applicable law or stock market regulation.

APPENDIX B 
 Procedures for Determining Conflicts of Interest and Waivers 
 
 In determining whether a conflict of interest exists and whether to waive a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provision in a particular circumstance, the board should also consider 
 the person involved in the potential conflict (For example, whether the person is an executive officer or a director of the Company and, if a director of the Company, whether the person is an independent director. The more peripheral the person s relationship to the Company is, the less likely that person is to influence the Company s day-to-day operations and therefore the less likely the circumstance is to be disadvantageous to the Company) 
 the nature of the relationship or situation creating the potential conflict of interest (For example, does the issue arise because the person serves as an executive officer of the Company and a director of a contracting party with the Company Is the person a director of the Company and an executive officer of a contracting party with the Company Is the person a director of the Company and a director of a contracting party with the Company Or is the director or executive officer of the Company related to a person that is a director or executive officer of the contracting party with the Company The more peripheral the relationship of the person to either of the companies involved, the less likely that person is able to influence either company s day-to-day decisions and therefore the less likely the relationship or activity is to be disadvantageous to the Company) 
 the nature of the company with which the director or executive officer is affiliated (For example, is the company a competitor of the Company or a collaborator or a supplier or customer, and how significant a competitor, collaborator supplier or customer is the company 
 the nature of any proposed transaction , including 
 the size of the transaction, 
 whether the Company has engaged in this type of transaction before, either with this party or others, 
 other connections with the other party, 
 leverage of the other party, 
 whether there were unusual terms associated with the transaction, and 
 whether the terms offered are those that the Board believes would be offered or could be obtained absent the relationship 
 - 9 - 

the level of involvement of the executive officer or director involving questions in any proposed transaction, including whether the waiver candidate will receive any compensation or other benefit tied to the transaction 
 whether the individual usurped a corporate opportunity 
 whether the proposed transaction or relationship would cause a director to lose his status as an independent director and 
 how any related disclosure would appear in, for example, The Wall Street Journal or other public forum. 
 After reviewing these considerations and any others it considers appropriate, the Board should then consider whether the relationship or activity (i) will adversely affect the Company, (ii) was undertaken by the individual in good faith, (iii) constitutes a breach of loyalty to the Company and its stockholders, (iv) constitutes a violation of law, and (v) confers an improper personal benefit on the individual. The Board should then be in a position to determine if a conflict of interest exists and, if so, whether to waive the conflict if the relationship or activity is in the best interests of the Company or not opposed to those interests.
