 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements concerning our operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are developed by combining currently available information with our beliefs and assumptions and are generally identified by the words believe, expect, anticipate and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance, which may be materially different from that expressed in, or implied by, any such statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their respective dates. 
 These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance taking into account all information currently available to us. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us or within our control, and which could materially affect actual results, performance or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding indebtedness; 
 impairment in the value of real estate property securing our loans or in which we invest; 
 availability of mortgage origination and acquisition opportunities acceptable to us; 
 potential mismatches in the timing of asset repayments and the maturity of the associated financing agreements; 
 our ability to achieve the benefits that we anticipate from the prior acquisition of the project finance origination, underwriting and capital markets business of GE Capital Global Holdings, LLC; 
 the duration and extent of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants and resurgences, or any future pandemic or similar outbreak, on the global economy, our operations and financial performance and the operations and financial performance of the borrowers underlying our real estate-related assets and infrastructure loans and tenants of our owned properties; 
 national and local economic and business conditions, including as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 the occurrence of certain geo-political events (such as wars, terrorist attacks and tensions between states) that affect the normal and peaceful course of international relations (such as the war between Russia and Ukraine); 
 general and local commercial and residential real estate property conditions; 
 changes in federal government policies; 
 changes in federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations; 
 increased competition from entities engaged in mortgage lending and securities investing activities; 
 changes in interest rates; and 
 the availability of, and costs associated with, sources of liquidity. 
 In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurances that the results referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K will in fact occur. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, changes to future results over time or otherwise.

 We have four reportable business segments as of December 31, 2022 and we refer to the investments within these segments as our target assets: 
 Real estate commercial and residential lending (the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial first mortgages, non-agency residential mortgages residential loans ), subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ), residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and other real estate and real estate-related debt investments in the U.S., Europe and Australia (including distressed or non-performing loans).

 Investment Strategy 
 We seek to attain attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors over the long term by sourcing and managing a diversified portfolio of target assets, financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. Our investment strategy focuses on a few fundamental themes: 
 origination and acquisition of real estate debt assets with an implied basis sufficiently low to weather declines in asset values; 
 acquisition of equity interests in commercial real estate properties that generate stable current returns, increase the duration of our investment portfolio and provide potential for capital appreciation; 
 focus on real estate markets and asset classes with strong supply and demand fundamentals and/or barriers to entry; 
 structuring and financing each transaction in a manner that reflects the risk of the underlying asset s cash flow stream and credit risk profile, and efficiently managing and maintaining the transaction s interest rate and currency exposures at levels consistent with management s risk objectives; 
 seeking situations where our size, scale, speed and sophistication allow us to position ourselves as a one-stop lending solution for real estate owner/operators; 
 utilizing the skills, expertise, and contacts developed by our Manager over the past 30 years as one of the premier global real estate investment managers to (i) correctly anticipate trends and identify attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities in U.S., European and Australian real estate markets; and (ii) expand and diversify our presence in various asset classes, including: 
 origination and acquisition of residential loans, including non-agency residential loans sometimes referred to as non-qualified mortgages or non-QMs and 
 origination and acquisition of corporate and asset-backed loans; 
 utilizing the skills, expertise and infrastructure we acquired through our 2013 acquisition of LNR Property LLC LNR ), a market leading diversified real estate investment management and loan servicing company comprising our Investing and Servicing Segment, to expand and diversify our presence in various segments of real estate, including: 
 origination of small and medium sized loan transactions 5 million to 50 million) for both investment and securitization/gain-on-sale; 
 investment in CMBS; 
 investment in commercial real estate; 
 special servicing of commercial real estate loans in commercial real estate securitization transactions; and 
 
 utilizing the skills and expertise we acquired through our 2018 acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment from GE Capital Global Holdings, LLC GE Capital to expand our originations and acquisitions of infrastructure debt investments. 
 
 In order to capitalize on the changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle, we may expand or refocus our investment strategy by emphasizing investments in different parts of the capital structure and different sectors of real estate. Our investment strategy may be amended from time to time, if recommended by our Manager and approved by our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders. In addition to our Manager making direct investments on our behalf, we may enter into joint venture, management or other agreements with persons that have special expertise or sourcing capabilities.

 Investment Guidelines 
 Our board of directors has adopted the following investment guidelines: 
 our investments will be in our target assets unless otherwise approved by our board of directors; 
 no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; 
 no investment shall be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be required to be registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act; 
 not more than 25 of our equity will be invested in any individual asset without the consent of a majority of our independent directors; and 
 (a) any investment that is less than 150.0 million will require approval of our Chief Executive Officer; (b) any investment that is equal to or in excess of 150.0 million but less than 250.0 million will require approval of our Manager s investment committee; (c) any investment that is equal to or in excess of 250.0 million but less than 400.0 million will require approval of each of the investment committee of our board of directors and our Manager s investment committee; and (d) any investment that is equal to or in excess of 400.0 million will require approval of each of our board of directors and our Manager s investment committee. 
 
 These investment guidelines may be changed from time to time by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. In addition, both our Manager and our board of directors must approve any change in our investment guidelines that would modify or expand the types of assets in which we invest. 
 Investment Process 
 Our investment process includes sourcing and screening of investment opportunities, assessing investment suitability, conducting interest rate and prepayment analysis, evaluating cash flow and collateral performance, and reviewing legal structure and servicer and originator information and investment structuring, as appropriate, to seek an attractive return commensurate with the risk we are bearing. Upon identification of an investment opportunity, the investment will be screened and monitored by us to determine its impact on maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. We will seek to make investments in sectors where we have strong core competencies and believe market risk and expected performance can be reasonably quantified. 
 We evaluate each one of our investment opportunities based on its expected risk-adjusted return relative to the returns available from other, comparable investments. In addition, we evaluate new opportunities based on their relative expected returns compared to comparable positions held in our portfolio. The terms of any leverage available to us for use in funding an investment purchase are also taken into consideration, as are any risks posed by illiquidity or correlations with other securities in the portfolio. We also develop a macro outlook with respect to each target asset class by examining factors in the broader economy such as gross domestic product, interest rates, unemployment rates and availability of credit, among other things. We also analyze fundamental trends in the relevant target asset class sector to adjust/maintain our outlook for that particular target asset class. 
 Financing Strategy 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registering under the 1940 Act, we may finance the acquisition of our target assets, to the extent available to us, through the following methods: 
 sources of private and government sponsored financing, including long and short-term repurchase agreements, warehouse and bank credit facilities, and mortgage loans on equity interests in commercial real estate properties; 
 
 loan sales, syndications, securitizations and/or collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") transactions; and 
 
 public or private offerings of our equity and/or debt. 
 
 We may also utilize other sources of financing to the extent available to us.

We continually monitor borrower performance and complete a detailed, loan by loan formal credit review on a quarterly basis. The results of this review are incorporated into our quarterly assessment of credit loss allowances. 
 As of December 31, 2022, commercial loans held for investment and HTM securities had a weighted average expected maturity of 1.7 years, inclusive of extension options that management believes are probable of exercise.

 Regulation 
 We have elected, and are organized and conduct our operations, to qualify as a REIT under the Code, as further described below. As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of our net income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements imposed by the Code. We also conduct our business so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. So long as we qualify for an exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we are not be subject to leverage and other restrictions imposed on registered investment companies. 
 Our operations in the U.S., Europe and Australia are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by U.S. and other governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting activities; (2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; (5) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices; and (6) regulate affordable housing rental activities. We are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the Fair Housing Act and U.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations. In addition, we have a subsidiary that is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and, as a result, we are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions that apply to our relationships with that subsidiary s clients. Although many states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders, financiers and servicers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. Further, the assets underlying our infrastructure loans are subject to state and federal laws and regulations applicable to the electric power and oil and gas industries, which laws and regulations govern, among other things, the siting and construction, operation, environmental impacts and revenue streams of such assets. 
 In our judgment, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. In recent years, legislators in the U.S. and other countries have said that greater regulation of financial institutions is needed, particularly in areas such as risk management, leverage and disclosure. While we expect that additional new regulations in these areas will be adopted and existing ones may change in the future, it is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial

 condition or results of operations or prospects. See Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information regarding government regulation. 
 Competition 
 We are engaged in a competitive business. In our investment activities, we compete for opportunities with numerous public and private investment vehicles, including financial institutions, specialty finance companies, mortgage banks, pension funds, opportunity funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, REITs and other institutional investors, as well as individuals. Many competitors are significantly larger than we are, have well established operating histories and may have greater access to capital, more resources and other advantages over us. These competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments or to compromise underwriting standards and, as a result, our origination volume and profit margins could be adversely affected. 
 Our Manager 
 We are externally managed and advised by our Manager and benefit from the personnel, relationships and experience of our Manager s executive team and other personnel of Starwood Capital Group. Pursuant to the terms of a management agreement between our Manager and us, our Manager provides us with our management team and appropriate support personnel. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between our Manager and Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC, our Manager has access to the personnel and resources of Starwood Capital Group necessary for the implementation and execution of our business strategy. 
 Our Manager is an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately-held private equity firm founded and controlled by Mr. Sternlicht. Starwood Capital Group has invested in all major real estate asset classes, directly and indirectly, through operating companies, portfolios of properties and single assets. Starwood Capital Group invests at different levels of the capital structure, including equity, preferred equity, mezzanine debt and senior debt, depending on the asset risk profile and return expectation. 
 Our Manager draws upon the experience and expertise of Starwood Capital Group s team of professionals and support personnel operating in 16 cities across seven countries. Our Manager also benefits from Starwood Capital Group s dedicated asset management group operating in offices located in the U.S. and abroad. We also benefit from Starwood Capital Group s portfolio management, finance and administration functions, which address legal, compliance, investor relations and operational matters, asset valuation, risk management and information technologies in connection with the performance of our Manager s duties. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 290 full-time employees, the majority of which are real estate professionals located throughout the U.S. The Company strives to be an employer of choice, and is therefore highly focused on creating and maintaining best in class recruitment, retention and compensation programs and a culture designed to encourage performance, integrity and well-being. The Company believes that its competitive compensation, outstanding benefits, training opportunities and stimulating work environment help attract and retain people with exceptional financial and real estate skills. 
 Taxation of the Company 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes. We generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. 
 Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and property. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate 
 14 

Table of Content s 

 rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and will not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. 
 We utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs to conduct certain activities that would generate non-qualifying income or income subject to the prohibited transaction tax if earned directly by the REIT, and to hold certain assets that would represent non-qualifying assets if held directly by the REIT. In most cases, income associated with a TRS is fully taxable because a TRS is classified as a regular corporation for income tax purposes. 
 See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT for additional tax status information.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 We are subject to a number of risks that, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Some of our more significant challenges and risks include, but are not limited to, the following, which are described in greater detail below: 
 We are dependent on Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager and their key personnel, who provide services to us through the management agreement, and we may not find a suitable replacement for our Manager and Starwood Capital Group if the management agreement is terminated, or for these key personnel if they leave Starwood Capital Group or otherwise become unavailable to us. 
 There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 The management agreement with our Manager was not negotiated on an arm s-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party and may be costly and difficult to terminate. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and continuing outbreaks and new variants could continue to disrupt, U.S. and global economic activity and financial markets, and could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance. 
 Our access to sources of financing may be limited and thus our ability to maximize our returns may be adversely affected. 
 15 

Table of Content s 

 Our significant indebtedness subjects us to increased risk of loss and may reduce cash available for distributions to our stockholders. 
 Interest rate fluctuations could significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments. Macroeconomic trends, including inflation and rising interest rates, may adversely affect us. 
 Hedging may adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 
 Difficult conditions in the mortgage, commercial and residential real estate markets may cause us to experience market losses related to our holdings. 
 Our commercial construction or rehabilitation lending may expose us to increased lending risks. 
 The commercial mortgage loans we originate or acquire and the mortgage loans underlying our CMBS investments are subject to the ability of the commercial property owner to generate net income from operating the property, as well as the risks of delinquency and foreclosure. 
 If we overestimate the yields or incorrectly price the risks of our investments, we may experience losses. 
 The B-Notes that we acquire are subject to additional risks related to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the transaction, which may result in losses to us. Our mezzanine loans involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by similar income-producing properties. 
 We may acquire and sell from time to time residential loans, including non-QM loans, which may subject us to legal, regulatory and other risks, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 The residential loans that we may acquire, and that underlie the RMBS we acquire, are subject to risks particular to investments secured by mortgage loans on residential property. These risks are heightened because we may purchase non-performing loans. 
 Prepayment rates may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio. 
 Some of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of these investments. We may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets. 
 Investments outside the U.S. that are denominated in foreign currencies subject us to foreign currency risks and to the uncertainty of foreign laws and markets, which may adversely affect our distributions and our REIT status. 
 We invest in equity interests in commercial real estate assets, which subjects us to the general risks of owning commercial real estate. 
 We have sponsored, and purchased the more junior securities of, CLOs and such instruments involve significant risks, including that these securities receive distributions from the CLO only if the CLO generates enough income to first pay all the investors holding senior tranches and all CLO expenses. 
 We are subject to the risks of investing in project finance investments, many of which are outside our control, and that may negatively impact our business and financial results. 
 The investment portfolio of our Infrastructure Lending Segment is concentrated in the power industry, which subjects the portfolio to more risks than if the investments were more diversified. The power industry is subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely impact the business and financial performance of the projects to which our infrastructure loans relate. 
 The business activities of our Investing and Servicing Segment, particularly our special servicing business, expose us to certain risks. 
 The risks of investment in subordinated CMBS are magnified in the case of our Investing and Servicing Segment, where the principal payments received by the CMBS trust are made in priority to the higher rated securities. 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law and of our charter could inhibit changes in control. 
 Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limits on our operations. 
 If we do not qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 
 Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. 
 We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

 The above list is not exhaustive, and we face additional challenges and risks. Please carefully consider all of the information in this Form 10-K, including the risk factors set forth below in this Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 
 Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager 
 We are dependent on Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager and their key personnel, who provide services to us through the management agreement, and we may not find a suitable replacement for our Manager and Starwood Capital Group if the management agreement is terminated, or for these key personnel if they leave Starwood Capital Group or otherwise become unavailable to us. 
 Our Manager has significant discretion as to the implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. Accordingly, we believe that our success depends to a material extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the officers and key personnel of our Manager. The officers and key personnel of our Manager evaluate, negotiate, close and monitor a substantial portion of our investments; therefore, our success depends on their continued service. The departure of any of the officers or key personnel of our Manager could have a material adverse effect on our performance. 
 We offer no assurance that our Manager will remain our investment manager or that we will continue to have access to our Manager s officers and key personnel. The terms of our management agreement with our Manager and the investment advisory agreement between our Manager and Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC are automatically renewed on an annual basis; provided, however, that our Manager may terminate the management agreement annually upon 180 days prior notice. If the management agreement and the investment advisory agreement are terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to continue to execute our business plan. 
 There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager. Specifically, Mr. Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey G. Dishner, one of our other directors, and certain of our executive officers are executives of Starwood Capital Group. 
 Our Manager and executive officers may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, Starwood Capital Group and its other investment funds. From time to time, one or more private investment funds sponsored by Starwood Capital Group (collectively, Starwood Private Real Estate Funds may be subject to exclusivity provisions that require all or a portion of investment opportunities related to real estate to be allocated to such Starwood Private Real Estate Funds rather than to us. Subject to the provisions of the co-investment and allocation agreement as described in the next paragraph, there can be no assurance that future Starwood Private Real Estate Funds would not be subject to such exclusivity requirements and, as a result, they may acquire investment opportunities that would not be available to us. Our independent directors do not approve each co-investment made by the Starwood Private Real Estate Funds and us unless the amount of capital we invest in the proposed co-investment otherwise requires the review and approval of our independent directors pursuant to our investment guidelines. Pursuant to the exclusivity provisions of the Starwood Private Real Estate Funds, our investment strategy may not include either (i) equity interests in real estate or (ii) near-to-medium-term loan to own investments, in each case (of both (i) and (ii)) if such investments are expected, at the time such investment is made, to produce an internal rate of return IRR within the target return threshold specified in the governing documents of one or more Starwood Private Real Estate Funds. Therefore, our board of directors does not have the flexibility to expand our investment strategy to include equity interests in real estate or near-term loan to own investments with such an IRR expectation. 
 Our Manager, Starwood Capital Group and their respective affiliates may sponsor or manage one or more publicly traded investment vehicles, public reporting vehicles or funds that invest generally in real estate assets but not primarily in our target assets (as defined in our co-investment and allocation agreement) or one or more publicly traded investment vehicles, public reporting vehicles, or funds that do invest in some of our target assets (a potential competing vehicle ). Our Manager and Starwood Capital Group have also agreed in our co-investment and allocation agreement that for so long as the management agreement is in effect and our Manager and Starwood Capital Group are under common control, no entity controlled by Starwood Capital Group will sponsor or manage a potential competing vehicle unless Starwood Capital Group adopts a policy that either (i) provides for the fair and equitable allocation of investment opportunities in our target assets (as defined in our co-investment and allocation agreement) among all such vehicles and us or (ii) provides us the right to co-invest with respect to any target assets (as defined in our co-investment and allocation agreement) with such vehicles, in each case subject to the suitability of each investment opportunity for the particular vehicle and us and each such vehicle s and our availability of cash for investment. To the extent that there is overlap between our investment program and that of a Starwood Private Real Estate Fund, a fair and equitable allocation policy may involve a co-investment between us and such Starwood Private Real Estate Fund or a chronological rotation between us and such Starwood Private Real Estate Fund. Although 
 17 

Table of Content s 

 Starwood Capital Group has adopted such an investment allocation policy, Starwood Capital Group has some discretion as to how investment opportunities are allocated. As a result, we may either not be presented with the opportunity to participate in these investments or may be limited in our ability to invest. 
 Our board of directors has adopted a policy with respect to any proposed investments by our directors or officers or the officers of our Manager, which we refer to as the covered persons, in any of our target asset classes. This policy provides that any proposed investment by a covered person for his or her own account in any of our target asset classes will be permitted if the capital required for the investment does not exceed the personal investment limit. To the extent that a proposed investment exceeds the personal investment limit, we expect that our board of directors will only permit the covered person to make the investment (i) upon the approval of the disinterested directors or (ii) if the proposed investment otherwise complies with terms of any other related party transaction policy our board of directors has adopted. Subject to compliance with all applicable laws, these individuals may make investments for their own account in our target assets which may present certain conflicts of interest not addressed by our current policies. 
 We pay our Manager substantial base management fees regardless of the performance of our portfolio. Our Manager s entitlement to a base management fee, which is not based upon performance metrics or goals, might reduce its incentive to devote its time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. This in turn could hurt both our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. 
 Excluding our operating subsidiaries, we do not have any employees except for Andrew Sossen, our Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, and Rina Paniry, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer, whom Starwood Capital Group has seconded to us exclusively. Mr. Sossen and Ms. Paniry are also employees of other entities affiliated with our Manager and, as a result, are subject to potential conflicts of interest in service as our employees and as employees of such entities. 
 The management agreement with our Manager was not negotiated on an arm s-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party and may be costly and difficult to terminate. 
 Certain of our executive officers and two of our directors are executives of Starwood Capital Group. Our management agreement with our Manager was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. 
 Termination of the management agreement with our Manager without cause is difficult and costly. Our independent directors will review our Manager s performance and the management fees annually and the management agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (i) our Manager s unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or (ii) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager s right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. Our Manager will be provided 180 days prior notice of any such a termination. Additionally, upon such a termination, the management agreement provides that we will pay our Manager a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee received by our Manager during the prior 24-month period before such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. These provisions may increase the cost to us of terminating the management agreement and adversely affect our ability to terminate our Manager without cause. 
 Our Manager may terminate the management agreement annually upon 180 days prior notice. If the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to continue to execute our business plan. 
 Pursuant to the management agreement, our Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Our Manager maintains a contractual, as opposed to a fiduciary, relationship with us. Under the terms of the management agreement, our Manager, its officers, members, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager and any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager (the indemnified parties will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary s stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties under the management agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify the indemnified parties with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts or omissions of our Manager not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement. 
 The incentive fee payable to our Manager under the management agreement is payable quarterly and is based on our Distributable Earnings and, therefore, may cause our Manager to select investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation.

 Our Manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation based upon our achievement of targeted levels of Distributable Earnings (which is referred to as Core Earnings in our management agreement). In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on Distributable Earnings may lead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of Distributable Earnings at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could result in increased risk to the value of our investment portfolio. 
 Distributable Earnings is not a measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and is defined within Item 7 Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 
 Our conflicts of interest policy may not adequately address all of the conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to our investment activities and also may limit the allocation of investments to us. 
 In order to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager, Starwood Capital Group, any of their affiliates or any investment vehicle sponsored or managed by Starwood Capital Group or any of its affiliates, which we refer to as the Starwood parties, we have adopted a conflicts of interest policy to specifically address some of the conflicts relating to our investment opportunities. Although under this policy the approval of a majority of our independent directors is required to approve (i) any purchase of our assets by any of the Starwood parties and (ii) any purchase by us of any assets of any of the Starwood parties, this policy may not be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise or may not address such conflicts in a manner that results in the allocation of a particular investment opportunity to us or is otherwise favorable to us. In addition, the Starwood Private Real Estate Funds currently, and additional competing vehicles may in the future, participate in some of our investments, possibly at a more senior level in the capital structure of the underlying borrower and related real estate than our investment. Our interests in such investments may also conflict with the interests of these entities in the event of a default or restructuring of the investment. Participating investments will not be the result of arm s length negotiations and will involve potential conflicts between our interests and those of the other participating entities in obtaining favorable terms. Since certain of our executives are also executives of Starwood Capital Group, the same personnel may determine the price and terms for the investments for both us and these entities and any procedural protections, such as obtaining market prices or other reliable indicators of fair value, may not prevent the consideration we pay for these investments from exceeding their fair value or ensure that we receive terms for a particular investment opportunity that are as favorable as those available from an independent third party. 
 Risks Related to Our Company 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and continuing outbreaks and new variants could continue to disrupt, U.S. and global economic activity and financial markets, and could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and could continue to cause, the global slowdown of economic activity and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. During the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. and global economies came under severe pressure due to numerous factors, including preventive measures taken by governmental authorities and others to alleviate the crisis, such as mandatory business closures, quarantines and restrictions on travel. Our operations and financial performance, as well as the operations and financial performance of many of the borrowers underlying our real estate-related assets and tenants of our owned properties, were negatively impacted as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these preventive measures. While many of these measures have been long since lifted and the negative impacts of COVID-19 appear to be much improved due, in part, to global and domestic vaccination efforts, we cannot predict the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related to both known and unknown risks, including future quarantines, closures and other restrictions resulting from continuing outbreaks or surges in cases of COVID-19 or related variants. As a result, COVID-19's ongoing impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders remains uncertain and difficult to predict. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including related variants, and measures that may be implemented (or re-implemented) in the future to prevent or limit continuing outbreaks or surges and any associated period of economic slowdown or recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, among other matters. Although many or all facets of our business could be adversely impacted by continuing COVID-19 outbreaks and new variants, we currently believe that the following would be among the most material to us: 
 the value of commercial and residential real estate could decline, which could materially and adversely impact the value of our investments. 
 the financial stability of borrowers underlying our real estate-related assets and infrastructure loans could be negatively impacted, which could increase significantly the number of borrowers who become delinquent or default on their loans, or who seek to defer payment on, or refinance, their loans. 
 19 

Table of Content s 

 we could receive margin calls from our lenders as a result of the decline in the market value of the loans or other assets pledged by us to our lenders under our repurchase agreements and warehouse credit facilities, and if we were to fail to resolve such margin calls when due by payment of cash or delivery of additional collateral, the lenders could exercise remedies including demanding payment by us of our aggregate outstanding financing obligations and/or taking ownership of the loans or other assets securing the applicable obligations. Forced sales of the loans or other assets that secure our financing obligations in order to pay outstanding financing obligations may be on terms less favorable to us than might otherwise be available in a regularly functioning market and could result in deficiency judgments and other claims against us. 
 the financial stability of the tenants in the retail and multifamily properties that we own could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact the ability of such tenants to make their rental payments to us on a timely basis or at all. To the extent the number of tenants who are unable to make timely rental payments to us increases significantly, the value of these property investments could be materially impaired. 
 we could fail to meet or satisfy covenants in our repurchase agreements, warehouse credit facilities or other financing arrangements as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in a cross-default or cross-acceleration under other financing arrangements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable (or such amounts may automatically become due and payable), terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. 
 our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis could be materially and adversely affected. The negative impact of continuing COVID-19 outbreaks and new variants could adversely affect our liquidity position and limit our ability to grow our business or execute our business strategy. 
 business activity and demand for mortgage financing, servicing and other real estate and real estate-related transactions could decline, which could adversely affect our ability to source attractive investments or to redeploy the proceeds from repayments of our existing investments. 
 moratoriums on the construction, development or redevelopment of properties underlying our construction or rehabilitation loans, or with respect to infrastructure projects, could be mandated, which could prevent the completion, on a timely basis or at all, of such projects. The repayment of construction or rehabilitation loans often depends on the borrower s ability to secure permanent take-out financing, which requires the successful completion of construction and stabilization of the project, or operation of the property with an income stream sufficient to meet operating expenses. Similarly, because the loan structure for project finance relies primarily on the underlying project s cash flows for repayment, the ability of the project company to repay a project finance loan is dependent upon the successful development, construction and/or operation of such project rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the project company. 
 In addition to the foregoing, we have experienced and may in the future experience other negative impacts to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this Item 1A. 
 Provisions for credit losses are difficult to estimate. 
 Our credit loss provision is evaluated on a quarterly basis. The determination of such provision requires us to make certain estimates and judgments, which may be difficult to determine. Our estimates and judgments are based on a number of factors, including projected cash flow from the collateral securing our loans, debt structure, including the availability of reserves and recourse guarantees, likelihood of repayment in full at the maturity of a loan, potential for refinancing and expected market discount rates for varying property types, all of which remain uncertain and are subjective. Our estimates and judgments may not be correct and, therefore, our results of operations and financial condition could be severely impacted. 
 Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to provide allowances for credit losses on certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held-for-investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, including related future funding commitments and accrued interest receivable. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and updated quarterly thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model previously required under GAAP, which delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. Accordingly, the adoption of the CECL model has materially affected how we determine our credit loss provision and required us to significantly increase our allowance and recognize provisions for credit losses earlier in the lending cycle. Moreover, the CECL model created more volatility in the level of our credit loss 
 20

 provisions. If we are required to materially increase our future level of credit loss allowances for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 
 We have not established a minimum distribution payment level and we may not be able to make distributions to our stockholders in the future at current levels or at all. 
 We are generally required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy through quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in such year, subject to certain adjustments. We have not established a minimum distribution payment level, and our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors contained in this Form 10-K. Although we have made, and anticipate continuing to make, quarterly distributions to our stockholders, our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any future distributions to our stockholders, and such determination will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We believe that a change in any one of the following factors could adversely affect our results of operations and impair our ability to continue to pay distributions to our stockholders: 
 the profitability of the investment of the net proceeds from our equity offerings; 
 our ability to make profitable investments; 
 margin calls or other expenses that reduce our cash flow; 
 defaults in our asset portfolio or decreases in the value of our portfolio; and 
 the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. 
 As a result, distributions to our stockholders in the future may not continue or the level of any future distributions we do make to our stockholders may not achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect our stockholders return on investment. 
 In addition, distributions that we make to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as long-term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gain income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder s investment in our common stock. 
 Risks Related to Sources of Financing 
 Our access to sources of financing may be limited and thus our ability to maximize our returns may be adversely affected. 
 Our financing sources currently include our credit agreements, our master repurchase agreements, our CLOs, our single asset securitization SASB ), our convertible senior notes, our senior notes, our mortgage debt on certain investment properties and common stock and debt offerings. Subject to market conditions and availability, we may seek additional sources of financing in the form of bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, structured financing arrangements, public and private equity and debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset-specific funding arrangements. 
 Our access to additional sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors, over which we have little or no control, including: 
 general market conditions; 
 the market s view of the quality of our assets; 
 the market s perception of our growth potential; 
 our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and 
 the market price of the shares of our common stock. 
 A dislocation and/or weakness in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect one or more private lenders and could cause one or more of our private lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or to increase the costs of that financing. In addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune time or price. 
 To the extent structured financing arrangements are unavailable, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances, which may be dilutive to our stockholders, or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger 
 21 

Table of Content s 

 portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities, cash distributions to our stockholders and other purposes. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost and term) at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our asset acquisition activities and/or dispose of assets, which could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Our significant indebtedness subjects us to increased risk of loss and may reduce cash available for distributions to our stockholders. 
 We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately 20.5 billion (excluding accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, VIE liabilities and unfunded commitments). Our outstanding indebtedness currently includes our credit agreements, our repurchase agreements, our CLOs, our SASB, our convertible senior notes, our senior notes and mortgage debt on certain investment properties. Subject to market conditions and availability, we may incur additional debt through bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, structured financing arrangements, public and private debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset-specific funding arrangements. The percentage of leverage we employ varies depending on our available capital, our ability to obtain and access financing arrangements with lenders and the lenders and rating agencies estimate of the stability of our investment portfolio s cash flow. Our governing documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur. We may significantly increase the amount of leverage we utilize at any time without approval of our board of directors. However, our secured debt agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that in some cases restrict our total leverage (as defined therein). Moreover, the respective indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, subject to a number of exceptions and adjustments, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and require that we maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined therein) of not less than 120 of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding unsecured indebtedness (as defined therein). In addition, we may leverage individual assets at substantially higher levels. Incurring substantial debt subjects us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including the risk that: 
 our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in (i) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (ii) our inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements and/or (iii) the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale; 
 our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, and investment yields may not increase with higher financing costs; 
 we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, stockholder distributions or other purposes; and 
 we may not be able to refinance debt that matures prior to the investment it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all. 
 In addition, subject to certain conditions, the lenders under our credit facilities retain the sole discretion over the market value of loans and/or securities that serve as collateral for the borrowings under our credit facilities for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to such lenders. 
 Interest rate fluctuations could significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments. Macroeconomic trends, including inflation and rising interest rates, may adversely affect us. 
 Our primary interest rate exposures relate to the following: 
 changes in interest rates may affect the yield on our investments and the financing cost of our debt, as well as the performance of our interest rate swaps that we utilize for hedging purposes, which could result in operating losses for us should interest expense exceed interest income; 
 declines in interest rates may reduce the yield on existing floating rate assets and/or the yield on prospective investments; 
 changes in the level of interest rates may affect our ability to source investments; 
 increases in the level of interest rates may negatively impact the value of our investments and our ability to realize gains from the disposition of assets; 
 increases in the level of interest rates may (x) increase the credit risk of our assets by negatively impacting the ability of our borrowers to pay debt service or our ability to refinance our assets upon maturity and (y) negatively impact the 
 22 

Table of Content s 

 value of the real estate supporting our investments (or that we own directly) through the impact such increases can have on property valuation capitalization rates; and 
 changes in interest rates and/or the differential between U.S. dollar interest rates and those of non-dollar currencies in which we invest can adversely affect the value of our non-dollar assets and/or associated currency hedging transactions. 
 Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets, net of credit losses, and our financing costs. We anticipate that for any period during which our assets are not match-funded, the income from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates may significantly influence our net income. Interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses for us. 
 Inflation in the U.S. has recently accelerated and is currently expected to continue at an elevated level in the near-term. In 2022, the Federal Reserve began raising the federal funds rate in an effort to curb inflation, and rates may continue to be increased. The Federal Reserve's increases, coupled with other macroeconomic factors, may trigger a recession in the U.S., globally, or both. Increased inflation and interest rates could have an adverse impact on us, as described above in this risk factor. In addition, we cannot assure you that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. Such future constraints could increase borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or to refinance existing obligations and commitments, which could slow or deter future growth. 
 We are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. 
 Our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. The Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") ceased publishing one-week and two-month LIBOR after December 31, 2021 and intends to cease publishing all remaining LIBOR index maturities after June 30, 2023. Despite the expected publication of the principal U.S. dollar LIBOR settings through June 30, 2023, the FCA has prohibited the firms it regulates from using such settings in new contracts after December 31, 2021 (subject to limited exceptions), and certain U.S. (and other) regulators have stated that no new contracts using U.S. dollar LIBOR should be entered into after that date. 
 Accordingly, many LIBOR obligations have transitioned to another benchmark or will do so. Different types of financial products have transitioned, or are expected to transition, to different alternative benchmarks; and there is no assurance that any alternative benchmark will be the economic equivalent of any LIBOR setting. For some existing LIBOR-based obligations, the contractual consequences of the discontinuation of LIBOR may not be clear. Although the foregoing reflects the timing (or expected timing) of LIBOR discontinuation and certain consequences, there is no assurance that LIBOR, of any particular currency or tenor, will continue to be published until any particular date or in any particular form, and there is no assurance regarding the consequences of LIBOR discontinuation. Uncertainty as to the foregoing and the nature of alternative reference rates may adversely impact the availability and costs of borrowings. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the LIBOR transition and the establishment of alternative reference rates, and there is no assurance that we have identified all material potential effects that these events may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 SOFR is expected to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and SONIA is replacing sterling LIBOR, which subjects us to various risks. 
 In the United States, there have been efforts to identify alternative reference interest rates for U.S. dollar LIBOR. The cash markets have generally coalesced around recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the ARRC ), which was convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York FRBNY ). The ARRC has recommended that U.S. dollar LIBOR be replaced by rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus, in the case of existing LIBOR contracts and obligations, a spread adjustment. The derivatives markets are also expected to use SOFR-based rates to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act ), enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings with a benchmark rate based on SOFR for certain contracts governed by U.S. law. In December 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System adopted rules identifying different SOFR-based replacement rates for financial contracts subject to the LIBOR Act after June 30, 2023. 
 SOFR has a limited history, having been first published in April 2018. The future performance of SOFR, and SOFR-based reference rates, cannot be predicted based on SOFR s history or otherwise. Future levels of SOFR may bear little or no relation to historical levels of SOFR, LIBOR or other rates. SOFR-based rates will differ from U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the differences may be material. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing funds overnight in transactions that are collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Because SOFR is a financing rate based on overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. LIBOR is intended to be an unsecured rate that represents interbank funding 
 23 

Table of Content s 

 costs for different short-term tenors. It is a forward-looking rate reflecting expectations regarding interest rates for those tenors. Thus, LIBOR is intended to be sensitive to bank credit risk and to short-term interest rate risk. In contrast, SOFR is a secured overnight rate reflecting the credit of U.S. Treasury securities as collateral. It is intended to be insensitive to credit risk and to risks related to interest rates other than overnight rates. SOFR has been more volatile than other benchmark or market rates, such as three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, during certain periods. 
 It is expected that more than one SOFR-based rate will be used in the financial markets. Like LIBOR, some SOFR-based rates will be forward-looking term rates; other SOFR-based rates will be intended to resemble rates for term structures through their use of averaging mechanisms applied to rates from overnight transactions, as in the case of simple average or compounded average SOFR. Different kinds of SOFR-based rates will result in different interest rates. Mismatches between SOFR-based rates, and between SOFR-based rates and other rates, may cause economic inefficiencies, particularly if market participants seek to hedge one kind of SOFR-based rate by entering into hedge transactions based on another SOFR-based rate or another rate. For these reasons, among others, there is no assurance that SOFR, or rates derived from SOFR, will perform in the same or a similar way as U.S. dollar LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no assurance that SOFR-based rates will be a suitable substitute for U.S. dollar LIBOR. 
 In the United Kingdom, the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates has recommended SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average), published by the Bank of England, as the risk-free rate for the sterling markets. SONIA is used extensively across the sterling derivative, loan and bond markets. A large number of contracts formerly based on sterling LIBOR have transitioned to using SONIA as their benchmark. However, certain contracts continue to use sterling LIBOR settings that (as noted above) are now being published only on a synthetic basis . Similar to the position described above with regard to U.S. dollar LIBOR and SOFR, there are different bases for determining SONIA rates (including compounded rates and term rates), different SONIA-based rates may be, or become, customary in different markets or products, and practice continues to develop in these (and other) respects. Mismatches could exist among different SONIA-based rates, and between any SONIA-based rate and any other rate. There is no assurance that SONIA, or rates derived from SONIA, will perform in the same or a similar way as sterling LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no assurance that SONIA-based rates will be a suitable substitute for sterling LIBOR. 
 
 Non-LIBOR floating rate obligations, including SOFR-based or SONIA-based obligations, may have returns and values that fluctuate more than those of floating rate obligations that are based on LIBOR or other rates. Also, because SOFR, the current forms of SONIA, and some alternative floating rates are relatively new market indexes, markets for certain non-LIBOR obligations may never develop or may not be liquid. Market terms for non-LIBOR floating rate obligations, such as the spread over the index reflected in interest rate provisions, may evolve over time, and prices of non-LIBOR floating rate obligations may be different depending on when they are issued and changing views about correct spread levels. 
 These matters may adversely affect financial markets generally and may also adversely affect our operations specifically, particularly as financial markets continue to transition away from LIBOR. 
 Our warehouse facilities may limit our ability to acquire assets, and we may incur losses if the collateral is liquidated. 
 We utilize warehouse facilities pursuant to which we accumulate mortgage loans in anticipation of a securitization financing, which assets are pledged as collateral for such facilities until the securitization transaction is consummated. In order to borrow funds to acquire assets under any additional warehouse facilities, we expect that our lenders thereunder would have the right to review the potential assets for which we are seeking financing. We may be unable to obtain the consent of a lender to acquire assets that we believe would be beneficial to us and we may be unable to obtain alternate financing for such assets. In addition, a securitization transaction may not be consummated with respect to the assets being warehoused. If the securitization is not consummated, the lender could liquidate the warehoused collateral and we would then have to pay any amount by which the original purchase price of the collateral assets exceeds its sale price, subject to negotiated caps, if any, on our exposure. In addition, regardless of whether the securitization is consummated, if any of the warehoused collateral is sold before the consummation, we would have to bear any resulting loss on the sale. We may not be able to obtain additional warehouse facilities on favorable terms, or at all. 
 The utilization of our repurchase agreements is subject to the pre-approval of the lender. 
 We utilize repurchase agreements to finance certain investments. In order for us to borrow funds under a repurchase agreement, our lender must have the right to review the potential assets for which we are seeking financing and approve such assets in its sole discretion. Accordingly, we may be unable to obtain the consent of a lender to finance an investment and alternate sources of financing for such asset may not exist. 
 24 

Table of Content s 

 A failure to comply with restrictive covenants in our financing arrangements would have a material adverse effect on us, and any future financings may require us to provide additional collateral or pay down debt. 
 We are subject to various restrictive covenants contained in our existing financing arrangements and may become subject to additional covenants in connection with future financings. Our credit agreements contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt or liens, make certain investments or acquisitions, merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of our assets or otherwise dispose of property and assets, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, change the nature of our business or enter into transactions with affiliates. Our credit agreements, as well as our master repurchase agreements, each requires us to maintain compliance with various financial covenants, including, as applicable, a minimum tangible net worth and cash liquidity, and specified financial ratios, such as total debt to total assets and EBITDA to fixed charges or loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the respective indentures governing our respective senior notes contain covenants that, subject to a number of exceptions, adjustments and, in certain circumstances, termination provisions, among other things: limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness; require that we maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined therein) of not less than 120 of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding unsecured indebtedness (as defined therein); and impose certain requirements in order for us to merge or consolidate with another person. 
 These covenants may limit our flexibility to pursue certain investments or incur additional debt. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under these agreements and our indebtedness could be declared due and payable. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing collateral. We may also be subject to cross-default and acceleration rights and, with respect to collateralized debt, the posting of additional collateral and foreclosure rights upon default. Further, such limitations on our liquidity could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Our credit agreements and master repurchase agreements also involve the risk that the market value of the loans pledged or sold by us to the repurchase agreement counterparty or provider of the bank credit facility may decline in value, in which case the lender may require us to provide additional collateral or to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. We may not have the funds available to repay our debt at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. Posting additional collateral would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets. If we cannot meet these requirements, the lender could accelerate our indebtedness, increase the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow funds from them, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to continue to implement our business plan. In addition, in the event that the lender files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, our loans may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us, at least temporarily, of the benefit of these assets. Such an event could restrict our access to bank credit facilities and increase our cost of capital. 
 If one or more of our Manager s executive officers are no longer employed by our Manager, the financial institutions providing us financing may not provide future financing to us, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 If financial institutions with whom we seek to finance our investments require that one or more of our Manager s executives continue to serve in such capacity and if one or more of our Manager s executives are no longer employed by our Manager, it may constitute an event of default and the financial institution providing the arrangement may have acceleration rights with respect to outstanding borrowings and termination rights with respect to our ability to finance our future investments with that institution. If we are unable to obtain financing for our accelerated borrowings and for our future investments under such circumstances, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We directly or indirectly utilize non-recourse securitizations, and such structures expose us to risks that could result in losses to us. 
 We utilize non-recourse securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our REIT qualification and exemption from the Investment Company Act in order to generate cash for funding new investments and/or to leverage existing assets. In most instances, this involves us transferring our loans to a special purpose securitization entity in exchange for cash. In some sale transactions, we also retain a subordinated interest in the loans sold. The securitization of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the subordinated interest we retain in the loans sold would be subordinate to the senior interest in the loans sold, and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a loan sold before the owners of the senior interest experience any losses. Moreover, we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates. The inability to consummate securitizations of our portfolio investments to finance our investments on a long-term basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price, which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to continue to grow our business.

 We may not have the ability to raise funds on acceptable terms necessary to settle conversions of our outstanding convertible senior notes or to purchase our outstanding convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 250.0 million in principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding. If a fundamental change within the meaning of our outstanding convertible senior notes occurs, holders of those notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash any or all of their notes. The fundamental change purchase price will equal 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In addition, upon conversion of the convertible senior notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted, unless we elect to settle the conversion entirely in shares of our common stock. However, we may not have sufficient funds at the time we are required to purchase the notes surrendered therefor or to make cash payments on the notes being converted, and we may not be able to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms. If we were unable to raise necessary funding on acceptable terms, our operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted if we were required to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion. 
 Risks Related to Hedging 
 We enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future. 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, part of our investment strategy involves entering into hedging transactions that require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances (such as the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument). The amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. These economic losses will be reflected in our results of operations, and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition. 
 Hedging may adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest and foreign currency rates. Our hedging activity varies in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, the types of assets held and other changing market conditions. Hedging may fail to protect us or could adversely affect us because, among other things: 
 interest rate, currency and/or credit hedging can be expensive and may result in us receiving less interest income; 
 available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought; 
 due to a credit loss, prepayment or asset sale, the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related asset or liability; 
 the amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions (other than hedging transactions that satisfy certain requirements of the Code or that are done through a TRS) to offset losses is limited by U.S. federal tax provisions governing REITs; 
 the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and 
 the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay. 
 In addition, we may fail to recalculate, readjust or execute hedges in an efficient manner. 
 Any hedging activity in which we engage may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions seeking to reduce risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates, credit spreads or currencies may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged may vary materially. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. 
 Hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities and involve risks and costs that could result in material losses. 
 The cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. In addition, some hedging instruments involve risk because they often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities. Consequently, in many cases, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. Furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions 
 26 

Table of Content s 

 may depend on compliance with applicable securities, commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction that is not cleared on a regulated centralized clearing house will most likely result in its default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover our commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. We cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in significant losses. 
 We may fail to qualify for, or choose not to elect, hedge accounting treatment. 
 We record derivative and hedging transactions in accordance with GAAP. Under these standards, we may fail to qualify for, or choose not to elect, hedge accounting treatment for a number of reasons, including if we use instruments that do not meet the definition of a derivative (such as short sales), we fail to satisfy hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or our instruments are not highly effective. If we fail to qualify for, or choose not to elect, hedge accounting treatment, our operating results may be volatile because changes in the fair value of the derivatives that we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction or item. 
 Risks Related to Our Real Estate-Related Investments 
 The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 
 The lack of liquidity of our investments in real estate loans and investments, other than certain of our investments in MBS, may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. Many of the securities we purchase are not registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in a prohibition against their transfer, sale, pledge or their disposition, except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of, or otherwise in accordance with, those laws. In addition, certain investments such as B-Notes, mezzanine loans and bridge and other loans are also particularly illiquid investments due to their short life, their potential unsuitability for securitization and/or the greater difficulty of recovery in the event of a borrower default. As a result, many of our current investments are, and our future investments will be, illiquid and if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. Further, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a business entity to the extent that we or our Manager has or could be attributed with material non-public information regarding such business entity. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In connection with certain contributions of properties to our subsidiary, SPT Dolphin Intermediate LLC SPT Dolphin ), we have entered into a tax protection agreement with the contributors of such properties, pursuant to which SPT Dolphin is generally restricted from transferring the applicable properties during a specified period unless such contributors are indemnified against the tax liability on their shares of any gain recognized in such transfers (as well as any such tax liability arising due to SPT Dolphin not maintaining a specified level of nonrecourse debt on those properties during the specified period). This tax protection agreement, and any additional tax protection agreements that a subsidiary of ours may enter into in the future, will limit our flexibility to sell or otherwise dispose of, or to reduce the amount of indebtedness encumbering, the relevant properties even if it would otherwise be economically advantageous to us to do so. 
 Our investments may be concentrated and are subject to risk of default. 
 While we seek to diversify our portfolio of investments, we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria, except as may be set forth in the investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors. Therefore, our investments in our target assets may at times be concentrated in certain property types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure or secured by properties concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations. To the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in any one region or type of asset, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our investments within a short time period, which may reduce our net income and the value of our common stock and accordingly reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Difficult conditions in the mortgage, commercial and residential real estate markets may cause us to experience market losses related to our holdings. 
 Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the real estate markets, the financial markets and the economy generally. Concerns about the real estate market, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets going forward. The residential mortgage market has been affected by changes in the lending landscape, and there is no assurance that these conditions have stabilized or that they will not worsen. The disruption in the residential mortgage market has an impact on new demand for homes, which weigh on future home price performance. There is a strong inverse correlation between home price 
 27 

Table of Content s 

 growth rates and mortgage loan delinquencies. Deterioration in the real estate market may cause us to experience losses related to our assets and to sell assets at a loss. Declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect our results of operations and credit availability, which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Our preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing. 
 We make preferred equity investments. These investments involve a higher degree of risk than conventional debt financing due to a variety of factors, including their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking to other loans and liabilities of the entity in which such preferred equity is held. Accordingly, if the issuer defaults on our investment, we would only be able to proceed against such entity in accordance with the terms of the preferred security and not against any property owned by such entity. Furthermore, in the event of bankruptcy or foreclosure, we would only be able to recoup our investment after all lenders to, and other creditors of, such entity are paid in full. As a result, we may lose all or a significant part of our investment, which could result in significant losses. 
 Our commercial construction or rehabilitation lending may expose us to increased lending risks. 
 Construction or rehabilitation loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than permanent commercial mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the borrower s ability to secure permanent take-out financing, which requires the successful completion of construction, renovation, refurbishment or expansion and stabilization of the project, or operation of the property with an income stream sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service on such replacement financing. For construction or rehabilitation loans, increased risks include the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction, renovation, refurbishment or expansion and the estimated cost of construction, renovation, refurbishment or expansion all of which may be affected by unanticipated delays and cost over-runs. Such loans typically involve an expectation that the borrower s sponsors will contribute sufficient equity funds in order to keep the loan in balance, and the sponsors failure or inability to meet this obligation could result in delays in construction, renovation, refurbishment or expansion or an inability to complete such work. Commercial construction or rehabilitation loans also expose the lender to additional risks of contractor non-performance or borrower disputes with contractors resulting in mechanic s or materialmen s liens on the property and possible further delay. In addition, since such loans generally entail greater risk than mortgage loans on income producing property, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with such loans. Further, as the lender under a construction or rehabilitation loan, we may be obligated to fund all or a significant portion of the loan at one or more future dates. We may not have the funds available at such future date(s) to meet our funding obligations under the loan. In that event, we would likely be in breach of the loan unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. In addition, many of our construction or rehabilitation loans have multiple lenders and if another lender fails to fund, we could be faced with the choice of either funding for that defaulting lender or suffering a delay or protracted interruption in the progress of construction, renovation, refurbishment or expansion. 
 The commercial mortgage loans we originate or acquire and the mortgage loans underlying our CMBS investments are subject to the ability of the commercial property owner to generate net income from operating the property, as well as the risks of delinquency and foreclosure. 
 Commercial mortgage loans are secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss may be greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of single-family residential property. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of an income-producing property can be adversely affected by, among other things, 
 tenant mix; 
 success of tenant businesses; 
 property management decisions; 
 property location, condition and design; 
 competition from comparable types of properties; 
 changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; 
 changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments, including the credit and securitization markets; 
 declines in regional or local real estate values; 
 declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; 
 28 

Table of Content s 

 increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; 
 costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions; 
 the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses; 
 changes in governmental laws and regulations, including fiscal policies, zoning ordinances and environmental legislation and the related costs of compliance; and 
 acts of God, terrorist attacks, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, global climate change, social unrest and civil disturbances. 
 In the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. In the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. Foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan. 
 Our investments in CMBS are generally subject to losses. 
 Our investments in CMBS are subject to losses. In general, losses on a mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan included in a securitization will be borne first by the equity holder of the property, then by a cash reserve fund or letter of credit, if any, then by the holder of a mezzanine loan or B-Note, if any, then by the first loss subordinated security holder (generally, the B-Piece buyer) and then by the holder of a higher-rated security. In the event of default and the exhaustion of any equity support, reserve fund, letter of credit, mezzanine loans or B-Notes, and any classes of securities junior to those in which we invest, we will not be able to recover all of our investment in the securities we purchase. In addition, if the underlying mortgage portfolio has been overvalued by the originator, or if the values subsequently decline and, as a result, less collateral is available to satisfy interest and principal payments due on the related CMBS, there would be an increased risk of loss. The prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than more highly rated investments, but more sensitive to adverse economic downturns or individual issuer developments. 
 Dislocations, illiquidity and volatility in the market for commercial real estate as well as the broader financial markets could adversely affect the performance and value of commercial mortgage loans, the demand for CMBS and the value of CMBS investments. 
 Any significant dislocations, illiquidity or volatility in the real estate and securitization markets, including the market for CMBS, as well as global financial markets and the economy generally, could adversely affect our business and financial results. We cannot assure you that dislocations in the commercial mortgage loan market will not occur in the future. 
 Challenging economic conditions affect the financial strength of many commercial, multifamily and other tenants and result in increased rent delinquencies and decreased occupancy. Economic challenges may lead to decreased occupancy, decreased rents or other declines in income from, or the value of, commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community real estate. 
 Declining commercial real estate values, coupled with tighter underwriting standards for commercial real estate loans, may prevent commercial borrowers from refinancing their mortgages, which results in increased delinquencies and defaults on commercial, multifamily and other mortgage loans. Declines in commercial real estate values also result in reduced borrower equity, further hindering borrowers ability to refinance in an environment of increasingly restrictive lending standards and giving them less incentive to cure delinquencies and avoid foreclosure. The lack of refinancing opportunities has impacted and could impact in the future, in particular, mortgage loans that do not fully amortize and on which there is a substantial balloon payment due at maturity, because borrowers generally expect to refinance these types of loans on or prior to their maturity date. Finally, declining commercial real estate values and the associated increases in loan-to-value ratios would result in lower recoveries on foreclosure and an increase in losses above those that would have been realized had commercial property values remained the same or increased. Continuing defaults, delinquencies and losses would further decrease property values, thereby resulting in additional defaults by commercial mortgage borrowers, further credit constraints and further declines in property values. 
 If we overestimate the yields or incorrectly price the risks of our investments, we may experience losses. 
 We value our investments based on yields and risks, taking into account estimated future losses on the mortgage loans and the underlying collateral included in the securitization s pools, and the estimated impact of these losses on expected future cash flows and returns. Our loss estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. In the event that 
 29 

Table of Content s 

 we underestimate the asset level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular investment, we may experience losses with respect to such investment. 
 Real estate valuation is inherently subjective and uncertain. 
 The valuation of real estate and therefore the valuation of any underlying security relating to loans made by us is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location, the expected future rental revenues from that particular property and the valuation methodology adopted. In addition, where we invest in construction loans, initial valuations will assume completion of the project. As a result, the valuations of the real estate assets against which we make loans are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions and methodologies that may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility, low transaction flow or restricted debt availability in the commercial or residential real estate markets. 
 Any investments in corporate bank debt and debt securities of commercial real estate operating or finance companies are subject to the specific risks relating to the particular companies and to the general risks of investing in real estate-related loans and securities, which may result in significant losses. 
 We may invest in corporate bank debt and in debt securities of commercial real estate operating or finance companies. These investments involve special risks relating to the particular company, including its financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, business and prospects. In particular, the debt securities are often non-collateralized and may also be subordinated to its other obligations. We also invest in debt securities of companies that are not rated or are rated non-investment grade by one or more rating agencies. Investments that are not rated or are rated non-investment grade have a higher risk of default than investment grade rated assets and therefore may result in losses to us. We have not adopted any limit on such investments. 
 These investments also subject us to the risks inherent with real estate-related investments, including: 
 risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss in the event thereof; 
 the dependence upon the successful operation of, and net income from, real property; 
 risks generally incident to interests in real property; and 
 risks specific to the type and use of a particular property. 
 These risks may adversely affect the value of our investments in commercial real estate operating and finance companies and the ability of the issuers thereof to make principal and interest payments in a timely manner, or at all, and could result in significant losses. 
 Investments in non-conforming and non-investment grade rated loans or securities involve increased risk of loss. 
 Many of our investments do not conform to conventional loan standards applied by traditional lenders and either are not rated or rated as non-investment grade by the rating agencies. The non-investment grade credit ratings for these assets typically result from the overall leverage of the loans, the lack of a strong operating history for the properties underlying the loans, the borrowers credit history, the properties underlying cash flow or other factors. As a result, these investments have a higher risk of default and loss than investment grade rated assets. Any loss we incur may be significant and may reduce distributions to our stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock. There are no limits on the percentage of unrated or non-investment grade rated assets we may hold in our investment portfolio. 
 Any credit ratings assigned to our investments are subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded. 
 Some of our investments are rated by Moody s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., S P Global Ratings, DBRS, Inc. or Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. Any credit ratings on our investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce or withdraw, or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our investments in the future, the value of these investments could significantly decline, which would adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and could result in losses upon disposition or the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us. 
 The B-Notes that we acquire are subject to additional risks related to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the transaction, which may result in losses to us. 
 We invest in B-Notes. A B-Note is a mortgage loan typically (i) secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or group of related properties and (ii) subordinated to an A-Note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral. As a result, if a borrower defaults, there may not be sufficient funds remaining for a B-Note holder after payment to the A-Note holder. However, because each transaction is privately negotiated, B-Notes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks. For example, the rights of holders of B-Notes to control the process following a borrower default may 
 30 

Table of Content s 

 vary from transaction to transaction. Further, B-Notes typically are secured by a single property and so reflect the risks associated with significant concentration. Significant losses related to our B-Notes would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our mezzanine loans involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. 
 We invest in mezzanine loans, which sometimes take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or more commonly take the form of loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. Significant losses related to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Bridge loans involve a greater risk of loss than traditional investment-grade mortgage loans with fully insured borrowers. 
 We may acquire bridge loans secured by first lien mortgages on a property to borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of a property, or other short-term liquidity needs. The typical borrower under a bridge loan has usually identified an undervalued asset that has been under-managed and/or is located in a recovering market. If the market in which the asset is located fails to recover according to the borrower s projections, or if the borrower fails to improve the quality of the asset s management and/or the value of the asset, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the asset to satisfy the bridge loan, and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure. 
 In addition, borrowers usually use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay a bridge loan. A bridge loan therefore is subject to the risk of a borrower s inability to obtain permanent financing to repay the bridge loan. Bridge loans are also subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud, losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance. In the event of any default under bridge loans held by us, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the bridge loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect to our bridge loans, the value of our company and the price of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected. 
 We purchase securities backed by subprime or alternative documentation residential loans, which are subject to increased risks. 
 We own non-agency RMBS backed by collateral pools of mortgage loans that have been originated using underwriting standards that are less restrictive than those used in underwriting prime mortgage loans. These lower standards include mortgage loans made to borrowers having imperfect or impaired credit histories, mortgage loans where the amount of the loan at origination is 80 or more of the value of the mortgaged property, mortgage loans made to borrowers with low credit scores, mortgage loans made to borrowers who have other debt that represents a large portion of their income and mortgage loans made to borrowers whose income is not required to be disclosed or verified. Due to economic conditions, including increased interest rates and lower home prices, as well as aggressive lending practices, subprime mortgage loans have in recent periods experienced increased rates of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss, and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher, and that may be substantially higher, than those experienced by mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner. Thus, because of the higher delinquency rates and losses associated with subprime mortgage loans and alternative documentation Alt-A mortgage loans, the performance of non-agency RMBS backed by subprime mortgage loans and Alt-A mortgage loans that we acquire could be correspondingly adversely affected, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. 
 We may acquire and sell from time to time residential loans, including non-QM loans, which may subject us to legal, regulatory and other risks, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 We may from time to time acquire residential loans, including residential loans sometimes referred to as non-qualified mortgages or non-QMs that will not have the benefit of enhanced legal protections otherwise available in connection with the origination of residential loans to a more restrictive credit standard than just determining a borrower s ability to repay, as further described below. 
 The ownership of residential loans, including non-QMs, subjects us to legal, regulatory and other risks, including those arising under federal consumer protection laws and regulations designed to regulate residential loan underwriting and 
 31 

Table of Content s 

 originators lending processes, standards and disclosures to borrowers. These laws and regulations include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s CFPB TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule (also referred to as TRID ), the ability-to-repay rules ATR Rules under the Truth-in-Lending Act and qualified mortgage regulations, in addition to various federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to discourage predatory lending practices by residential loan originators. The ATR Rules specify the characteristics of a qualified mortgage and two levels of presumption of compliance with the ATR Rules: a safe harbor and a rebuttable presumption for higher priced loans. The safe harbor under the ATR Rules applies to a covered transaction that meets the definition of qualified mortgage and is not a higher-priced covered transaction. For any covered transaction that meets the definition of a qualified mortgage and is not a higher-priced covered transaction, the creditor or assignee will be deemed to have complied with the ability-to-repay requirement and, accordingly, will be conclusively presumed to have made a good faith and reasonable determination of the consumer s ability to repay. Creditors or assignees will have the benefit of a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the applicable ATR Rules if they have complied with the qualified mortgage characteristics of the ATR Rules other than the residential loan being higher-priced in excess of certain thresholds. Non-QMs, such as residential loans with a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 43 , are among the loan products that we may acquire that do not constitute qualified mortgages and, accordingly, do not have the benefit of either a safe harbor from liability under the ATR Rules or a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ATR Rules. Application of certain standards set forth in the ATR Rules is highly subjective and subject to interpretive uncertainties. As a result, a court may determine that a residential loan did not meet the standard or test even if the originator reasonably believed such standard or test had been satisfied. Failure of residential loan originators or servicers to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us, as an assignee or purchaser of these loans (or as an investor in securities backed by these loans), to monetary penalties assessed by the CFPB through its administrative enforcement authority and by mortgagors through a private right of action against lenders or as a defense to foreclosure, including by recoupment or setoff of finance charges and fees collected, and could result in rescission of the affected residential loans, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Such risks may be higher in connection with the acquisition of non-QMs. Borrowers under non-QMs may be more likely to challenge the analysis conducted under the ATR Rules by lenders. Even if a borrower does not succeed in the challenge, additional costs may be incurred in connection with challenging and defending such claims, which may be more costly in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions than in non-judicial foreclosure jurisdictions, and there may be more of a likelihood such claims are made since the borrower is already exposed to the judicial system to process the foreclosure. 
 In addition, when certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries sell, finance or sponsor securitizations of residential loans, such subsidiaries may make representations and warranties to the purchaser, the financing provider or to other third parties regarding, among other things, certain characteristics of those assets, including characteristics sought to be verified through underwriting and due diligence efforts. In the event of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to any asset, such subsidiaries may be obligated to repurchase that asset or pay damages or remove that asset from the borrowing base, as applicable, which may result in a loss. Even if representations and warranties are made by counterparties from whom we acquired the loans, they may not parallel the representations and warranties our subsidiaries make or may otherwise not protect us from losses, including, for example, due to the fact that the counterparty may be insolvent or otherwise unable to make a payment at the time of a claim against such counterparty for damages for a breach of a representation or warranty. 
 The residential loans that we may acquire, and that underlie the RMBS we acquire, are subject to risks particular to investments secured by mortgage loans on residential property. These risks are heightened because we may purchase non-performing loans. 
 Residential loans are secured by single-family residential property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property typically is dependent upon the income and/or assets of the borrower. A number of factors may impair borrowers abilities to repay their loans, including: 
 changes in the borrowers income or assets; 
 acts of God, including, without limitation, earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other natural disasters and global climate change, which may result in uninsured losses; 
 acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of such events; 
 adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions; 
 changes in governmental laws and regulations, including fiscal policies, zoning ordinances and environmental legislation and the related costs of compliance; 
 costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions; and 
 the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses.

 In the event of any default under a residential loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the price we paid for the loan and any accrued interest of the mortgage loan plus advances made, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. In the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. Additionally, foreclosure on a mortgage loan could subject us to greater concentration of the risks of the residential real estate markets and risks related to the ownership and management of real property. 
 We may acquire non-agency RMBS, which are backed by residential property but, in contrast to agency RMBS, their principal and interest are not guaranteed by federally chartered entities such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and, in the case of the Government National Mortgage Association, the U.S. government. Our investments in RMBS are subject to the risks of default, foreclosure timeline extension, fraud, home price depreciation and unfavorable modification of loan principal amount, interest rate and amortization of principal accompanying the underlying residential loans. To the extent that assets underlying our investments are concentrated geographically, by property type or in certain other respects, we may be subject to certain of the foregoing risks to a greater extent. In the event of defaults on the residential loans that underlie our investments in agency RMBS and the exhaustion of any underlying or any additional credit support, we may not realize our anticipated return on our investments and we may incur a loss on these investments. 
 Our inability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted residential loans could increase our cost of doing business and/or diminish our expected return on investments. 
 Our ability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted residential loans and liquidate the underlying real property plays a critical role in our valuation of, and expected return on, those investments. There are a variety of factors that may inhibit our ability to foreclose upon a residential loan and liquidate the real property within the time frames we model as part of our valuation process. These factors include, without limitation: federal, state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential loan foreclosures and that serve to delay the foreclosure process; Home Affordable Modification Program and other programs that require specific procedures to be followed to explore the refinancing of a mortgage loan prior to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding; and continued declines in real estate values and sustained high levels of unemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and place additional pressure on the already overburdened judicial and administrative systems. 
 Prepayment rates may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio. 
 The value of our investment portfolio is affected by prepayment rates on our mortgage assets. In many cases, borrowers are not prohibited from making prepayments on their mortgage loans. Prepayment rates are influenced by changes in interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic and other factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, housing and financial markets and relative interest rates on fixed rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans ARMs ). Consequently, prepayment rates cannot be predicted. 
 We generally receive principal payments that are made on our mortgage assets, including residential loans underlying the agency RMBS or the non-agency RMBS that we acquire. When borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, it results in prepayments that are faster than expected. Faster than expected prepayments could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to recoup our cost of certain investments purchased at a premium over par value, including in the following ways: 
 We may purchase RMBS that have a higher interest rate than the prevailing market interest rate at the time. In exchange for this higher interest rate, we may pay a premium over the par value to acquire our mortgage asset. In accordance with GAAP, we may amortize this premium over the estimated term of our mortgage asset. If our mortgage asset is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date, however, we may be required to expense the allocable portion of the premium at the time of the prepayment. 
 Prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, making it unlikely that we would be able to reinvest the proceeds of any prepayment in mortgage assets of similar quality and terms (including yield). If we are unable to invest in similar mortgage assets, we would be adversely affected. 
 While we seek to minimize prepayment risk to the extent practical, in selecting investments we must balance prepayment risk against other risks and the potential returns of each investment. No strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risk.

 Interest rate mismatches between our agency RMBS backed by ARMs and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of these assets may reduce our net interest income and cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. 
 To the extent that we invest in agency RMBS backed by ARMs, we may finance these investments with borrowings that have interest rates that adjust more frequently than the interest rates of those agency RMBS or the ARMs that back those RMBS. Accordingly, if short-term interest rates increase, our borrowing costs may increase faster than the interest rates on agency RMBS backed by ARMs adjust. As a result, in a period of rising interest rates, we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss. In most cases, the interest rates on our agency RMBS and on our borrowings will not be identical, thereby potentially creating an interest rate mismatch between our investments and our borrowings. While the historical spread between relevant short-term interest rate indices has been relatively stable, there have been periods when the spread between these indices was volatile. During periods of changing interest rates, these interest rate index mismatches could reduce our net income or produce a net loss, and adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. 
 In addition, agency RMBS backed by ARMs are typically subject to lifetime interest rate caps which limit the amount that interest rates can increase through the maturity of the agency RMBS. However, our borrowings under repurchase agreements typically are not subject to similar restrictions. Accordingly, in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates, the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while caps could limit the interest rates on these types of agency RMBS. This problem is magnified for agency RMBS backed by ARMs that are not fully indexed. Further, some agency RMBS backed by ARMs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. As a result, we may receive less cash income on these types of agency RMBS than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings. These factors could reduce our net interest income and cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. 
 We may invest in distressed and non-performing commercial loans which could subject us to increased risks relative to performing loans, which may result in losses to us. 
 We may invest in distressed and non-performing commercial mortgage loans, which are subject to increased risks of loss. Such loans may be or become non-performing for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, because the underlying property is too highly leveraged or the borrower falls upon financial distress, in either case, resulting in the borrower being unable to meet its debt service obligations. Such loans may require a substantial amount of workout negotiations and/or restructuring, which may divert attention from other activities and may entail, among other things, a substantial reduction in the interest rate and a substantial write-down of the principal of the loan. Moreover, the ability to implement a successful restructuring entails a high degree of uncertainty, and we may not be able to implement any such restructuring on favorable terms or at all. 
 The financial or operating difficulties relating to the distressed or non-performing loan may never be overcome and may cause the borrower to become subject to bankruptcy or other similar administrative proceedings. In connection with any such proceeding, we may incur substantial or total losses on our investments and may become subject to certain additional potential liabilities that may exceed the value of our original investment therein. For example, under certain circumstances, a lender that has inappropriately exercised control over the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In addition, under certain circumstances, payments to us may be reclaimed if any such payment is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. 
 Alternatively, we may find it necessary or desirable to foreclose on one of these loans, and the foreclosure process may be lengthy and expensive. Borrowers or junior lenders may resist mortgage foreclosure actions by asserting numerous claims, counterclaims and defenses against us. Any costs or delays involved in the effectuation of a foreclosure of the loan or a liquidation of the underlying property, or defending challenges brought after the completion of a foreclosure, will further reduce the proceeds and thus increase our loss. 
 Some of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of these investments. 
 Some of our portfolio investments are in the form of positions or securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these investments quarterly at fair value, as determined in accordance with GAAP, which include consideration of unobservable inputs. Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. The value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. 
 34 

Table of Content s 

 We may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets. 
 A decline in the fair value of our assets would require us to recognize an unrealized loss against earnings for those assets that are recorded at fair value through earnings, or may trigger an impairment, credit loss or other charge against earnings under applicable GAAP for those assets that are not recorded at fair value through earnings if we expect that the carrying value of those assets will not be recoverable. Subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains depending on the actual proceeds received. 
 Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may purchase or acquire. 
 We may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from properties we own. Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. 
 The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner s ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt investments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 The presence of hazardous substances on a property we own may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 We invest in commercial properties subject to net leases, which could subject us to losses. 
 We invest in commercial properties subject to net leases, including the Master Lease Portfolio. Typically, net leases require the tenants to pay substantially all of the operating costs associated with the properties. As a result, the value of, and income from, investments in commercial properties subject to net leases will depend, in part, upon the ability of the applicable tenant to meet its obligations to maintain the property under the terms of the net lease. If a tenant fails or becomes unable to so maintain a property, we will be subject to all risks associated with owning the underlying real estate. Under many net leases, however, the owner of the property retains certain obligations with respect to the property, including, among other things, the responsibility for maintenance and repair of the property, to provide adequate parking, maintenance of common areas and compliance with other affirmative covenants in the lease. If we were to fail to meet any such obligations, the applicable tenant could abate rent or terminate the applicable lease, which could result in a loss of our capital invested in, and anticipated profits from, the property. 
 We expect that some commercial properties subject to net leases in which we invest generally will be occupied by a single tenant and, therefore, the success of these investments will be materially dependent on the financial stability of each such tenant. A default of any such tenant on its lease payments to us would cause us to lose the revenue from the property and cause us to have to find an alternative source of revenue to meet any mortgage payment and prevent a foreclosure if the property is subject to a mortgage. In the event of a default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-letting our property. If a lease is terminated, we may also incur significant losses to make the leased premises ready for another tenant and experience difficulty or a significant delay in re-leasing such property. 
 In addition, net leases typically have longer lease terms and, thus, there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years. 
 We may acquire these investments through sale-leaseback transactions, which involve the purchase of a property and the leasing of such property back to the seller thereof. If we enter into a sale-leaseback transaction, we will seek to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a true lease for U.S. federal income tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, we cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS will not challenge such characterization. In the event that any such sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed. If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification asset tests or income tests and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which might also cause us to fail to meet the REIT distribution requirement for a taxable year.

 Investments outside the U.S. that are denominated in foreign currencies subject us to foreign currency risks and to the uncertainty of foreign laws and markets, which may adversely affect our distributions and our REIT status. 
 Our investments outside the U.S. denominated in foreign currencies subject us to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in exchange rates of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollars may affect our income and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders equity. In addition, these investments subject us to risks of multiple and conflicting tax laws and regulations, and other laws and regulations that may make foreclosure and the exercise of other remedies in the case of default more difficult or costly compared to U.S. assets, and political and economic instability abroad, any of which factors could adversely affect our receipt of returns on and distributions from these investments. 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to value a REIT s foreign assets may be considered changes in the value of the REIT s assets. These changes may adversely affect our status as a REIT. Further, bank accounts in foreign currency which are not considered cash or cash equivalents may adversely affect our status as a REIT. 
 We invest in equity interests in commercial real estate assets, which subjects us to the general risks of owning commercial real estate. 
 We acquire and manage equity interests in commercial real estate assets. The economic performance and value of these investments can be adversely affected by many factors that are generally applicable to most real estate, including the following: 
 changes in the national, regional, local and international economic climate; 
 local conditions, such as oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the areas in which they are located; 
 competition from other available space; 
 the attractiveness of the real estate to tenants; 
 increases in operating costs if these costs cannot be passed through to tenants; 
 the financial condition of tenants and the ability to collect rent from tenants; 
 vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically renovate, repair and re-let space; 
 changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; 
 changes in zoning laws and taxation, government regulation and potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; 
 acts of God, including, without limitation, earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other natural disasters, global climate change, or acts of war or terrorism, in each case which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; and 
 decreases in the underlying value of real estate. 
 Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in commercial real estate assets (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the asset. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary any investments in commercial real estate assets promptly in response to economic or other conditions would be limited. This relative illiquidity could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of such investments. The value of our equity investments in commercial real estate assets could decrease in the future. 
 We face risks associated with acquisitions of commercial real estate assets. 
 Our acquisition of equity interests in commercial real estate assets is subject to, and the success of those assets may be adversely affected by, various risks, including those described below: 
 we may be unable to meet required closing conditions; 
 we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; 
 acquired assets may fail to perform as expected; 
 our estimates of the costs of repositioning or renovating acquired commercial real estate assets may be inaccurate; 
 we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for acquired commercial real estate assets; 
 36 

Table of Content s 

 acquisitions may be located in markets where we and our Manager have a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; 
 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions of commercial real estate assets into our existing operations and, therefore, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and 
 we may acquire equity interests in commercial real estate assets through a joint venture, and such investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority and reliance upon a co-venturer s financial condition. In addition, if we co-invest with affiliates of our Manager, we may be obligated to pay fees to such affiliates and would be subject to a variety of conflicts of interest with such affiliates, including conflicts similar to those described under the section captioned Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager. 
 We make equity investments in commercial real estate assets subject to both known and unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse to the seller thereof. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us arising from our ownership of those assets, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect us. Unknown liabilities with respect to commercial real estate assets may include: 
 claims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising from dealing with the former owners of the assets; 
 liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; 
 claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the assets; and 
 liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination. 
 Government housing regulations may limit the opportunities at the affordable housing communities in which we invest, and failure to comply with resident qualification requirements may result in financial penalties or loss of benefits. 
 We own, and may acquire additional, equity interests in affordable housing communities and other properties that benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to individuals with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are typically administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax credits or rental assistance payments to property owners. As a condition of the receipt of assistance under these programs, the properties must comply with various requirements, which typically limit rents to pre-approved amounts and impose restrictions on resident incomes. Failure to comply with these requirements and restrictions may result in financial penalties or loss of benefits. In addition, we will typically need to obtain the approval of HUD in order to acquire or dispose of a significant interest in or manage a HUD-assisted property. We may not always receive such approval. 
 We are subject to the general risks of owning properties relating to the healthcare industry. 
 We own, and may acquire additional, equity interests in properties relating to the healthcare industry, including the Medical Office Portfolio. The economic performance and value of these properties and of some or all of the tenants/operators of such properties could be adversely affected by many factors that are generally applicable to properties relating to the healthcare industry, including the following: 
 adverse trends in healthcare provider operations, such as changes in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services, changes in third party reimbursement policies, significant unused capacity in certain areas, which has created substantial competition for patients among healthcare providers in those areas, increased expense for uninsured patients, increased competition among healthcare providers, increased liability insurance expense, continued pressure by private and governmental payors to reduce payments to providers of services and increased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by federal and state authorities and private insurers; 
 extensive healthcare regulation, changes in enforcement policies with respect to such regulation and potential changes in the regulatory framework of the healthcare industry; and 
 significant legal actions brought against tenants/operators that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities.

 We have sponsored, and purchased the more junior securities of, CLOs and such instruments involve significant risks, including that these securities receive distributions from the CLO only if the CLO generates enough income to first pay all the investors holding senior tranches and all CLO expenses. 
 We have sponsored, and purchased the junior securities of, CLOs, and in the future we may sponsor, and purchase the more junior securities of, additional CLOs. In CLOs, investors purchase specific tranches, or slices, of debt instruments that are secured or backed by a pool of loans. The CLO debt classes have a specific seniority structure and priority of payments. The most junior securities along with the preferred shares of a CLO are generally retained by the sponsor of the CLO and are usually entitled to all of the income generated by the pool of loans after the payment of debt service on all the more senior classes of debt and the payment of all expenses. Defaults on the pool of loans therefore first affect the most junior tranches. The subordinate tranches of CLO debt may also experience a lower recovery and greater risk of loss, including risk of deferral or non-payment of interest than more senior tranches of the CLO debt because they bear the bulk of defaults from the loans held in the CLO and serve to protect the other, more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances. Despite the protection provided by the subordinate tranches, even more senior CLO tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults, increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches, decline in market value due to market anticipation of defaults and aversion to CLO securities as a class. Further, the transaction documents relating to the issuance of CLO securities may impose eligibility criteria on the assets of the CLO, restrict the ability of the CLO s sponsor to trade investments and impose certain portfolio-wide asset quality requirements. Finally, the credit risk retention rules of the SEC impose a retention requirement of 5 of the issued debt classes by the sponsor of the CLO. These criteria, restrictions and requirements may limit the ability of the CLO s sponsor (or collateral manager) to maximize returns on the CLO securities. 
 In addition, CLOs are not actively traded and are relatively illiquid investments and volatility in CLO trading markets may cause the value of these investments to decline. The market value of CLO securities may be affected by, among other things, changes in the market value of the underlying loans held by the CLO, changes in the distributions on the underlying loans, defaults and recoveries on the underlying loans, capital gains and losses on the underlying losses (or foreclosure assets), prepayments on the underlying loans and the availability, prices and interest rate of underlying loans. Furthermore, the leveraged nature of each subordinated tranche may magnify the adverse impact on such class of changes in the value of the lo ans, changes in the distributions on the loans, defaults and recoveries on the loans, capital gains and losses on the loans (or foreclosure assets), prepayment on loans and availability, price and interest rates of the loans. 
 Our CLOs include certain interest coverage tests, overcollateralization coverage tests or other tests that, if not met, may result in a change in the priority of distributions, which may result in the reduction or elimination of distributions to the subordinate debt and equity tranches until the tests have been met or certain senior classes of securities have been paid in full. For example, even if no loan in the pool experiences a default, an appraisal reduction of a loan in the pool may cause the pool of loans in the applicable CLO not to meet certain of these test. Accordingly, if such tests are not satisfied, we, as holders of the subordinate debt and equity interests in the applicable CLO, may experience a significant reduction in our cash flow from those interests. 
 Moreover, the reinvestment and replenishment period in one or more of our CLOs may be nearing the end of its term. Once the reinvestment and replenishment period has ended any repayments of a loan in the applicable CLO will require us to pay down the most senior debt in such CLO resulting in an increase in our cost of funds. 
 Furthermore, if any CLO that we sponsor or in which we hold interests fails to meet certain tests relevant to the most senior debt issued and outstanding by the CLO issuer, an event of default may occur under that CLO. If that occurs, (i) if we were serving as manager of such CLO, our ability to manage the CLO may be terminated and (ii) our ability to attempt to cure any defaults in such CLO may be limited, which would increase the likelihood of a reduction or elimination of cash flow and returns to us in such CLO for an indefinite time. 
 Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and liquidity and disputes between us and our joint venture partners. 
 We may make investments through joint ventures. Such joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present when we make investments without partners, including the following: 
 we may not have exclusive control over the investment or the joint venture, which may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest and could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as with respect to acquisitions or dispositions; 
 joint venture agreements often restrict the transfer of a partner s interest or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire and/or on advantageous terms; 
 38 

Table of Content s 

 joint venture agreements may contain buy-sell provisions pursuant to which one partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between buying the other partner s interest or selling its interest to that partner; 
 a partner may, at any time, have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals; 
 a partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives, including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act; 
 a partner may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions or may become bankrupt, which may mean that we and any other remaining partners generally would remain liable for the joint venture s liabilities; 
 our relationships with our partners are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the applicable joint venture agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to own or operate the interests or investments underlying such relationship or may need to purchase such interests or investments at a premium to the market price to continue ownership; 
 disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent our Manager and our officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business and could result in subjecting the investments owned by the joint venture to additional risk; or 
 we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of a partner, and the activities of a partner could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act, even though we do not control the joint venture. 
 Any of the above may subject us to liabilities in excess of those contemplated and adversely affect the value of our joint venture investments. 
 Risks Related to Our Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment or such benefits may take longer to realize than expected. 
 The success of our prior acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from successfully integrating the Infrastructure Lending Segment with our company. The combination of this business with ours is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the Infrastructure Lending Segment with the rest of our company. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude us from realizing all of the potential benefits we expect to realize with respect to the acquisition. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the integration may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of business relationships and diversion of management s attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties relating to the integration process include, among others: 
 managing a new area of business; 
 the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters and potential disruption associated with the acquisition; 
 maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; 
 integrating two unique business cultures; 
 the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; 
 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; 
 coordinating geographically separate organizations; 
 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; 
 unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; 
 managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration process; and 
 suffering losses if we do not experience the anticipated benefits of the transaction.

 For our prior acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment to be successful, we must retain and motivate key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm our business and financial results. In addition, the success of our prior acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment depends, in part, on our ability to leverage the capabilities of Lotus Infrastructure Partners and Starwood Oil and Gas. 
 The success of our prior acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment largely depends on the skills, experience, industry contacts and continued efforts of management and other key personnel. As a result, for our prior acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees. Employees from the Infrastructure Lending Segment may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us until or after strategies relating to the Infrastructure Lending Segment are executed. In addition, the marketplace for infrastructure debt professionals is highly competitive and other infrastructure debt providers may seek to recruit our executives and other key employees. These circumstances may adversely affect our ability to retain executives of the Infrastructure Lending Segment and other key personnel. We also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals, which effort may be adversely affected as a result of the uncertainty and difficulties with integrating the Infrastructure Lending Segment with the rest of our company. If we are unable to retain executives and other key employees, the roles and responsibilities of such executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees, which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to integrate the Infrastructure Lending Segment with the rest of our company or otherwise pursue business opportunities. Moreover, because the marketplace for infrastructure debt professionals is highly competitive, we may not be able to replace departing employees on a timely basis or at all without incurring significant expense. 
 In addition, we leverage the existing capabilities of Lotus Infrastructure Partners (formerly Starwood Energy Group) and Starwood Oil and Gas, affiliates of our Manager, with respect to our existing and future infrastructure debt investments, and our success depends, in part, on our ability to do so. Neither Lotus Infrastructure Partners or Starwood Oil and Gas has an obligation to provide any services to us, and so our ability to access Lotus Infrastructure Partners and Starwood Oil and Gas existing capabilities is dependent on our ongoing relationship with our Manager and Starwood Capital Group. See Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager. Accordingly, we may not continue to have access to Lotus Infrastructure Partners or Starwood Oil and Gas and their respective officers and key personnel. 
 We are subject to the risks of investing in project finance investments, many of which are outside our control, and that may negatively impact our business and financial results. 
 We are subject to the risks of investing in project finance investments. Infrastructure loans are subject to the risk of default, foreclosure and loss, and the risk of loss may be greater than similar risks associated with loans made on other types of assets. The loan structure for project finance relies primarily on the underlying project s cash flows for repayment, with the project s assets, rights and interests, together with the equity in the project company, typically pledged as collateral. Accordingly, the ability of the project company to repay a project finance loan is dependent upon the successful development, construction and/or operation of such project rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the project company. Moreover, the loans are typically non-recourse or limited recourse to the project sponsor, and the project company, as a special purpose entity, typically has no assets other than the project. Accordingly, if the project s cash flows are reduced or are otherwise less than projected, the project company s ability to repay the loan will likely be impaired. The Infrastructure Lending Segment has made and will continue to make certain estimates regarding project cash flows during the underwriting of its investments. These estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. A project s cash flows can be adversely affected by, among other things: 
 if the project involves new construction, 
 cost overruns, 
 delays in completion, 
 availability of land, building materials, energy, raw materials and transportation, 
 availability of work force, management personnel and reliable contractors, and 
 natural disasters (fire, drought, flood, earthquake, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic), global climate change, war, civil unrest and strikes affecting contractors, suppliers or markets;

 In the event of any default under a project finance loan, we bear the risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the principal and accrued interest of the loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of the bankruptcy of a project company, our investment will be deemed to be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession and our contractual rights may be unenforceable under state or other applicable law. Foreclosure proceedings against a project can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed investment. 
 The investment portfolio of our Infrastructure Lending Segment is concentrated in the power industry, which subjects the portfolio to more risks than if the investments were more diversified. 
 Many of the investments in the portfolio of our Infrastructure Lending Segment are focused in the power industry, including thermal power and renewable power. If there is a downturn in the U.S. or global power industry generally, the applicable infrastructure investments may default or not perform in accordance with expectations. In addition to the factors described above regarding the general risks of investing in project finance, the power industry and its subsectors can be adversely affected by, among other factors: 
 market pricing for electricity; 
 change in creditworthiness of the offtaker; 
 unforeseen capital expenditures; 
 government regulation and policy change; and 
 world and regional events, politics and economic conditions. 
 In addition to investments focused in the power industry, our portfolio also contains investments related to projects in the midstream oil and gas industry, which also subjects us to certain risks inherent in the midstream oil and gas industry. 
 Loans to power projects or midstream oil and gas projects may be adversely affected if production from the projects declines. Such declines may be caused by various factors, including, as applicable, decreased access to capital or loss of economic incentive to complete a project or continue to operate a project, depletion of resources, catastrophic events affecting production, labor difficulties, political events, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, failure to obtain necessary permits, unscheduled outages, unanticipated expenses, inability to successfully carry out new construction or acquisitions, import or export supply and demand disruptions or increased competition from alternative energy sources. 
 The default of one or more of the infrastructure loans as a result of a downturn within the energy industry generally, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may have difficulty meeting our obligations on the unfunded commitments of the infrastructure loans, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Under certain circumstances, we may find it difficult to meet our remaining funding obligations with the existing infrastructure loans, or with respect to future infrastructure loans, from our ordinary operations. In such situations, in order to meet our then-existing funding obligations, we may be required to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions; (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms; or (iii) fund the infrastructure loans with amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the funding obligations with respect to the infrastructure loans may hinder our ability to grow, which could have a material 
 41 

Table of Content s 

 adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event that we are unable to meet our funding obligations with respect to one or more infrastructure loans, we would be in breach of such loan(s), which could damage our reputation and could result in a lawsuit being brought by the project company or others, which could result in substantial costs and divert our attention and resources. 
 The power and oil and gas industries are subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely impact the business and financial performance of the projects to which our infrastructure loans relate. 
 The projects to which our infrastructure loans relate, which are focused in the power industry and oil and gas industry, are subject to significant and extensive federal, international, state and local governmental regulation, including how facilities are constructed, maintained and operated, environmental and safety controls, and the prices they may charge for the products and services they provide. Various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and the permits issued under them, and violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future that likely would increase compliance costs, which could adversely affect the business and financial performance of the projects. Any of the foregoing could result in a default on one or more of our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We generally are not able to control the projects underlying our infrastructure loans. 
 Although the covenants in the financing documentation relating to the infrastructure loans generally restrict certain actions that may be taken by project companies (including restrictions on making equity distributions and incurring additional indebtedness), we generally are not able to control the projects underlying our infrastructure loans. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the project company may make business decisions with which we disagree or that the project company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests. 
 Operation of a project underlying an infrastructure loan involves significant risks and hazards that may impair the project company s ability to repay the loan, resulting in its default, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
 The ongoing operation of a project underlying any of our infrastructure loans involves risks that include, among other things, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events. In addition to natural risks such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, lightning, wildfires, hurricanes, wind, global climate change and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure, acts of terrorism or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events are inherent risks in the operation of a project. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. Operation of a project also involves risks that the operator will be unable to transport its product to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of a project, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time. Unplanned outages typically increase operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce revenues. While a project typically maintains insurance, obtains warranties from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover the lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should the project experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors. A project s inability to operate its assets efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow could have a material adverse effect on the project company s ability to repay the loan, which could result in its default. A default on one or more of the infrastructure loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Loans to companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production may be exposed to production risk and to commodity price risk. 
 Certain of the loans in the Infrastructure Lending segment have been, or are expected to be, made to companies that engage in oil and gas exploration and production. These companies generate revenue, and our loans are expected to be repaid, from a combination of (i) sales of oil and gas under contracts pursuant to which third parties rather than our borrowers bear most of the risk of commodity price fluctuation and (ii) sales of oil and gas in the open commodity markets at then-prevailing prices. To the extent production from the underlying oil and gas wells is lower than forecasted, there is non-performance by (or a bankruptcy or insolvency of) the counterparty under a commodity contract, or the spot market price for the commodities decreases, the borrowers revenues, and ability to repay our loan, may be negatively affected.

 Tax considerations relating to the Infrastructure Lending Segment may reduce our net proceeds received from interest payments. 
 The Infrastructure Lending Segment is held in one or more domestic or foreign subsidiaries in order to facilitate our financing of the acquisition of that portfolio and aid in the maintenance of our status as a REIT under the Code. The domestic subsidiary that initially acquired a significant portion of the pre-existing investment portfolio of the Infrastructure Lending Segment is disregarded as to our company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and we have elected to have other foreign and domestic subsidiaries that hold or will hold a portion of the pre-existing portfolio each treated as a TRS. With respect to newly originated infrastructure loans, we will hold such loans either in a subsidiary that is disregarded as to our company for U.S. federal income tax purposes or in foreign or domestic TRSs that are subject to U.S. taxation under the general rules applicable to such corporations. See Risks Related to Taxation as a REIT. 
 Certain interest payments to us or to any such domestic or foreign subsidiary made by the underlying borrowers with respect to the infrastructure loans may be subject to withholding taxes in the jurisdictions in which the related facilities or borrowers are located, which would reduce the net proceeds from such payments that are received by us. 
 Risks Related to Our Investing and Servicing Segment 
 The business activities of our Investing and Servicing Segment, particularly our special servicing business, expose us to certain risks. 
 In our Investing and Servicing Segment, we derive a substantial portion of our cash flows from the special servicing of pools of commercial mortgage loans. As special servicer, we typically receive fees based upon the outstanding balance of the loans that are being specially serviced by us. The balance of loans in special servicing where we act as special servicer could decline significantly and as such our servicing fees could likewise decline materially. The special servicing industry is highly competitive, and our inability to compete successfully with other firms to maintain our existing servicing portfolio and obtain future servicing opportunities could have a material and adverse impact on our future cash flows and results of operations. Because the right to appoint the special servicer for securitized mortgage loans generally resides with the holder of the controlling class position in the relevant trust and may migrate to holders of different classes of securities as additional losses are realized, our ability to maintain our existing servicing rights and obtain future servicing opportunities may require, in many cases, the acquisition of additional CMBS. Accordingly, our ability to compete effectively may depend, in part, on the availability of additional debt or equity capital to fund these purchases. To maintain our existing servicing rights and to obtain future assignments, in certain instances our special servicer entity has entered and in the future will enter into a fee sharing arrangement with the holder of the controlling class. Additionally, our existing servicing portfolio is subject to run off, meaning that mortgage loans serviced by us may be prepaid prior to maturity, refinanced with a mortgage not serviced by us, liquidated through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other liquidation processes or repaid through standard amortization of principal, resulting in lower servicing fees and/or lower returns on the subordinated securities owned by us. Improving economic conditions and property prices and declines in interest rates and greater availability of mortgage financing could reduce the incidence of assets going into special servicing and reduce our revenues from special servicing, including as a result of lower fees under new arrangements. The fair value of our servicing rights may decrease under the foregoing circumstances, resulting in losses. 
 In connection with the special servicing of mortgage loans, a special servicer may, at the direction of the directing certificateholder, generally take actions with respect to the specially serviced mortgage loans that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the more senior classes of CMBS. We may hold subordinated CMBS and we may or may not be the directing holder in any CMBS transaction in which we also act as special servicer. We may have conflicts of interest in exercising our rights as holder of subordinated classes of CMBS and in owning the entity that also acts as the special servicer for such transactions. It is possible that we, acting as the directing certificateholder for a CMBS transaction, may direct special servicer actions that conflict with the interests of certain other classes of the CMBS issued in that transaction. The special servicer is not permitted to take actions that are prohibited by law or that violate the applicable servicing standard or the terms of the applicable CMBS documentation or the applicable mortgage loan documentation, and we are subject to the risk of claims asserted by mortgage loan borrowers and the holders of other classes of CMBS that we have violated applicable law or, if applicable, the servicing standard and our other obligations under such CMBS documentation or mortgage loan documentation, as a result of actions we may take. 
 The conduit operations in our Investing and Servicing Segment are subject to volatile market conditions and significant competition. In addition, the conduit business may suffer losses as a result of ineffective or inadequate hedges and credit issues. 
 43

 The business activities in our Investing and Servicing Segment are subject to an evolving regulatory environment that may affect certain aspects of these activities. 
 In our Investing and Servicing Segment, we acquire subordinated securities issued by and act as special servicer for securitizations. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), various federal agencies have promulgated a rule that generally requires issuers in securitizations to retain 5 of the risk associated with the securities. While the rule as adopted generally allows the purchase of the CMBS B-Piece by a party not affiliated with the issuer to satisfy the risk retention requirement, current CMBS B-Pieces are generally not large enough to fully satisfy the 5 requirement. Accordingly, buyers of B-Pieces such as us may be required to purchase larger B-Pieces, potentially reducing returns on such investments. Furthermore, any such B-Pieces purchased by a party (such as us) unaffiliated with the issuer generally cannot be transferred for a period of five years following the closing date of the securitization or hedged against credit risk. These restrictions may reduce our liquidity and could potentially reduce our returns on such investments. 
 The mortgage loan servicing activities of our Investing and Servicing Segment are subject to a still evolving set of regulations, including regulations being promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, various governmental authorities have increased their investigative focus on the activities of mortgage loan servicers. As a result, we may have to spend additional resources and devote additional management time to address any regulatory concerns, which may reduce the resources available to grow our business. In addition, if we fail to operate the servicing activities of our Investing and Servicing Segment in compliance with existing and future regulations, our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 The risks of investment in subordinated CMBS are magnified in the case of our Investing and Servicing Segment, where the principal payments received by the CMBS trust are made in priority to the higher rated securities. 
 CMBS are subject to the various risks that relate to the pool of underlying commercial mortgage loans and any other assets in which the CMBS represents an interest. In addition, CMBS are subject to additional risks arising from the geographic, property type and other types of concentrations in the pool of underlying commercial mortgage loans, which risks are magnified by the subordinated nature of the CMBS in which we invest in our Investing and Servicing Segment. In the event of defaults on the mortgage loans in the CMBS trusts, we bear a risk of loss on our related subordinated CMBS to the extent of deficiencies between the value of the collateral and the principal, accrued interest and unpaid fees and expenses on the mortgage loans, which may be offset to some extent by the special servicing fees received by us on those mortgage loans. The yield to maturity on the CMBS depends largely upon the price paid for the CMBS, which are generally sold at a discount at issuance and trade at even steeper discounts in the secondary markets. Further, the yield to maturity on CMBS depends, in significant part, upon the rate and timing of principal payments on the underlying mortgage loans, including both voluntary prepayments, if permitted, and involuntary prepayments, such as prepayments resulting from casualty or condemnation, defaults and liquidations or repurchases upon breaches of representations and warranties or document defects. Any changes in the weighted average lives of CMBS may adversely affect yield on the CMBS. Prepayments resulting in a shortening of weighted average lives of CMBS may be made at a time of low interest rates when we may be unable to reinvest the resulting payment of principal on the CMBS at a rate comparable to that being earned on the CMBS, while delays and extensions resulting in a lengthening of those weighted average lives may occur at a time of high interest rates when we may have been able to reinvest scheduled principal payments at higher rates. 
 The exercise of remedies and successful realization of liquidation proceeds relating to commercial mortgage loans underlying CMBS may be highly dependent on our performance as special servicer. We attempt to underwrite investments on a loss-adjusted basis, which projects a certain level of performance. However, this underwriting may not accurately predict the timing or magnitude of such losses. To the extent that this underwriting has incorrectly anticipated the timing or magnitude of losses, our business may be adversely affected. Some of the mortgage loans underlying the CMBS are in default and additional loans may default in the future. In the case of such defaults, cash flows of CMBS investments held by us may be adversely affected as any reduction in the mortgage payments or principal losses on liquidation of any mortgage loan may be applied to the class of CMBS securities relating to such defaulted loans that we hold. 
 The market value of CMBS could fluctuate materially as a result of various risks that are out of our control and may result in significant losses. 
 The market value of CMBS investments could fluctuate materially over time as the result of changes in mortgage spreads, treasury bond interest rates, capital market supply and demand factors, and many other factors that affect high-yield fixed income products. These factors are out of our control and could impair our ability to obtain short-term financing on the CMBS. CMBS investments, especially subordinated classes of CMBS, may have no, or only a limited, trading market. The financial markets have experienced and may continue to experience volatility and reduced liquidity, which may continue and reduce the market value of CMBS. Some or all of the CMBS, especially subordinated classes of CMBS, may be subject to restrictions on transfer and may be considered illiquid.

 Most of the assets in our Investing and Servicing Segment are held through, or are ownership interests in, entities subject to entity level or foreign taxes, which cannot be passed through to, or used by, our stockholders to reduce taxes they owe. 
 Most of the assets in our Investing and Servicing Segment are held through a TRS, which is subject to entity level taxes on income that it earns. Such taxes have materially increased the taxes paid by our TRSs. In addition, certain of the assets in our Investing and Servicing Segment include entities organized or assets located in foreign jurisdictions. Taxes that we or such entities pay in foreign jurisdictions may not be passed through to, or used by, our stockholders as a foreign tax credit or otherwise. 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements changed materially following our acquisition of LNR, as we became required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of CMBS pools in which we own the controlling class of subordinated securities and are considered the primary beneficiary. 
 Following our acquisition of LNR, we became required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain CMBS pools in which we own the controlling class of subordinated securities into our financial statements, even though the value of the subordinated securities may represent a small interest relative to the size of the pool. Under GAAP, companies are required to consolidate VIEs in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents, has a potentially significant interest in the entity and controls the entity s significant decisions. As a result of the foregoing, our financial statements are more complex and may be more difficult to understand than if we did not consolidate the CMBS pools. 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. We are subject to the business combination provisions of the MGCL that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of our then outstanding voting capital stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of our then outstanding voting capital stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between us and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of our voting capital stock and (ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting capital stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. These super-majority voting requirements do not apply if our common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. These provisions of the MGCL also do not apply to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person, provided that such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person). 
 The control share provisions of the MGCL provide that control shares of a Maryland corporation (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares, our officers and our personnel who are also our directors. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock, but this provision could be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. 
 The unsolicited takeover provisions of the MGCL permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement takeover defenses, some of which (for example, a classified board) we do not yet have. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. 
 45 

Table of Content s 

 Our authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in control. 
 Our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. In addition, our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. As a result, our board of directors may establish a series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 
 Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limits on our operations. 
 We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40 of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis. The term investment securities generally includes all securities except U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exemption from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. This requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries. In addition, the assets we and our subsidiaries may acquire are limited by the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which may adversely affect our performance. 
 If the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40 of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required either (i) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company or (ii) to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, either of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters. 
 We will determine whether an entity is a majority-owned subsidiary of our company. The Investment Company Act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The Investment Company Act defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat entities in which we own at least 50 of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the 40 test referenced above. We have not requested that the SEC or its staff approve our treatment of any entity as a majority-owned subsidiary, and neither has done so. If the SEC or its staff was to disagree with our treatment of one or more subsidiary entities as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40 test. 
 Many of our subsidiaries rely on the exclusion from the definition of an investment company under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which is available for entities primarily engaged in [the business of] . . . purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. This exclusion, as interpreted by the SEC staff, generally requires that at least 55 of a subsidiary s portfolio must be comprised of qualifying real estate assets and at least 80 of its portfolio must be comprised of qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets (and no more than 20 comprised of miscellaneous assets). In addition, certain of our subsidiaries in our Infrastructure Lending Segment may seek to rely, among other things, on the exceptions from the definition of investment company contained in Section 3(c)(5)(A) or Section 3(c)(5)(B) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(A) provides an exception from the definition of investment company for entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services. Section 3(c)(5)(B) excepts from the definition of investment company entities that are primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and prospective purchasers of specified merchandise, insurance or services. 
 As with other provisions of the Investment Company Act, including Section 3(c)(5)(C), reliance on Sections 3(c)(5)(A) and/or 3(c)(5)(B) is based in large part on the nature of the assets held by the relevant entities, and we have analyzed 
 46 

Table of Content s 

 the availability of Section 3(c)(5)(A) and/or 3(c)(5)(B) to certain of our subsidiaries in the Infrastructure Lending Segment based on guidance from the SEC staff on the types of assets that qualify an entity to rely on either exception. However, the SEC guidance is somewhat limited in this area and the SEC may in the future issue additional guidance through no action letters or otherwise and there can be no assurance that the assets of our subsidiaries in the Infrastructure Lending Segment will conform to such guidance. 
 In that regard, to the extent that any of such subsidiaries can no longer rely on the above Sections, such subsidiaries may be required to rely on other exceptions from the definition of investment company , such as Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), in which case we will need to treat our holdings therein as investment securities for purposes of the 40 test described above, or otherwise change the manner in which they conduct operations. Any such change could have an adverse effect on the performance of such subsidiaries and their ability to conduct their operations as currently contemplated. 
 In August 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. The laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of REITs, including the Division of Investment Management of the SEC providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, could change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required to (i) change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (ii) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (iii) register as an investment company (which, among other things, would require us to comply with the leverage constraints applicable to investment companies), any of which could negatively affect the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Rapid changes in the values of our real estate-related and other investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or exemption from the Investment Company Act. 
 If the market value or income potential of real estate-related or other investments declines as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment rates or other factors, including changes in carrying value of certain assets made in accordance with CECL, we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exemption from the Investment Company Act. Moreover, we may have to take similar action if the market value or income potential of any investment securities that we own increases. If the change in real estate or other asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of any non-qualifying assets that we may own. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the REIT and Investment Company Act considerations. 
 Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests. 
 Under Maryland law generally, a director s actions will be upheld if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from: 
 actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or 
 active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated. 
 Our charter authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws require us to indemnify each director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies. 
 Our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management. 
 Our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders.

 Ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. 
 In order for us to qualify as a REIT, no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year. Individuals for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some charitable trusts. To preserve our REIT qualification, our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock or more than 9.8 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. This ownership limitation could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.

 If we do not qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 We intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have not requested nor obtained a ruling from the IRS as to our REIT qualification. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our analysis of the character of our income and our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements as described below. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or in securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT requirements. 
 If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions made to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. 
 Ordinary dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some corporate dividends. 
 The maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividends payable by regular U.S. corporations to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates is currently 20 . Dividends payable by REITs generally are not eligible for that reduced rate. However, pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, such domestic stockholders may generally be allowed to deduct from their taxable income one-fifth of the ordinary dividends payable to them by REITs for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. This would amount to a reduction in the effective tax rate on REIT dividends as compared to prior law. To qualify for this deduction, the domestic stockholder receiving such dividend must hold the dividend-paying REIT shares for at least 46 days (taking into account certain special holding period rules) of the 91-day period beginning 45 days before the shares become ex-dividend, and cannot be under an obligation to make related payments with respect to a position in substantially similar or related property. 
 However, the more favorable rates that will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts or estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive as a federal income tax matter than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including ours. 
 REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to continue to execute our business plan. 
 We generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if 
 48 

Table of Content s 

 the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. 
 From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. For example, we may be required to accrue income from mortgage loans, MBS and other types of debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets, including in particular pursuant to requests by borrowers , in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic dislocations, for temporary interest deferrals or forbearances, or other modifications of their loans. We may also acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower, or we may be required to amend other debt investments, including in connection with the discontinuation of LIBOR. If the amendments to the outstanding debt are significant modifications under the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower, with gain recognized by us to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it prior to modification. In addition, we are generally required to recognize certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on our financial statements filed with the SEC. 
 We may also be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness, with the effect of recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 As a result, we may find it difficult or impossible to meet distribution requirements from our ordinary operations in certain circumstances. In particular, where we experience differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our taxable income could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt or (iv) make a taxable distribution of our shares, as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution), in order to comply with REIT requirements. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 We may choose to make distributions to our stockholders in our own stock, or make a distribution of a subsidiary s common stock, in which case our stockholders could be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive. 
 We may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. We may also determine to distribute a taxable dividend in the stock of a subsidiary in connection with a spin-off or other transaction. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of the distribution as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sale proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of that stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. 
 The stock ownership limit imposed by the Code for REITs and our charter may restrict our business combination opportunities. 
 In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year following our first year. Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take the actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8 of the aggregate value of our outstanding capital stock. Our board may grant an exemption in its sole discretion, subject to such conditions, representations and undertakings as it may determine. The ownership limits imposed by the tax law are based upon direct or indirect ownership by individuals, but only during the last half of a tax year. The ownership limits contained in our charter key off the ownership at any time by any person, which term includes entities. These ownership limitations in our charter are common in REIT charters and are intended to provide added assurance of compliance with the tax law requirements, and to minimize administrative burdens. However, these ownership limits might also delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.

 Even as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. 
 Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. In addition, in order to continue to meet the REIT qualification requirements, prevent the recognition of certain types of non-cash income, or to avert the imposition of a 100 tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory, we may hold a significant amount of our assets through our TRSs or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate-level income tax at regular rates. In addition, if we lend money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to us, which could result in an even higher corporate-level tax liability. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. 
 To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy ongoing tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts that we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. In addition, in certain cases, the modification of a debt instrument could result in the conversion of the instrument from a qualifying real estate asset to a wholly or partially non-qualifying asset that must be contributed to a TRS or disposed of in order for us to maintain our REIT status. Compliance with the source-of-income requirements may also limit our ability to acquire debt instruments at a discount from their face amount. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make, and in certain cases to maintain ownership of, certain attractive investments. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of MBS. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20 of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 The failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. 
 We have entered into financing arrangements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we would nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. Economically, these agreements are financings which are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. We believe that we would be treated for REIT asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreement may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 We may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them. 
 We may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The discount at which such debt instruments are acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates. The amount of such discount will nevertheless generally be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the rules applicable in reporting market discount as income, such market discount may have to be included in income as if the debt instruments were assured of being collected in full. If we ultimately collect less on the debt instruments than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions. In addition, we may acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. If the amendments to the outstanding debt are significant modifications under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a debt-for-debt exchange with the 
 50 

Table of Content s 

 borrower. In that event, we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt, even if the value of the debt or the payment expectations have not changed. 
 Moreover, some of the MBS that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. We will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such MBS will be made. If such MBS turns out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectability is provable. 
 Finally, in the event that any debt instruments or MBS acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate MBS at its stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are ultimately collectible. In each case, while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter. 
 If any of our subsidiary REITs failed to qualify as a REIT, we could be subject to higher taxes, fail to remain qualified as a REIT and/or be subject to other adverse consequences . 
 We own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in one or more entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as REITs under the Code (each, a Subsidiary REIT ). A Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes on its taxable income at regular corporate rates, (ii) the Subsidiary REIT s failure to so qualify could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus could impair our ability to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions and (iii) such failure could also cause certain entities owned by the Subsidiary REIT that are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries (or otherwise as disregarded) to be treated as taxable mortgage pools TMPs ), which could cause adverse tax and other adverse consequences. 
 The taxable mortgage pool rules will increase the taxes that we, or our stockholders may, incur and limit our actions with respect to our taxable mortgage pool. 
 Securitizations in the form of bonds or notes secured principally by mortgage loans generally result in the creation of TMPs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The debt securities issued by TMPs are sometimes referred to as collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs ), which include CLOs. We have issued CLOs through TMPs. Unless a TMP is wholly-owned by a REIT, it is subject to taxation as a corporation. However, so long as a REIT owns 100 of the equity interests in a TMP, the TMP will not be taxed as a corporation. Instead, certain categories of the REIT s stockholders, such as foreign stockholders eligible for treaty or sovereign benefits, stockholders with net operating losses, and generally tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, may be subject to taxation, or to increased taxes, on any portion, known as excess inclusions , of their dividend income from the REIT that is attributable to the TMP, but only to the extent that the REIT actually distributes excess inclusions to them. We intend not to distribute excess inclusions , but to pay the tax on excess inclusions ourselves. Notwithstanding our intention to try to avoid distributions to our stockholders of excess inclusions , it is possible that some portion of our dividends to our stockholders may be so characterized. 
 In order to control better, and to attempt to avoid, the distribution of excess inclusions to our stockholders, all of our TMPs are wholly-owned by a Subsidiary REIT that has elected to be treated as a REIT. Our Subsidiary REIT is required to satisfy, on a stand-alone basis, the REIT asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements described above, and if it were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then our Subsidiary REIT would face adverse tax consequences similar to those described above with respect to our qualification as a REIT and, as described above, failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests and thus could impair our ability to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. 
 Because our TMPs must at all times be owned by a REIT, we are restricted from selling equity interests in it, or selling any notes or bonds issued by it that might be considered to be equity for tax purposes, to other investors if doing so would subject it to taxation. These restrictions limit the liquidity of our investments in our TMPs and may prevent us from incurring greater leverage on that investment in order to maximize our returns from it. 
 The tax on prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans, which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 A REIT s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of or securitize loans in a 
 51 

Table of Content s 

 manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the REIT level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. 
 Our investments in construction loans require us to make estimates about the fair value of land improvements that may be challenged by the IRS. 
 We invest in construction loans, the interest from which is qualifying income for purposes of the REIT income tests, provided that the loan value of the real property securing the construction loan is equal to or greater than the highest outstanding principal amount of the construction loan during any taxable year. For purposes of construction loans, the loan value of the real property is the fair value of the land plus the reasonably estimated cost of the improvements or developments (other than personal property) that secure the loan and that are to be constructed from the proceeds of the loan. There can be no assurance that the IRS would not challenge our estimate of the loan value of the real property. 
 The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. 
 We invest in mezzanine loans, for which the IRS has provided a safe harbor but not rules of substantive law. Pursuant to the safe harbor, if a mezzanine loan meets certain requirements, it will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75 income test. We may acquire mezzanine loans that do not meet all of the requirements of this safe harbor. In the event we own a mezzanine loan that does not meet the safe harbor, the IRS could challenge such loan s treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests and, if such a challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 Liquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. 
 The REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into either (i) to manage risk of interest rate or price changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, (ii) to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to items of income that qualify for purposes of the REIT 75 or 95 gross income tests or assets that generate such income or (iii) to hedge another instrument that hedges risks described in clause (i) or (ii) for a period following the extinguishment of the liability or the disposition of the asset that was previously hedged by the instrument, and provided that, in each case, the applicable hedging instrument is properly identified under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a domestic TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRS will not directly reduce our REIT taxable income but may reduce current or future taxable income in the TRS. 
 Partnership tax audits could increase the tax liability borne by us in the event of a U.S. federal income tax audit of a subsidiary partnership. 
 In connection with U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships (such as certain of our subsidiaries) and the collection of any tax resulting from any such audits or other tax proceedings, the partnership itself may be liable for partner-level taxes (including interest and penalties) resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit, regardless of changes in the composition of the partners (or their relative ownership) between the year under audit and the year of the adjustment. The rules also include an elective alternative method under which the additional taxes resulting from the adjustment are assessed from the affected partners, subject to a higher rate of interest than otherwise would apply. Although regulations have been issued and address some aspects of these rules, questions remain as to how they will apply. These rules could increase the U.S. federal income tax, interest, and/or penalties economically borne by us in the event of a U.S. federal income tax audit of a subsidiary partnership in comparison to prior law. 
 Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders. 
 The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws 
 52 

Table of Content s 

 might affect us or our stockholders. New legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Changes in accounting rules and other policy or regulatory changes could occur at any time and could impact us in significantly negative ways that we are unable to predict or protect against. 
 The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and other regulatory bodies that establish the accounting rules applicable to us have proposed or enacted a wide array of changes to accounting rules over the last several years. Moreover, in the future, these regulators may propose additional changes that we do not currently anticipate. Changes to accounting rules that apply to us could significantly impact our business or our reported financial performance in negative ways that we cannot predict or protect against. We cannot predict whether any changes to current accounting rules will occur or what impact any codified changes will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. 
 Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we believe that internal controls were effective. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the required dates. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially and adversely affect us by, for example, leading to a decline in our stock price and impairing our ability to raise capital. 
 Our board of directors has approved very broad investment guidelines for our Manager and does not approve each investment and financing decision made by our Manager unless required by our investment guidelines. 
 Our Manager is authorized to follow very broad investment guidelines which enable our Manager to make investments on our behalf in a wide array of assets. Our board of directors will periodically review our investment guidelines and our investment portfolio but will not, and will not be required to, review all of our proposed investments, except that any investment that is equal to or in excess of 250.0 million but less than 400.0 million will require approval of the investment committee of our board of directors and any investment that is equal to or in excess of 400.0 million will require approval of our board of directors. See Item 1. Business Investment Guidelines in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these investment guidelines. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our board of directors may rely and may make investments through affiliates primarily on information provided to them by our Manager. Furthermore, our Manager may use complex strategies, and transactions entered into by our Manager may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our board of directors. Our Manager (or such affiliates) has great latitude within the broad parameters of our investment guidelines in determining the types and amounts of target assets it decides are attractive investments for us, which could result in investment returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business operations and results. Further, decisions made and investments and financing arrangements entered into by our Manager may not fully reflect the best interests of our stockholders. 
 New investments may not be profitable (or as profitable as we expect), may increase our exposure to certain industries, may increase our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency, real estate market or credit market fluctuations, may divert managerial attention from more profitable opportunities and may require significant financial resources. A change in our investment strategy may also increase any guarantee obligations we agree to incur or increase the number of transactions we enter into with affiliates. Moreover, new investments may present risks that are difficult for us to adequately assess, given our lack of familiarity with a particular type of investment. The risks related to new investments or the financing risks associated with such investments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

 Our board of directors has in the past and may in the future at any time change one or more of our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies without stockholder consent. 
 Our board of directors has in the past and may in the future at any time change one or more of our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to investments, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile. Any change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations. These changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these investment opportunities. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire our target assets at attractive prices. In acquiring our target assets, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, commercial and investment banks, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by Starwood Capital Group), commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Several other REITs have raised significant amounts of capital and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us, such as funding from the U.S. government, if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the U.S. government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we do. Furthermore, competition for investments in our target assets may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable investments in our target assets may be limited in the future and we may not be able to continue to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, as we may not be able to identify and make additional investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. 
 We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our network systems and storage applications, and those systems and storage and other business applications maintained by our third party providers, may be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access, breach, malfeasance or other system disruptions. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and the damage caused thereby. While we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems and validate the security of our third party providers, including through information security policies and employee awareness and training, such actions may not be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. The loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or unauthorized access to, information or our failure to meet our obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties and remediation costs. A significant data breach or our failure to meet our obligations may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In particular, our business is highly dependent on the communications and information systems of Starwood Capital Group. Any failure or interruption of Starwood Capital Group s systems could cause delays or other problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 We are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather, including as the result of global climate changes, which may result in damage to our properties. 
 Natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes or floods may result in significant damage to the properties securing our loans or in which we invest. In addition, our investments may be exposed to new or increased risks and liabilities associated with global climate change, such as increased frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters, which could negatively impact our and our borrowers businesses and the value of the properties securing our loans or in which we invest. The extent of our or our borrowers' casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be materially and adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather, including those associated with global climate change.

 In addition, global climate change concerns could result in additional legislation and regulatory requirements, including those associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could increase expenses or otherwise adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the business, results of operations and financial condition of our borrowers. 
 Our business may be adversely affected as the result of environmental, social and governance matters. 
 Our business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance ESG matters. In particular, shareholder, public and governmental expectations have been increasing with respect to ESG activities, including with respect to corporate responsibility, sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change. A number of organizations measure the performance of companies on various ESG topics, and the results of these assessments may be widely-publicized and may change frequently. Shareholders and prospective investors may use these assessments to, among other matters, determine whether to invest in our securities, engage with us to advocate for improved ESG performance or disclosure, make voting decisions, or take other actions to hold us and our board of directors accountable with respect to ESG matters. We also face reputational damage in the event we or our Manager does not meet the ESG-related standards or expectations of shareholders, prospective investors or other stakeholders, or if we are unable to achieve acceptable ESG assessments from third parties. 
 In addition, new laws or regulations may be enacted that require certain ESG-related disclosures or performance. Compliance with any such new laws or regulations would increase our regulatory burden, and compliance could be difficult and expensive. The failure to comply with any ESG-related laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the value of our stock and limit our ability to fund future growth, or result in investigations or litigation, or the threat thereof. 
 The market price and trading volume of our common stock could be volatile and the market price of our common stock could decline, resulting in a substantial or complete loss of your investment. 
 The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), which is the exchange on which our common stock is listed, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, overall weakness in the economy and other factors have contributed to extreme volatility of the equity markets generally, including the market price of our common stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include: 
 our actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, or changes in business strategy or prospects; 
 actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager or Starwood Capital Group and individuals, including our executives; 
 equity issuances by us or share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur; 
 actual or anticipated accounting problems; 
 publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; 
 changes in market valuations of similar companies; 
 adverse market reaction to the level of leverage we employ; 
 additions to or departures of our Manager s or Starwood Capital Group s key personnel; 
 speculation in the press or investment community; 
 our failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings estimates or those of any securities analysts; 
 increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for our common stock and would result in increased interest expenses on our debt; 
 failure to maintain our REIT qualification; 
 uncertainty regarding our exemption from the Investment Company Act; 
 price and volume fluctuations in the stock market generally; and 
 general market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital markets. 
 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their share price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our attention and resources.

 There may be future dilution of our common stock as a result of additional issuances of our securities, which could adversely impact our stock price. 
 Our board of directors is authorized under our charter to, among other things, authorize the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or the issuance of shares of preferred stock or additional securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval. Future issuances of our common stock or shares of preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. Because our decision to issue additional equity or convertible or exchangeable securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future issuances. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock. Also, we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.

Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Business Objectives 
 
 Our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets. 
 Since our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in the U.S., Europe and Australia. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities: 
 (1) Continue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than 75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators; 
 
 (2) Continue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing; 
 
 (3) Continue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing; 
 
 (4) Continue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment s sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; 
 
 (5) Expand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance; and 
 
 (6) Expand our originations and acquisitions of infrastructure debt investments. 
 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 Discussion of the potential impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is provided in the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Commercial and Residential Lending Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 388.7 million to 1.2 billion, compared to 779.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in interest income from loans of 352.8 million, and investment securities of 34.5 million. The increase in interest income from loans reflects (i) a 299.7 million increase from commercial loans, reflecting higher average balances and index rates, partially offset by the timing effect of certain loans being placed on nonaccrual, and (ii) a 53.1 million increase from residential loans principally due to higher average balances reflecting the timing of purchases and securitizations, partially offset by lower average coupon rates. The increase in interest income from investment securities was primarily due to higher commercial and RMBS average investment balances and the effect of higher index rates on certain commercial investments. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 361.9 million to 611.6 million, compared to 249.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to (i) a 294.8 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio, (ii) a 43.4 million increase in credit loss provision from a reversal of 3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to a provision of 39.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and (iii) a 10.7 million increase in primarily legal related general and administrative expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding and higher average index rates. The credit loss provision during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to rising index rates and its potential effect on borrower cash flows in our estimate of current expected credit losses CECL ). 
 
 Net Interest Income (amounts in thousands) 
 For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Interest income from loans 1,058,326 705,499 352,827 Interest income from investment securities 102,125 67,589 34,536 Interest expense (501,126) (206,353) (294,773) Net interest income 659,325 566,735 92,590 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 92.6 million to 659.3 million, compared to 566.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase reflects the increase in interest income, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities, both as discussed in the sections above. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s loans and investment securities, excluding retained RMBS and loans for which interest income is not recognized, were as follows: 
 For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Commercial 6.5 5.8 Residential 4.7 4.7 Overall 6.2 5.7 
 
 The weighted average unlevered yield on our commercial loans increased primarily due to higher index rates partially offset by the repayment of loans with higher LIBOR floors being replaced by newer loans with lower floating rate floors. The weighted average unlevered yield on our residential loans was unchanged, reflecting lower weighted average coupons which resulted from market spread tightening as well as a change in composition of our residential loan portfolio to include agency loans which generally carry a lower coupon than non-agency loans, the effect of which was offset by a decline in fair value of residential loans during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Content s 

 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 4.0 and 2.5 , respectively. The increase in borrowing rates primarily reflects higher index rates, partially offset by decreases in weighted average spreads particularly due to increased use of lower cost CLO financing. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 174.4 million to a loss of 115.8 million, compared to income of 58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease primarily reflects (i) a 366.2 million unfavorable change in fair value of residential loans, (ii) an 88.4 million loss contingency provision related to residential loans sold in February 2022 and later repurchased (refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) a 60.6 million increase in foreign currency loss, all partially offset by (iv) a 265.8 million increase in net gains on derivatives and (v) a 68.9 million increased gain on sale of foreclosed properties. The unfavorable change in fair value of residential loans was principally related to a rapid rise in interest rates and widening of credit spreads in 2022, which resulted in mark-to-market losses on our fixed coupon residential loans. The increased gains on derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflect a 190.2 million increased gain on interest rate swaps principally related to residential loans, which partially offsets the unfavorable change in fair value of those loans, and a 75.6 million increased gain on foreign currency hedges. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to hedge our interest rate risk on residential loans held-for-sale and to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and investments. The increased gain on foreign currency hedges and the increase in foreign currency loss reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling GBP ), Euro EUR and Australian dollar AUD during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a lesser overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against those currencies during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 66.8 million to 154.3 million, compared to 87.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of 65.2 million, principally due to higher average loan balances and index rates. 
 Costs and Expense s 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, costs and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 35.8 million to 100.6 million, compared to 64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 41.5 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund this segment s investment portfolio, partially offset by a 5.0 million decrease in credit loss provision. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding and higher average index rates. The decrease in the credit loss provision was primarily due to a lesser increase in the specific reserve for a credit-deteriorated loan.

 Revenues 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues of our Property Segment decreased 143.2 million to 91.8 million, compared to 235.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to the conversion of the Woodstar Portfolios to the Woodstar Fund on November 5, 2021. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, costs and expenses of our Property Segment decreased 133.9 million to 92.7 million, compared to 226.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the Woodstar Fund conversion referred to above. 
 Other Income 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, other income of our Property Segment increased 778.4 million to 789.7 million, compared to 11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other income is primarily due to (i) 749.3 million of higher income attributable to investments of the Woodstar Fund, including 699.2 million of unrealized increases in fair value, during the year ended December 31, 2022 and (ii) a 24.9 million increased gain on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. 
 Investing and Servicing Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased 4.9 million to 205.3 million, compared to 210.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to (i) an 8.3 million decrease in rental income principally reflecting fewer properties held and (ii) a 4.1 million decrease in servicing fees, partially offset by (iii) a 4.8 million increase in other fee income related to the origination of certain loans

 Costs and Expenses 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased 6.3 million to 137.8 million, compared to 144.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower costs and expenses of rental operations, reflecting fewer properties held. 
 Other Income 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased 62.8 million to 56.1 million, compared to 118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a 71.4 million unfavorable change in fair value of CMBS investments reflecting widening credit spreads and (ii) a 49.0 million lesser increase in fair value of conduit loans, partially offset by (iii) a 33.4 million increased gain on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on conduit loans and CMBS investments and (iv) a 28.7 million increased gain on sales of operating properties. 
 Corporate and Other Items 
 Corporate Costs and Expenses 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, corporate expenses increased 26.3 million to 330.8 million, compared to 304.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to (i) a 37.7 million increase in interest expense on higher average outstanding term loan and unsecured senior note balances, as well as higher index rates on our term loan, partially offset by (ii) a 12.6 million decrease in management fees, primarily reflecting lower incentive fees partially offset by higher base fees. 
 Corporate Other Loss 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, corporate other loss increased 72.0 million to 83.0 million, compared to 11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a greater loss on fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes. 
 Securitization VIE Eliminations 
 Securitization VIE eliminations primarily reclassify interest income and servicing fee revenues to other income (loss) for the CMBS and RMBS VIEs that we consolidate as primary beneficiary. Such eliminations have no overall effect on net income (loss) attributable to Starwood Property Trust. The reclassified revenues, along with applicable changes in fair value of investment securities and servicing rights, comprise the other income (loss) caption Change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs, which represents our beneficial interest in those consolidated VIEs. The magnitude of the securitization VIE eliminations is merely a function of the number of CMBS and RMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of operating results. The eliminations primarily relate to CMBS trusts for which the Investing and Servicing Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary and, to a much lesser extent, some CMBS and RMBS trusts for which the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 
 Our consolidated income taxes principally relate to the taxable nature of our loan servicing and loan securitization businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our income taxes decreased 70.2 million to a benefit of 61.5 million, compared to a provision of 8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to tax losses of our TRSs during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to taxable income of our TRSs during the year ended December 31, 2021. The tax losses during the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily attributable to net unrealized losses on our residential loans resulting from elevated market volatility. This market dislocation resulted in us choosing to hold more residential loans rather than securitize them, which resulted in higher net unrealized losses on those loans during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased 142.9 million to 187.6 million, compared to 44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to non-controlling interests in increased income, including unrealized gains in fair value, of the Woodstar Fund for the full year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 Commercial and Residential Lending Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 29.7 million to 779.3 million, compared to 749.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in interest income from loans of 40.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from investment securities of 10.9 million. The increase in interest income from loans reflects a 37.2 million increase from commercial loans, reflecting higher average balances partially offset by lower prepayment related income, loans placed on nonaccrual and lower average LIBOR rates (partly mitigated by the LIBOR floors on most of our commercial loans) and a 2.8 million increase from residential loans principally due to higher average balances reflecting the timing of purchases and securitizations. The decrease in interest income from investment securities was primarily due to lower commercial and residential average investment balances, reflecting net repayments and liquidations, and lower average LIBOR rates affecting certain commercial investments. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased 24.1 million to 249.7 million, compared to 273.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a 50.8 million decrease in credit loss provision, partially offset by a 30.1 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio. The credit loss provision decreased from a provision of 47.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to a 3.6 million reversal during the year ended December 31, 2021. The large provision in the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the significant deterioration in macroeconomic forecasts resulting from the initial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our then estimate of CECL. The credit loss reversal during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to an improvement in macroeconomic forecasts. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding, partially offset by lower average LIBOR rates.

 During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s loans and investment securities, excluding retained RMBS and loans for which interest income is not recognized, were as follows: 
 For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 2020 
 Commercial 5.8 6.7 Residential 4.7 5.7 Overall 5.7 6.6 
 The overall weighted average unlevered yield on our commercial loans decreased primarily due to repayment of loans with higher LIBOR floors being replaced by newer loans with lower floating rate floors and lower prepayment related income. The unlevered yield on our residential loans decreased due to lower weighted average coupons which resulted from market spread tightening as well as a change in the composition of our residential loan portfolio to include more agency loans which generally carry a lower coupon than non-agency loans. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 2.5 and 2.8 , respectively. The decrease in borrowing rates primarily reflects decreases in LIBOR. 
 Other Income 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased 5.5 million to 58.6 million, compared to 53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase primarily reflects (i) a 131.8 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, (ii) a 17.7 million gain on sale of a foreclosed property in the first quarter of 2021 and (iii) a 6.8 million lesser decrease in fair value of investment securities, partially offset by (iv) a 78.2 million unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss), (v) a 63.1 million lesser increase in fair value of residential loans and (vi) 4.6 million of transfer taxes related to the foreclosure of a residential conversion project. The favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a 73.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on foreign currency hedges and a 58.7 million favorable change in gain (loss) on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and investments. The unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) and favorable change in foreign currency hedges reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP, EUR and AUD during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a weakening of the U.S. dollar against those currencies during the year ended December 31, 2020. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings which fund fixed rate investments and to hedge our interest rate risk on residential loans held-for-sale. 
 Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 Revenues 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 6.5 million to 87.5 million, compared to 81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of 7.2 million principally due to higher average balances outstanding, partially offset by lower average LIBOR rates. 
 Costs and Expense s 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, costs and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment increased 10.8 million to 64.8 million, compared to 54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to (i) a 16.0 million increase in credit loss provision, partially offset by (ii) a 3.2 million decrease in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio and (iii) a 1.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. The credit loss provision increased to 11.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a 4.1 million reversal during the year ended December 31, 2020. The 11.9 million provision in 2021 includes a 10.1 million specific reserve for a loan which became credit deteriorated during the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average LIBOR rates.

 Other Income 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased 84.7 million to 118.9 million, compared to 34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a 79.6 million favorable change in fair value of CMBS investments, (ii) a 29.6 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on conduit loans and CMBS investments and (iii) a 14.2 million increase in gain on sale of properties, partially offset by (iv) a 30.0 million decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities and (v) a 7.1 million lesser increase in fair value of servicing rights. The fair value of our CMBS investments was adversely affected during the year ended December 31, 2020 by widening credit spreads resulting from market disruption and dislocation caused by the initial impacts of COVID-19. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities reflects the nonrecurrence of realized and unrealized gains totaling 27.9 million resulting from the sale in April 2020 of a portion of our unconsolidated equity interest in a servicing and advisory business.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Distributable Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following: 
 (i) non-cash equity compensation expense; 
 (ii) incentive fees due under our management agreement; 
 (iii) depreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles; 
 (iv) acquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions; 
 (v) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period; and 
 (vi) any deductions for distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein. 
 The CECL reserve has been excluded from Distributable Earnings consistent with other unrealized gains (losses) pursuant to our existing policy for reporting Distributable Earnings. We expect to only recognize such potential credit losses in Distributable Earnings if and when such amounts are deemed nonrecoverable upon a realization event. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold, but non-recoverability may also be determined if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The realized loss amount reflected in Distributable Earnings will equal the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the book value of the asset, and is reflective of our economic experience as it relates to the ultimate realization of the loan. 
 
 We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe Distributable Earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of our common stock as historically, over time, Distributable Earnings has been a strong indicator of our dividends per share. As a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and therefore we believe our dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in our common stock. Further, Distributable Earnings helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations, and is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends. We also use Distributable Earnings (previously defined as Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. 
 Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, taxable income, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies. 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, consolidation of securitization variable interest entities VIEs results in the elimination of certain key financial statement line items, particularly within revenues and other income, including unrealized changes in fair value of loans and investment securities. These line items are essential to understanding the true financial performance of our business segments and the Company as a whole. For this reason, as referenced in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we present business segment data in Note 24 without consolidation of these VIEs. This is how we manage our business and is the basis for all data reviewed with our board of directors, investors and analysts. This presentation also allows for a more transparent reconciliation of the unrealized gain (loss) adjustments below to the segment data presented in Note 24. 
 The weighted average diluted share count applied to Distributable Earnings for purposes of determining Distributable Earnings per share EPS is computed using the GAAP diluted share count, adjusted for the following: 
 (i) Unvested stock awards Currently, unvested stock awards are excluded from the denominator of GAAP EPS. The related compensation expense is also excluded from Distributable Earnings. In order to effectuate dilution from these awards in the Distributable Earnings computation, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to include these shares.

 (ii) Convertible Notes Conversion of our Convertible Notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Distributable Earnings, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to exclude the potential shares issuable upon conversion until a conversion occurs. 
 (iii) Subsidiary equity The intent of a February 2018 amendment to our management agreement (the Amendment is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. The Class A Units issued in connection with the acquisition of assets in our Woodstar II Portfolio are currently excluded from our GAAP diluted share count, with the subsidiary equity represented as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our GAAP balance sheet. Consistent with the Amendment, we adjust GAAP diluted share count to include these subsidiary units. 
 
 The following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Distributable EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):

 The definition of Distributable Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Distributable Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. 
 We encountered this type of situation during 2021 when we sold a 20.6 interest in the Woodstar Fund to third parties. As a result of the conversion of the Woodstar Fund into an investment company and our consolidation of the Woodstar Fund as discussed in Notes 2 and 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a 1.2 billion cumulative effect adjustment in stockholders equity, computed as the difference between the fair value and previous carrying value of the Woodstar Fund s investments. Although this amount was recognized from a GAAP perspective, the adjustment was recorded directly to stockholders equity and was not reflected in GAAP earnings. 
 In an effort to reflect the cash received for the 20.6 portion of the Woodstar Fund that was sold to third parties, we modified the definition of Distributable Earnings to allow for the treatment of sales as realized if GAAP would otherwise view them as realized even when not recorded in GAAP earnings. This modification was further refined to not include the entirety of the cumulative effect adjustment in Distributable Earnings, but rather to only include the portion for which cash was received. We believe this is consistent with the definition of Distributable Earnings where changes in fair value are not recognized until realized and is likewise consistent with the determination of taxable income.

 (1) The reconciling items in this section are equivalent to the amounts recognized within GAAP net income (before the consolidation of VIEs), each of which can be agreed back to the respective lines within Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. They reflect both unrealized and realized (gains) and losses. For added transparency and consistency of presentation, the entire amount recognized in GAAP income is reversed in this section, and the realized components of these amounts are reflected in the next section entitled Recognition of Distributable realized gains / (losses).

 (2) Represents the realized portion of GAAP gains (losses) on residential and commercial conduit loans carried under the fair value option that were sold during the period. The amount is calculated as the difference between (i) the net proceeds received in connection with a securitization or sale of loans and (ii) such loans historical cost basis. 
 (3) Represents loan losses that are deemed nonrecoverable, which is generally upon a realization event, such as when a loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold. Non-recoverability may also be determined if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that amounts due will not be collected. The amount is calculated as the difference between the cash received and the book value of the asset. 
 (4) Represents the realized portion of GAAP gains (losses) on CMBS and RMBS carried under the fair value option that are sold or impaired during the period. Upon sale, the difference between the cash proceeds received and the historical cost basis of the security is treated as a realized gain or loss for Distributable Earnings purposes. We consider a CMBS or an RMBS credit loss to be realized when such amounts are deemed nonrecoverable. Non-recoverability is generally at the time the underlying assets within the securitization are liquidated, but non-recoverability may also be determined if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The amount is calculated as the difference between the cash received and the historical cost basis of the security. 
 (5) Represents GAAP income from the Woodstar Fund investments excluding unrealized changes in the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities. The amount is calculated as the difference between the Woodstar Fund s GAAP net income and its unrealized gains (losses), which represents changes in working capital and actual cash distributions received. 
 (6) Represents the difference between the proceeds we received in connection with the Woodstar Fund transaction and our amortized cost basis. Because GAAP accounted for the transaction as an adjustment to equity, no GAAP earnings impact resulted. However, the transaction was a taxable event under the tax rules and was thus included in our computation of Distributable Earnings. Refer to the preceding Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussion above for more information. 
 (7) Represents the realized portion of GAAP gains or losses on the termination or settlement of derivatives that are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives are only treated as realized for Distributable Earnings when they are terminated or settled, and cash is exchanged. The amount of cash received or paid to terminate or settle the derivative is the amount treated as realized for Distributable Earnings purposes at the time of such termination or settlement. 
 (8) Represents the realized portion of foreign currency gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Realization occurs when the foreign currency is converted back to USD. The amount is calculated as the difference between the foreign exchange rate at the time the asset was placed on the balance sheet and the foreign exchange rate at the time cash is received and is offset by any gains or losses on the related foreign currency derivative at settlement. 
 (9) Represents GAAP earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excluding non-cash items and unrealized changes in fair value recorded on the books and records of the unconsolidated entities. The difference between GAAP and Distributable Earnings for these entities principally relates to depreciation and unrealized changes in the fair value of mortgage loans and securities. 
 (10) Represents the realized gain (loss) on sales of properties held at depreciated cost. Because depreciation is a non-cash expense that is excluded from Distributable Earnings, GAAP gains upon sale of a property are higher, and GAAP losses are lower, than the respective realized amounts reflected in Distributable Earnings. The amount is calculated as net sales proceeds less undepreciated cost, adjusted for any non-controlling interest.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Commercial and Residential Lending Segment 
 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s Distributable Earnings increased by 167.2 million, from 542.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 709.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. After making adjustments for the calculation of Distributable Earnings, revenues were 1.2 billion, costs and expenses were 559.8 million, other income was 85.5 million and income tax benefit was 4.6 million. 
 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by 401.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in interest income from loans of 352.8 million and investment securities of 46.8 million. The increase in interest income from loans reflects (i) a 299.7 million increase from commercial loans, reflecting higher average balances and index rates, partially offset by the timing effect of certain loans being placed on nonaccrual, and (ii) a 53.1 million increase from residential loans principally due to higher average balances reflecting the timing of purchases and securitizations, partially offset by lower average coupon rates. The increase in interest income from investment securities was primarily due to higher commercial and RMBS average investment balances and the effect of higher index rates on certain commercial investments. 
 Costs and expenses increased by 299.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) a 294.8 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio and (ii) a 9.9 million increase in primarily legal related general and administrative expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding and higher average index rates. 
 Other income increased by 53.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) a 76.4 million increased gain on sale of foreclosed properties and (ii) a 42.6 million decrease in recognized losses on RMBS investments, partially offset by (iii) a 42.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on residential loan sales and securitizations, net of related interest rate derivatives, and (iv) a 25.8 million unfavorable change in Distributable Earnings (Loss) from an unconsolidated residential mortgage originator. 
 Income taxes, which principally relate to the taxable nature of this segment s residential loan securitization activities which are housed in TRSs, decreased 12.3 million to a benefit of 4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a provision of 7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in securitization activity during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting from elevated market volatility during the period. This market dislocation resulted in us choosing to hold more residential loans rather than securitize them. 
 Infrastructure Lending Segment 
 The Infrastructure Lending Segment s Distributable Earnings increased by 27.0 million, from 37.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 64.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. After making adjustments for the calculation of Distributable Earnings, revenues were 154.4 million, costs and expenses were 92.1 million and other income was 2.2 million. 
 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by 66.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of 65.2 million, principally due to higher average loan balances and index rates. 
 Costs and expenses increased by 41.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a 41.5 million increase in interest expense reflecting higher average borrowings outstanding and higher average index rates. 
 Other income (loss) improved by 2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a 1.5 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated entity and a 0.8 million lower loss on extinguishment of debt.

 Revenues decreased by 140.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the conversion of the Woodstar Portfolios to the Woodstar Fund on November 5, 2021. 
 Costs and expenses decreased by 100.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the Woodstar Fund conversion referred to above. 
 Other income decreased by 133.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) the nonrecurrence of 196.4 million in Distributable Earnings relating to the 20.6 sale of third party investor interests in the Woodstar Fund (excluding 5.1 million of related professional fees included in costs and expenses for both GAAP and Distributable Earnings) during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by (ii) a 49.4 million increase in Distributable Earnings from the Woodstar Fund investments (before a 9.2 million increase in related non-controlling interests) during the year ended December 31, 2022 and (iii) a 9.7 million favorable change in realized gains (losses) on derivatives which primarily hedge our interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. 
 Investing and Servicing Segment 
 The Investing and Servicing Segment s Distributable Earnings decreased by 22.5 million from 150.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 128.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Revenues decreased by 10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) an 8.8 million decrease in rental income principally reflecting fewer properties held and (ii) a 4.1 million decrease in servicing fees, partially offset by (iii) a 4.8 million increase in other fee income related to the origination of certain loans contributed into CMBS transactions. 
 Costs and expenses decreased by 4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Other income includes profit realized upon securitization of loans by our conduit business, gains on sales of CMBS and operating properties, gains and losses on derivatives that were either effectively terminated or novated, and earnings from unconsolidated entities. These items are typically offset by a decrease in the fair value of our domestic servicing rights intangible which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset, net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts. Derivatives include instruments which hedge interest rate risk and credit risk on our conduit loans. For GAAP purposes, the loans, CMBS and derivatives are accounted for at fair value, with all changes in fair value (realized or unrealized) recognized in earnings. The adjustments to Distributable Earnings outlined above are also applied to the GAAP earnings of our unconsolidated entities. Other income decreased by 16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) a 52.3 million decrease in realized gains on conduit loans and (ii) a 14.9 million decrease in realized gains

 and increase in recognized losses on CMBS, partially offset by (iii) a 29.7 million increase in realized gains on derivatives principally related to conduit loans and (iv) a 23.3 million increased gain on sales of operating properties.. 
 Income taxes, which principally relate to the taxable nature of this segment s loan servicing and loan securitization businesses which are housed in TRSs, decreased 3.1 million due to lower taxable income of those TRSs during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Income attributable to non-controlling interests increased 2.9 million. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate loss increased by 57.0 million, from 199.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 256.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) a 38.1 million increase in interest expense on higher average outstanding term loan and unsecured senior note balances, as well as higher index rates on our term loan, (ii) a 9.6 million decrease in realized gains on fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes and (iii) an 8.8 million increase in base management fees. 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 Commercial and Residential Lending Segment 
 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment s Distributable Earnings decreased by 9.3 million, from 551.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 542.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. After making adjustments for the calculation of Distributable Earnings, revenues were 777.9 million, costs and expenses were 260.4 million, other income was 32.5 million and income tax provision was 7.7 million. 
 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by 29.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in interest income from loans of 40.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from investment securities of 11.5 million. The increase in interest income from loans reflects a 37.2 million increase from commercial loans reflecting higher average balances partially offset by lower prepayment related income, loans placed on nonaccrual and lower average LIBOR rates (partly mitigated by the LIBOR floors on most of our commercial loans) and a 2.8 million increase from residential loans principally due to higher average balances reflecting the timing of purchases and securitizations. The decrease in interest income from investment securities was primarily due to lower commercial and residential average investment balances, reflecting net repayments and liquidations, and lower average LIBOR rates affecting certain commercial investments. 
 Costs and expenses increased by 38.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) a 30.1 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of this segment s investment portfolio and (ii) a 13.8 million increase in commercial loan write-offs, partially offset by (iii) a 2.7 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding, partially offset by lower average LIBOR rates. 
 Other income decreased by 6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) a 26.6 million increase in recognized losses on RMBS investments primarily due to higher than projected prepayment rates on the underlying residential loans, (ii) a 12.0 million decrease in gains on sales of RMBS and (iii) 4.6 million of transfer taxes relating to the foreclosure of a residential conversion project, all partially offset by (iv) a 28.5 million favorable change in realized gains (losses) on derivatives and foreign currency transactions and (v) an 8.3 million gain on sale of a foreclosed property. 
 Income taxes, which principally relate to the taxable nature of this segment s residential loan securitization activities which are housed in TRSs, decreased 6.9 million primarily due to lower taxable income of those TRSs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2020, we recorded a GAAP net tax provision related to unrealized fair value increases in our residential loans. Because the net fair value increases were unrealized in 2020, they along with their corresponding income tax provision were previously adjusted in our reconciliation to Distributable Earnings. Upon recognition of the realized gains in the first quarter of 2021 for Distributable Earnings purposes, the corresponding income tax provision was likewise recognized.

 Revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by 6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of 7.2 million principally due to higher average balances outstanding, partially offset by lower average LIBOR rates. 
 Costs and expenses decreased by 6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) a 3.2 million decrease in interest expense on the secured debt facilities used to finance this segment s investment portfolio principally due to lower average LIBOR rates and (ii) a 2.2 million decrease in general and administrative expenses reflecting lower compensation costs and professional fees. 
 Other loss decreased by 1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in earnings from an unconsolidated entity.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make new investments where appropriate, pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity and access to additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are as follows: 
 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 (amounts in thousands) 
 GAAP VIE Adjustments Excluding Securitization VIEs Net cash provided by operating activities 
 213,741 (1,482) 212,259 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Origination, purchase and funding of loans held-for-investment (5,544,012) (5,544,012) Proceeds from principal collections and sale of loans 2,198,460 2,198,460 Purchase and funding of investment securities (86,512) (289,833) (376,345) Proceeds from sales and collections of investment securities 115,947 93,412 209,359 Proceeds from sales of real estate 203,702 203,702 Purchases and additions to properties and other assets (25,225) (25,225) Net cash flows from other investments and assets 187,334 1,876 189,210 Net cash used in investing activities

 The discussion below is on a non-GAAP basis, after removing adjustments principally resulting from the consolidation of the securitization VIEs under ASC 810. These adjustments principally relate to (i) the purchase of CMBS, RMBS, loans and real estate from consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as repayments of VIE debt on a GAAP basis and (ii) sales, principal collections and redemptions of CMBS and RMBS related to consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as VIE distributions on a GAAP basis. There is no significant net impact to overall cash resulting from these consolidations. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 61.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, reflecting net cash provided by financing activities of 3.0 billion and operating activities of 212.3 million, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities of 3.1 billion. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 212.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related primarily to cash interest income of 948.5 million from our loans and 190.6 million from our investment securities and a net change in

 operating assets and liabilities of 170.0 million. Net rental income provided cash of 81.6 million and servicing fees provided cash of 54.6 million. Offsetting these cash inflows was cash interest expense of 672.1 million, 284.4 million in originations and purchases of loans held-for-sale, net of sales and principal collections, and general and administrative expenses of 253.7 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 related primarily to the origination and acquisition of loans held-for-investment of 5.5 billion and the purchase and funding of investment securities of 376.3 million, partially offset by proceeds received from principal collections and sales of loans of 2.2 billion and investment securities of 209.4 million and sales of operating properties for 203.7 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 related primarily to borrowings on our debt, net of repayments and deferred loan costs, of 3.6 billion, partially offset by dividend distributions of 591.5 million. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 
 We utilize a variety of financing arrangements, including: 
 1) Repurchase Agreements: Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own. Under these agreements, we sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, we had various repurchase agreements, with details referenced in the table provided below. 
 
 2) Secured Property Financings: We use long-term mortgage facilities from commercial lenders and government sponsors of affordable housing loans to finance many of the investment properties that we hold. These facilities accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We typically hedge our exposure to floating interest rate changes on these facilities through the use of interest rate swap and cap derivatives. 
 
 3) Bank Credit Facilities: We use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our assets. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. The lender retains the sole discretion, subject to certain conditions, over the market value of such note for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the lender. 
 
 4) Loan Sales, Syndications, Securitizations and/or CLO Transactions: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from loan sales, syndications, securitizations and/or CLOs of our investments in mortgage loans. These financings generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender. Securitizations and CLOs generally involve transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Sales, syndications, securitizations or CLOs of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question. 
 
 5) Unsecured Senior Notes and Term Loans: We issue senior notes, some of which are convertible, as well as term loans to finance certain operating and investing activities of the Company. The senior notes accrue interest at fixed interest rates, while the term loans are variable, and vary in tenure. Refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

 In the normal course of business, the Company is in discussions with its lenders to extend, amend or replace any financing facilities which contain near term expirations. 
 
 Issuances of Equity Securities 
 We may raise funds through capital market transactions by issuing capital stock. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have authorized 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2022, we had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and 189,324,830 shares of common stock available for issuance. 
 
 Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our issuances of equity securities in recent years. 
 Other Potential Sources of Financing 
 In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets and maturities of our unsecured senior notes, including other secured as well as unsecured forms of borrowing and sale of senior loan interests and other assets. 
 Leverage Policies 
 
 We employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our stockholders, or provide temporary liquidity. Leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing or indirect through originating, acquiring or retaining subordinated mortgages, B-Notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed, we intend, when possible, to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the Company of credit losses associated with any individual asset. In 
 88 

Table of Content s 

 addition, we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements. 
 The amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S., European and Australian economies and commercial, residential and infrastructure markets, our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the applicable reference rate curve. Our secured debt agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that in some cases restrict our total leverage (as defined therein). As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
 Cash Requirements 
 
 Dividends 
 U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income. We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our taxable income (which does not necessarily equal our GAAP net income) to our stockholders each year, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed dividend history. 
 
 The tax treatment for our aggregate distributions per share of common stock paid with respect to the 2022 tax year is as follows: 
 Record Date Payable Date Per Share Dividend Ordinary Taxable Dividends Taxable Qualified Dividends Total Capital Gain Distribution Unrecaptured 1250 Gain Section 199A Dividends 12/31/2021 1/14/2022 0.0755 0.0556 0.0009 0.0199 0.0007 0.0547 3/31/2022 4/15/2022 0.4800 0.3534 0.0054 0.1266 0.0041 0.3480 6/30/2022 7/15/2022 0.4800 0.3534 0.0054 0.1266 0.0041 0.3480 9/30/2022 10/14/2022 0.4800 0.3534 0.0054 0.1266 0.0041 0.3480 12/30/2022 1/13/2023 0.4800 0.3534 0.0054 0.1266 0.0041 0.3480 1.9955 1.4692 0.0225 0.5263 0.0171 1.4467 
 
 Of the 0.48 per share 2021 fourth quarter distribution paid in January 2022, 0.4045 was previously treated as a 2021 distribution and 0.0755 is being treated as a 2022 distribution for federal tax purposes.

 The table above does not include interest payable, amounts due under our management agreement, amounts due under our derivative agreements or amounts due under guarantees as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments. 
 Our secured financings, CLOs and SASB consist primarily of matched-term funding for our loans and investment securities and long-term mortgages on our owned properties. Repayments of such facilities are generally made from proceeds from maturities, prepayments or sales of such investments and operating cash flows from owned properties. In the normal course of business, we are in discussions with our lenders to extend, amend or replace any financing facilities which contain near term expirations. 
 Our unsecured senior notes are expected to be repaid from a combination of available cash on hand, approved but undrawn capacity under our secured financing agreements, and/or equity issuances or other potential sources of financing, as discussed above, including issuances of new unsecured senior notes. 
 Our future loan commitments are expected to be primarily matched-term funded under secured financing agreements with any difference funded from available cash on hand or other potential sources of financing discussed above. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. The following discussion describes the critical accounting estimates that apply to our operations and require complex management judgment. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Credit Losses 
 Loans and Debt Securities Measured at Amortized Cost 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, ASC 326 , Financial Instruments Credit Losses , became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. ASC 326 mandates the use of a current expected credit loss model CECL for estimating future credit losses of certain financial instruments measured at amortized cost, instead of the incurred loss credit model previously required under GAAP. The CECL model requires the consideration of possible credit losses over the life of an instrument as opposed to only estimating credit losses upon the occurrence of a discrete loss event under the previous incurred loss methodology. The CECL model applies to our loans held-for-investment HFI and our held-to-maturity HTM debt securities which are carried at amortized cost, including future funding commitments and accrued interest receivable related to those loans and securities. 
 As we do not have a history of realized credit losses on our HFI loans and HTM securities, we have subscribed to third party database services to provide us with historical industry losses for both commercial real estate and infrastructure loans. Using these losses as a benchmark, we determine expected credit losses for our loans and securities on a collective basis within our commercial real estate and infrastructure portfolios. Such determination also incorporates significant assumptions and estimates regarding, among other things, prepayments, future fundings and economic forecasts. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our methodologies. 
 We also evaluate each loan and security measured at amortized cost for credit deterioration at least quarterly. Credit deterioration occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual 
 90 

Table of Content s 

 terms of the loan or security. If a loan or security is considered to be credit deteriorated, we depart from the industry loss rate approach described above and determine the credit loss allowance as any excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan or security over (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the contractual effective interest rate or (ii) the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. 
 Significant judgment is required when estimating future credit losses; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. As of December 31, 2022, we held 19.2 billion of loans and HTM securities measured at amortized cost with expected future funding commitments of 2.3 billion. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized credit loss provisions of 46.7 million, 8.3 million and 43.2 million, respectively, and the related credit loss allowance was 112.5 million and 82.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 Separate provisions of ASC 326 apply to our available-for-sale AFS debt securities which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ). We are required to establish an initial credit loss allowance for those securities that are purchased with credit deterioration by grossing up the amortized cost basis of each security and providing an offsetting credit loss allowance for the difference between expected cash flows and contractual cash flows, both on a present value basis. 
 Subsequently, cumulative adverse changes in expected cash flows on our available-for-sale debt securities are recognized currently as an increase to the credit loss allowance. However, the allowance is limited to the amount by which the AFS debt security s amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Favorable changes in expected cash flows are first recognized as a decrease to the allowance for credit losses (recognized currently in earnings). Such changes would be recognized as a prospective yield adjustment only when the allowance for credit losses is reduced to zero. A change in expected cash flows that is attributable solely to a change in a variable interest reference rate does not result in a credit loss and is accounted for as a prospective yield adjustment. 
 Significant judgment is required when estimating expected cash flows used in determining the credit loss allowance for AFS debt securities; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. As of December 31, 2022, we held 113.4 million of AFS debt securities. We did not recognize any provision for credit losses with respect to our AFS debt securities during the three years ended December 31, 2022 and there was no related credit loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. 
 Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value 
 We measure our VIE assets and liabilities, mortgage-backed securities, investments of consolidated affordable housing fund, derivative assets and liabilities, domestic servicing rights intangible asset and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value option at fair value. When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the various methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had 57.3 billion and 50.8 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, that are measured at fair value, including 52.5 billion of VIE assets and 50.8 billion of VIE liabilities we consolidate pursuant to ASC 810. 
 We measure the assets and liabilities of consolidated securitization VIEs at fair value pursuant to our election of the fair value option. The securitization VIEs in which we invest are static that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the VIE, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. As a result, the methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of our VIEs affect our earnings only to the extent of their impact on our direct investment in the VIEs. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 Our goodwill at December 31, 2022 of 259.8 million represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of LNR in April 2013 and the Infrastructure Lending Segment in September 2018 and October 2018. In testing goodwill for impairment, we follow ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which permits a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is determined to exist for the reporting unit. However, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the 
 91 

Table of Content s 

 reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, or we choose not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we compare the fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill, in a quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired with the impairment loss measured as the excess of the reporting unit s carrying value (inclusive of goodwill) over its fair value. 
 Based on our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2022, we believe that the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which the LNR acquisition goodwill was attributed is not currently at risk of failing a quantitative assessment. This qualitative assessment required judgment to be applied in evaluating the effects of multiple factors, including actual and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and relevant entity specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. 
 Based on our quantitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that the fair value of the Infrastructure Lending Segment reporting unit to which goodwill is attributed exceeded its carrying value including goodwill. This quantitative assessment required judgment to be applied in determining the fair value of our equity in the Infrastructure Lending Segment, which included estimates of future cash flows, terminal equity multiple and market discount rate. 
 Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets 
 The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of our deferred taxes.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our loans and investments are subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the owners ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, our asset management team reviews our investment portfolios and is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. 
 We seek to further manage credit risk associated with our Investing and Servicing Segment loans held-for-sale through the purchase of credit index instruments. The following table presents our credit index instruments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

Table of Content s 

Capital Market Risk 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under repurchase obligations or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and the related financing obligations. In general, we seek to match the interest rate characteristics of our investments with the interest rate characteristics of any related financing obligations such as repurchase agreements, bank credit facilities, term loans, revolving facilities and securitizations. In instances where the interest rate characteristics of an investment and the related financing obligation are not matched, we mitigate such interest rate risk through the utilization of interest rate derivatives of the same duration. The following table presents financial instruments where we have utilized interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate risk and the related interest rate derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):

 LIBOR Transition Risk 
 93 

Table of Content s 

The United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) stopped compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR and the LIBOR administrator ceased publication of non-U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021. However, for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the relevant date has been deferred to June 30, 2023. Regulators emphasized that, despite any continued publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR through June 30, 2023, no new contracts using U.S. dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. As indicated in the Interest Rate Risk section above, a substantial portion of our loans, investment securities, borrowings and interest rate derivatives are indexed to LIBOR or similar reference rates. Our U.S. dollar LIBOR-based loan agreements and borrowing arrangements generally specify alternative reference rates such as the prime rate, federal funds rate or secured overnight financing rate SOFR ). Our foreign denominated loan agreements and borrowing arrangements now generally specify the sterling overnight index average SONIA instead of GBP LIBOR and the bank bill swap rate BBSW or BBSY instead of AUD LIBOR. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, daily compounded SONIA is utilized as the floating benchmark rate on 2.3 billion of our loans and 1.7 billion of our debt outstanding, while SOFR is utilized as the floating benchmark rate on 6.3 billion of our loans and 8.3 billion of our debt outstanding. 
 
 At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR, SONIA, or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from USD LIBOR and GBP LIBOR proceeds. The resulting changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs and/or result in mismatches between the interest rates of our investments and the corresponding financings. 
 
 Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid earlier than anticipated, causing the return on certain investments to be less than expected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets. 
 Extension Risk 
 We compute the projected weighted-average life of our assets based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the loans or extend. If prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment or extension options are exercised, the life of the fixed-rate assets could extend beyond the term of the secured debt agreements. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. 
 Fair Value Risk 
 The estimated fair value of our investments fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate investments would be expected to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate investments would be expected to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets recorded and/or disclosed may be adversely impacted. Our economic exposure is generally limited to our net investment position as we seek to fund fixed rate investments with fixed rate financing or variable rate financing hedged with interest rate swaps. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our loans and investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are also subject to risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates. We generally mitigate this exposure by matching the currency of our foreign currency assets to the currency of the borrowings that finance those assets. As a result, we substantially reduce our exposure to changes in portfolio value related to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 We intend to hedge our net currency exposures in a prudent manner. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amount of payments received on the related investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailable hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 94 

Table of Content s 

 Consistent with our strategy of hedging foreign currency exposure on certain investments, we typically enter into a series of forwards to fix the U.S. dollar amount of foreign currency denominated cash flows (interest income and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated investments. Accordingly, the notional values and expiration dates of our foreign currency hedges approximate the amounts and timing of future payments we expect to receive on the related investments.

 Real Estate Risk 
 
 The market values of commercial and residential mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. 
 
 Inflation Risk 
 
 Most of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. Changes in interest rates may correlate with inflation rates 
 95

 and/or changes in inflation rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our distributions are determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair value without considering inflation.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with principles generally accepted in the United States of America . 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Investment Securities - Valuation of Level III Residential Mortgage Backed Securities and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Refer to Notes 6 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company has commercial mortgage-backed securities recorded in accordance with the fair value option and residential mortgage backed securities, available-for-sale recorded at fair value that are not actively traded and whose fair values are derived from proprietary pricing models that utilize unobservable inputs, market bids, other third party prices or quotes. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, these financial instruments are generally classified as Level 3 assets. Management s judgments in selecting the price estimate that is most reflective of fair value is inherently subjective. 
 98 

Table of Content s 

 Performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these fair values requires a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling expertise. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to management s fair value estimates for Level 3 assets, included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those controls relating to investment security metrics and characteristics, pricing sources, pricing policy and pricing selection. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent fair value estimates for selected investment securities and compared our estimates to management s estimates. 
 We evaluated the differences between our estimates of fair value and management s estimates and considered whether there were any indicators of management bias.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starwood Property Trust. Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules . 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 reportable business segments as of December 31, 2022 and we refer to the investments within these segments as our target assets: 
 Real estate commercial and residential lending (the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial first mortgages, non-agency residential mortgages residential loans ), subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ), residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and other real estate and real estate-related debt investments in the U.S., Europe and Australia (including distressed or non-performing loans). Our residential loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property and primarily consist of non-agency residential loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S. Government agency or federally chartered corporation. 
 Infrastructure lending (the Infrastructure Lending Segment engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing infrastructure debt investments. 
 Real estate property (the Property Segment engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized commercial real estate properties, including multifamily properties and commercial properties subject to net leases, that are held for investment. 
 Real estate investing and servicing (the Investing and Servicing Segment includes (i) a servicing business in the U.S. that manages and works out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization transactions and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts. 
 Our segments exclude the consolidation of securitization variable interest entities VIEs ). 
 We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements. 
 We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our Manager pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is controlled by Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

 of our consolidated securitization VIE assets, with the remaining representing loans. However, it is important to note that the fair value of our securitization VIE assets is determined by reference to our securitization VIE liabilities as permitted under Accounting Standard Update ASU 2014-13, Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity . In other words, our VIE liabilities are more reliably measurable than the VIE assets, resulting in our current measurement methodology which utilizes this value to determine the fair value of our securitization VIE assets as a whole. As a result, these percentages are not necessarily indicative of the relative fair values of each of these asset categories if the assets were to be valued individually. 
 Due to our accounting policy election under ASU 2014-13, separately presenting two different asset categories would result in an arbitrary assignment of value to each, with one asset category representing a residual amount, as opposed to its fair value. However, as a pool, the fair value of the assets in total is equal to the fair value of the liabilities. 
 For these reasons, the assets of our securitization VIEs are presented in the aggregate.

 reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the securitization VIEs, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. Refer to Note 21 for further discussion regarding our fair value measurements.

 million increase to our total allowance for credit losses, which was recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2020. 
 As we do not have a history of realized credit losses on our HFI loans and HTM securities, we have subscribed to third party database services to provide us with historical industry losses for both commercial real estate and infrastructure loans. Using these losses as a benchmark, we determine expected credit losses for our loans and securities on a collective basis within our commercial real estate and infrastructure portfolios. See Note 5 for further discussion of our methodologies. 
 We also evaluate each loan and security measured at amortized cost for credit deterioration at least quarterly. Credit deterioration occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan or security. If a loan or security is considered to be credit deteriorated, we depart from the industry loss rate approach described above and determine the credit loss allowance as any excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan or security over (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the contractual effective interest rate or (ii) the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. 
 Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 Separate provisions of ASC 326 apply to our AFS debt securities, which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of AOCI. We are required to establish an initial credit loss allowance for those securities that are purchased with credit deterioration PCD by grossing up the amortized cost basis of each security and providing an offsetting credit loss allowance for the difference between expected cash flows and contractual cash flows, both on a present value basis. As of the January 1, 2020 effective date, no such credit loss allowance gross-up was required on our AFS debt securities with PCD due to their individual unrealized gain positions as of that date. 
 Subsequently, cumulative adverse changes in expected cash flows on our AFS debt securities are recognized currently as an increase to the allowance for credit losses. However, the allowance is limited to the amount by which the AFS debt security s amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Favorable changes in expected cash flows are first recognized as a decrease to the allowance for credit losses (recognized currently in earnings). Such changes would be recognized as a prospective yield adjustment only when the allowance for credit losses is reduced to zero. A change in expected cash flows that is attributable solely to a change in a variable interest reference rate does not result in a credit loss and is accounted for as a prospective yield adjustment.

 Investments of Consolidated Affordable Housing Fund 
 On November 5, 2021, we established Woodstar Portfolio Holdings, LLC (the Woodstar Fund ), an investment fund which holds our Woodstar multifamily affordable housing portfolios consisting of properties with units located in Central and South Florida. As managing member of the Woodstar Fund, we manage interests purchased by third party investors seeking capital appreciation and an ongoing return, for which we earn (i) a management fee based on each investor s share of total Woodstar Fund equity; and (ii) an incentive distribution if the Woodstar Fund s returns exceed an established threshold. In connection with the establishment of the Woodstar Fund, we entered into subscription and other related agreements with certain third party institutional investors to sell, through a feeder fund structure, an aggregate interest in the Woodstar Fund for an initial aggregate subscription price of million, which was adjusted to million post-closing. The Woodstar Fund has an initial term of . 
 
 Effective with the third party interest sale, the Woodstar Fund has the characteristics of an investment company under ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies. Accordingly, the Woodstar Fund is required to carry the investments in its properties at fair value, with a cumulative effect adjustment between the fair value and previous carrying value of its investments recognized in stockholders equity as of November 5, 2021, the date of the Woodstar Fund s change in status to an investment company. Such cumulative effect adjustment amounted to billion, as reflected in our consolidated statement of equity for the year ended December 31, 2021. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the Woodstar Fund, which is a VIE (as discussed in Note 16), we consolidate the accounts of the Woodstar Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting for its investments. Realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of the Woodstar Fund s property investments, and distributions thereon, are recognized in the Income from affordable housing fund investments caption within the other income (loss) section of our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 8 for further details regarding the Woodstar Fund s investments and related income and Note 18 with respect to its contingently redeemable non-controlling interests which are classified as Temporary Equity in our consolidated balance sheet.

 Credit Loss Allowances 
 As discussed in Note 2, we do not have a history of realized credit losses on our HFI loans and HTM securities, so we have subscribed to third party database services to provide us with industry losses for both commercial real estate and infrastructure loans. Using these losses as a benchmark, we determine expected credit losses for our loans and securities on a collective basis within our commercial real estate and infrastructure portfolios. 
 For our commercial loans, we utilize a loan loss model that is widely used among banks and commercial mortgage REITs and is marketed by a leading CMBS data analytics provider. It employs logistic regression to forecast expected losses at the loan level based on a commercial real estate loan securitization database that contains activity dating back to 1998. We provide specific loan-level inputs which include loan-to-stabilized-value LTV and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) metrics, as well as principal balances, property type, location, coupon, origination year, term, subordination, expected repayment dates and future fundings. We also select from a group of independent five-year macroeconomic forecasts included in the model that are updated regularly based on current economic trends. We categorize the results by LTV range, which we consider the most significant indicator of credit quality for our commercial loans, as set forth in the credit quality indicator table below. A lower LTV ratio typically indicates a lower credit loss risk. 
 The macroeconomic forecasts do not differentiate among property types or asset classes. Instead, these forecasts reference general macroeconomic growth factors which apply broadly across all assets. For instance, although the office sector has been adversely affected by the increase in remote working arrangements and the retail sector has been adversely affected by electronic commerce, the broad macroeconomic forecasts do not account for such differentiation. Accordingly, we have selected a more adverse macroeconomic recovery forecast related to office and retail properties in determining our credit loss allowance. 
 For our infrastructure loans, we utilize a database of historical infrastructure loan performance that is shared among a consortium of banks and other lenders and compiled by a major bond credit rating agency. The database is representative of

 Non-Credit Deteriorated Loans 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had the following loans with a combined amortized cost basis of million that were 90 days or greater past due at December 31, 2022: (i) a million leasehold mortgage loan on a luxury resort in California destroyed by wildfire; (ii) million of residential loans; and (iii) a million loan on a hospitality asset in New York that our Investing and Servicing Segment acquired as nonperforming in October 2021. All of these loans were on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2022. We also had the following loans on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2022: (i) a million senior loan on a retail and entertainment project in New Jersey, of which million was converted into equity interests (see Note 9); and (ii) a million mezzanine loan on an office property in Hawaii for which we were repaid at par subsequent to year end. None of these loans are considered credit deteriorated as we presently expect to recover all amounts due. 
 Credit Deteriorated Loans 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a million subordinated loan secured by a department store in Chicago which was deemed credit deteriorated and is fully reserved.

 million, including million of unpaid interest prior to the loan being placed on nonaccrual in January 2022. In connection with the foreclosure, we reclassified the million carrying value of the loan (representing our acquisition cost of the underlying land and building) to properties in accordance with the asset acquisition provisions of ASC 805. 
 
 In December 2022, a senior loan participation secured by a natural gas-fired power plant in Massachusetts was converted to a equity interest in the borrower. The net carrying value of the loan converted was million, net of a credit loss allowance of million (of which million and million was provided during 2022 and 2021, respectively). In connection with the conversion, we reclassified the million net carrying value of the loan to investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 In May 2022, we obtained control over the pledged equity interests of a mezzanine borrower entity related to an office building located in Texas, which resulted in our consolidating the mezzanine borrower entity including the underlying property collateral and related debt. The net carrying value of our loans related to this property totaled million and consisted of first mortgage and mezzanine loans which are now eliminated in consolidation. In connection with the consolidation of the mezzanine borrower entity, we recorded properties of million, lease intangible assets of million, net working capital of million and third-party first mortgage debt of million in accordance with the asset acquisition provisions of ASC 805. 
 In April 2021, we foreclosed on certain credit deteriorated loans related to a residential conversion project located in New York City, which resulted in our obtaining physical possession of the underlying collateral. The net carrying value of the loans related to this project totaled million and consisted of: (i) a first mortgage and mezzanine loan with a net carrying value of million, for which we consolidated the underlying property collateral in October 2020 when we obtained control over certain pledged equity interests of the borrower; and (ii) a first mortgage loan with a net carrying value of million that was not subject to the pledged equity interests and thus continued to be reflected as a loan on our consolidated balance sheet until the April 2021 foreclosure.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were securities and security, respectively, with unrealized losses reflected in the table above. After evaluating the securities, we concluded that the unrealized losses reflected above were noncredit-related and would be recovered from the securities estimated future cash flows. We considered a number of factors in reaching this conclusion, including that we did not intend to sell the securities, it was not considered more likely than not that we would be forced to sell the securities prior to recovering our amortized cost, and there were no material credit events that would have caused us to otherwise conclude that we would not recover our cost. Credit losses, if any, are calculated by comparing (i) the estimated future cash flows of each security discounted at the yield determined as of the initial acquisition date or, if since revised, as of the last date previously revised, to (ii) our net amortized cost basis. Significant judgment is used in projecting cash flows for our non-agency RMBS. As a result, actual income and/or credit losses could be materially different from what is currently projected and/or reported. 
 CMBS and RMBS, Fair Value Option 
 As discussed in the Fair Value Option section of Note 2 herein, we elect the fair value option for certain CMBS and RMBS in an effort to eliminate accounting mismatches resulting from the current or potential consolidation of securitization VIEs. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of CMBS where we have elected the fair value option, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of securitization VIEs, were billion and billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of RMBS where we have elected the fair value option, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of securitization VIEs, were million and million, respectively. The billion total fair value balance of CMBS and RMBS represents our economic interests in these assets. However, as a result of our consolidation of securitization VIEs, the vast majority of this fair value (all except million at December 31, 2022) is eliminated against VIE liabilities before arriving at our GAAP balance for fair value option investment securities. 
 As of December 31, 2022, million of our CMBS were variable rate and of our RMBS were variable rate.

 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021 represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired on September 19, 2018 and October 15, 2018. The goodwill recognized is attributable to value embedded in the acquired Infrastructure Lending Segment s lending platform and is fully tax deductible over years. 
 
 As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Based on our quantitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that the fair value of the Infrastructure Lending Segment reporting unit to which goodwill is attributed exceeded its carrying value including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that the goodwill attributed to the Infrastructure Lending Segment was not impaired.

 The Investing and Servicing Segment s goodwill of million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021 represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of LNR acquired on April 19, 2013.

The tax deductible component of this goodwill as of April 19, 2013 was million and is deductible over years. 
 
 Based on our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which goodwill is attributed is less than its carrying value including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that the goodwill attributed to the Investing and Servicing Segment was not impaired.

 We also hold controlling interests in other non-securitization entities that are considered VIEs. The Woodstar Fund, Woodstar Feeder Fund, L.P. and one of the Woodstar Fund s indirect investees, SPT Dolphin Intermediate LLC SPT Dolphin ), the entity which holds the Woodstar II Portfolio, are each VIEs because the third party interest holders do not carry kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of those VIEs because we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and a significant economic interest in each entity. The Woodstar Fund had total assets of billion, including its indirect investment in SPT Dolphin, and significant liabilities as of December 31, 2022.

 In addition to the above non-securitization entities, we have smaller VIEs with total assets of million and liabilities of million as of December 31, 2022. 
 VIEs in which we are not the Primary Beneficiary 
 In certain instances, we hold a variable interest in a VIE in the form of CMBS, but either (i) we are not appointed, or do not serve as, special servicer or servicing administrator or (ii) an unrelated third party has the rights to unilaterally remove us as special servicer without cause. In these instances, we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. In other cases, the variable interest we hold does not obligate us to absorb losses or provide us with the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant. For these structures, we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and we do not consolidate these VIEs. 
 As noted above, we are not obligated to provide, nor have we provided, any financial support for any of our securitization VIEs, whether or not we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As such, the risk associated with our involvement in these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity.

It also excludes (1) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (2) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders equity shown in our consolidated financial statements.

 The incentive fee is an amount, not less than , equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) and (y) the difference between (i) our Core Earnings for the previous period, and (ii) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of our public offerings and including issue price per equity security of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding (including any RSUs, any RSAs and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans) and equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties in such previous period, and (B) , and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first calendar quarters of such previous period. One half of each quarterly installment of the incentive fee is payable in shares of our common stock so long as the ownership of such additional number of shares by our Manager would not violate the stock ownership limit set forth in our charter, after giving effect to any waiver from such limit that our board of directors may grant in the future.

 Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries 
 As discussed in Note 2, on November 5, 2021 we sold a non-controlling interest in the Woodstar Fund to third party investors for net cash proceeds of million.
