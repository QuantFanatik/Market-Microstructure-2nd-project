General 

Rush Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated in Texas in 1965 and consists of one reportable segment, the Truck Segment, and conducts business through its subsidiaries. Our principal offices are located at 555 IH 35 South, Suite 500, New Braunfels, Texas 78130. 

We are a full-service, integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services. The Truck Segment includes our operation of a network of commercial vehicle dealerships under the name Rush Truck Centers. Rush Truck Centers primarily sell commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Ford, Isuzu, IC Bus and Blue Bird. Through our strategically located network of Rush Truck Centers, we provide one-stop service for the needs of our commercial vehicle customers, including retail sales of new and used commercial vehicles, aftermarket parts sales, service and repair facilities, financing, leasing and rental, and insurance products. 

Our Rush Truck Centers are principally located in high traffic areas throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. Since commencing operations as a Peterbilt heavy-duty truck dealer in 1966, we have grown to operate over 125 franchised Rush Truck Centers in 23 states. In 2019, we purchased a 50 equity interest in an entity in Canada, Rush Truck Centres of Canada Limited RTC Canada and on May 2, 2022, we purchased an additional 30 equity interest in RTC Canada that increased our equity interest to 80 . RTC Canada currently owns and operates 15 International dealership locations in Ontario. Prior to acquiring the additional 30 , we accounted for the equity interest in RTC Canada using the equity method of accounting. Now, the operating results of RTC Canada are consolidated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheets and commercial vehicle unit sales data as of May 2, 2022. 

Our business strategy consists of providing solutions to the commercial vehicle industry through our network of commercial vehicle dealerships. We offer an integrated approach to meeting customer needs by providing service, parts and collision repairs in addition to new and used commercial vehicle sales and leasing, plus financial services, vehicle upfitting, CNG fuel systems through our joint venture with Cummins and vehicle telematics products. We intend to continue to implement our business strategy, reinforce customer loyalty and remain a market leader by continuing to develop our Rush Truck Centers as we expand our product offerings and extend our dealership network through strategic acquisitions of new locations and opening new dealerships in our existing areas of operation to enable us to better serve our customers.

Industry 

See Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Industry for a description of our industry and the markets in which we operate. 

Our Business Strategy 

Operating Strategy. Our strategy is to operate an integrated dealership network that provides service solutions to the commercial vehicle industry throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. Our strategy includes the following key elements: 

Management by Dealership Units . At each of our dealerships, we operate one or more of the following departments: new commercial vehicle sales, used commercial vehicle sales, financial services, parts, service or a collision center. Our general managers measure and manage the operations of each dealership according to the specific departments operating at that location. We believe that this system enhances the profitability of all aspects of a dealership and increases our overall operating margins. Operating goals for each department at each of our dealerships are established annually and managers are rewarded for performance relative to these goals. 

One-Stop Centers . We have developed our larger commercial vehicle dealerships as one-stop centers that offer an integrated approach to meeting customer needs. We provide service, including collision repairs, parts, new and used commercial vehicles sales, leasing and rental, plus financial services including finance and insurance. We believe that this full-service strategy helps to mitigate cyclical economic fluctuations because our parts, service and collision center operations (referred to herein collectively as Aftermarket Products and Services at our dealerships generally tend to be less volatile than our new and used commercial vehicle sales. 

Aftermarket Products and Services . Our aftermarket capabilities include a wide range of services and products, including a fleet of mobile service units, mobile technicians who work in our customers facilities, technology solutions, including vehicle telematics support, a proprietary line of parts and accessories, and factory-certified service for assembly services for specialized bodies and equipment. We believe that offering a variety of Aftermarket Products and Services at our dealerships and other locations allows us to meet the expanding needs of our customers. We continually strive to leverage our dealership network to offer more products and services to our customers. 

Branding Program . We employ a branding program at all of our dealerships through distinctive signage and uniform marketing programs to take advantage of our existing name recognition and to communicate the standardized high quality of our products and reliability of our services throughout our dealership network. 

Growth Strategy. Through our strategic expansion and acquisition initiatives, we have grown to operate a large, multistate/international, full-service network of commercial vehicle dealerships. As described below, we intend to continue to grow our business by expanding our product and service offerings through acquisitions in new geographic areas and by opening new locations to enable us to better serve our customers. 

Expansion of Product and Service Offerings . We intend to continue to expand our product lines within our existing locations by adding product categories and service capabilities that are both complementary to our existing product lines and well suited to our operating model. We will continue to take advantage of technological advances that will provide us with the opportunity to offer vehicle owners more aftermarket options and the ability to maximize the performance of vehicles in their fleets using telematics and other technologies. 

Expansion Into New Geographic Areas . We plan to continue to expand our dealership network by acquiring existing dealerships or opening new locations in areas where we do not already have locations. We believe the geographic diversity of our Rush Truck Center network has significantly expanded our customer base while reducing the effects of local economic cycles.

Open New Rush Truck Centers in Existing Areas of Operation . We continually evaluate opportunities to increase our market presence by adding new Rush Truck Centers within our current franchises areas of operation. 

Management of Our Dealerships 

Rush Truck Centers 

Our Rush Truck Centers are responsible for sales of new and used commercial vehicles, as well as related Aftermarket Products and Services. 

Aftermarket Products and Services . Revenues from Aftermarket Products and Services accounted for approximately 2,372.4 million, or 33.4 , of our total revenues for 2022, and 61.7 of our gross profit. Rush Truck Centers carry a wide variety of commercial vehicle parts in inventory. Certain Rush Truck Centers also feature fully equipped service and collision center facilities, the combination and configuration of which varies by location, capable of handling a broad range of repairs on most commercial vehicles. Each Rush Truck Center with a service department is a warranty service center for the commercial vehicle manufacturers represented at that location, if any, and most are also authorized service centers for other vehicle component manufacturers, including Cummins, Eaton, Caterpillar and Allison. We also have mobile service technicians and technicians who staff our customers facilities upon request. 

Our service departments perform warranty and non-warranty repairs on commercial vehicles. The cost of warranty work is generally reimbursed by the applicable manufacturer at retail commercial rates. Warranty-related parts and service revenues accounted for approximately 135.0 million, or 1.9 , of our total revenues for 2022. Additionally, we provide a wide array of services, including assembly services for specialized commercial vehicle bodies and commercial vehicle mounted equipment. Our goal is to provide our customers with any service that they need related to their commercial vehicles. 

As part of our leasing and rental operations, we also enter into contracts to provide full-service maintenance on certain customers vehicles. We had 1,839 vehicles under contract maintenance as of December 31, 2022. The full-service maintenance revenues and retail service revenues are included as Aftermarket Products and Services revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 

New Commercial Vehicle Sales . New commercial vehicle sales represent the largest portion of our revenues, accounting for approximately 3,798.5 million, or 53.5 , of our total revenues in 2022. Of this total, new Class 8 heavy-duty truck sales accounted for approximately 2,715.3 million, or 38.2 , of our total revenues for 2022, and 71.5 of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2022. 

Our Rush Truck Centers that sell new and used Class 8 heavy-duty trucks manufactured by Peterbilt or International may also sell medium-duty and light-duty commercial vehicles. Certain Rush Truck Centers sell medium-duty commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, Hino, Isuzu, Ford, International or Dennis Eagle, buses manufactured by Blue Bird, IC Bus or Elkhart and light-duty commercial vehicles manufactured by Ford (see Part I, Item 1, General Rush Truck Centers for information on which brands we sell at each Rush Truck Center). New medium-duty commercial vehicle sales, excluding new bus sales, accounted for approximately 830.9 million, or 11.7 , of our total revenues for 2022, and 21.9 of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2022. New bus sales accounted for approximately 128.2 million, or 1.8 , of our total revenues for 2022, and 3.4 of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2022. New light-duty commercial vehicle sales accounted for approximately 104.0 million, or 1.5 , of our total revenues for 2022, and 2.7 of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2022. 

A significant portion of our new commercial vehicle sales are to customers with large fleets of commercial vehicles. Because of the size and geographic scope of our Rush Truck Center network, our strong relationships with our fleet customers and our ability to manage large quantities of used commercial vehicle trade-ins, we are able to successfully market and sell to fleet customers nationwide. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over many dealerships because we can absorb multi-unit trade-ins often associated with fleet sales and effectively disperse the used commercial vehicles for resale throughout our dealership network. We believe that the broad range of products and services we offer to purchasers of commercial vehicles at the time of purchase and post-purchase results in a high level of customer loyalty.

Table of Contents 

Used Commercial Vehicle Sales . Used commercial vehicle sales accounted for approximately 552.9 million, or 7.8 , of our total revenues for 2022. We sell used commercial vehicles at most of our Rush Truck Centers and also at our non-franchised used commercial vehicle facilities. We believe that we are well positioned to market used commercial vehicles due to our ability to recondition them for resale utilizing the service and collision center departments of our Rush Truck Centers and our ability to move used commercial vehicles between our dealerships as customer demand warrants. The majority of our used commercial vehicle inventory consists of commercial vehicles taken as trade-ins from new commercial vehicle customers or retired from our lease and rental fleet, but we also supplement our used commercial vehicle inventory by purchasing used commercial vehicles from third parties for resale, as market conditions warrant. 

Vehicle Leasing and Rental . Vehicle leasing and rental revenues accounted for approximately 322.3 million, or 4.5 , of our total revenues for 2022. At our Rush Truck Leasing locations, we engage in full-service commercial vehicle leasing and rental through our PacLease and Idealease franchises. As of December 31, 2022, we had 9,957 commercial vehicles in our lease and rental fleet. Generally, we sell commercial vehicles that have been retired from our lease and rental fleet through our used commercial vehicles sales operations. Historically, we have realized gains on the sale of used lease and rental fleet inventory. 

New and Used Commercial Vehicle Financing and Insurance . The sale of financial and insurance products accounted for approximately 29.7 million, or 0.4 , of our total revenues for 2022. Finance and insurance revenues have minimal direct costs and therefore, contribute a disproportionate share to our operating profits. 

Many of our Rush Truck Centers have personnel responsible for arranging third-party financing for our product offerings. Generally, commercial vehicle finance contracts involve an installment contract, which is secured by the commercial vehicle financed and requires a down payment, with the remaining balance generally financed over a two-year to seven-year period. The majority of these finance contracts are sold to third parties without recourse to us. We provide an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties that we may incur under these finance contracts. 

We sell, as agent, a complete line of property and casualty insurance to commercial vehicle owners. Our agency, which operates at locations around the United States outside of our Rush Truck Centers, is licensed to sell commercial vehicle liability, collision and comprehensive, workers compensation, cargo, and credit life insurance coverage offered by a number of leading insurance companies. Our renewal rate in 2022 was approximately 80 . We also have licensed insurance agents at several of our Rush Truck Centers. 

Human Capital Management 

On December 31, 2022, we employed 7,418 people in the U.S. and 621 in Canada. Of these employees, less than 1.3 of our workforce was classified as part-time. We do not regularly use independent contractors in our business operations. We strive to provide our employees with the security of long-term employment, competitive compensation and benefits, a consistent work schedule and opportunities to improve their skills and advance within the Company. 

Core Values. Our core values define our culture and reflect who we are and the way we interact with our customers, suppliers, co-workers and shareholders. Our core values are productivity, fairness, excellence and positive attitude and are described below. 

Productivity means constantly striving toward efficiency and success in all interactions and activities while working with a common purpose and sense of urgency. 

Fairness characterizes our honesty, integrity, truthfulness, dependability and reliability in everything we do. 

Excellence means doing it better than everyone else does. Excellence is reflected in our first-class facilities, quality products and services, motivated and talented employees, superior results for the customer and consistency throughout our organization. 

Positive Attitude means approaching every day with excitement and passion for the work and dedication to our customers with positive intensity. 

13

Table of Contents 

Each of these core values is embodied in our code of conduct, which we call our Rush Driving Principles. Employees are required to attend training on the Rush Driving Principles and certify that they have read and understand such principles on an annual basis. We believe that our core values are the foundation of a strong and ethical culture that is a strength for us, and we intend to continue building upon that culture to improve performance across our business. 

Employee Recruitment. We strive to attract the best talent from a variety of sources to meet the current and future needs of our business. We have established relationships with multiple trade schools and universities across the country, which we utilize as a source for entry-level talent. Additionally, we believe it is incumbent upon all our managers to continuously monitor their local markets for experienced individuals who might be successful additions to our organization. 

Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward employees who must operate in a highly competitive, fast-paced environment. In general, our compensation programs consist of a base salary or hourly rate, commissions for employees in front-line customer facing roles, cash performance bonuses for certain employees, equity incentive awards for senior leaders, vacation leave, sick leave and other forms of paid time off. 

We are committed to fair pay. In 2020, the Company established a minimum hourly wage of 15.00 an hour. Our employees receive a base level of monthly or hourly compensation that we believe is commensurate with their expertise, skills, knowledge, experience and location. 

We provide our full-time employees with comprehensive benefit options that allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide-ranging benefits offered are: medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, smoking cessation assistance program, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. 

We also provide our employees with an opportunity to participate in the ownership of the Company by offering an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their base earnings every six months toward the semi-annual purchase of the Company s Class A common stock. Employees participating in the stock purchase plan receive a 15 discount on the purchase price of the stock, with such discount based on lesser of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the first business day or the last business day of the semi-annual offering period. In addition, we provide our employees with an opportunity to save for retirement by participating in our 401k plan, which has a Company-matching component that is based on years of service. 

Training and Development. Our training and development programs are designed to facilitate the development and advancement of talent from within our organization to ensure we continuously fill our ranks with qualified employees for critical positions in the organization. These programs also seek to provide our employees with the career development skills they desire and further our employee retention efforts. Members of our Learning and Development team collaborate with employees from our various operations teams to identify our strategic training needs and prioritize the development of appropriate training content related to systems, processes, new hire and professional development. 

Our Rush Foundational Leader Program is focused on developing key management and leadership skills. The Rush Foundational Leader Program consists of a series of courses ranging from basic management skills, including promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion, to more advanced leadership concepts and skills that are designed for managers throughout our organization. As a continuation of our leadership development initiatives, we have launched our High Impact Leadership series, which focuses on building more advanced leadership skills such as motivating employees through meaningful feedback and inclusive leadership and communication. We also have a New Graduate Management Trainee Program that identifies and recruits new talent from universities across the country and provides on-the-job training for them to fill various roles within our dealership network. In addition, we have established a program called Growing Rush Outstanding Women ("GROW"), which enables women to continue their professional development through educational opportunities. 

To enhance and develop the technical skills of entry-level service and body shop technicians, we established a formal mentorship program lead by experienced service and body shop technicians who serve as mentors to newly hired, entry level service and body shop technicians. We believe that this program increases the technicians likelihood of career success. This formal mentorship program also helps us identify top performers and we believe it improves employee performance and retention for participants in the program. 

Ethics and Compliance. We are committed to the highest standards of corporate conduct. We maintain an Ethics and Compliance Program that is designed to meet external requirements, as well as our core values and code of conduct embodied in the Rush Driving Principles. A central component of our Ethics and Compliance Program is the continuous training and education of our employees on general ethics and compliance training topics. We also regularly reinforce our commitment to ethics and integrity in communications with our employees.

Employee Engagement and Retention. We conduct an annual comprehensive employee engagement survey designed to measure organizational culture and engagement. The purpose of the survey is to monitor overall employee engagement with the goal of identifying actions that can be taken to continuously improve our employee engagement, which we believe leads to increased employee retention. Data collected in each annual employee engagement survey is maintained and used to track our progress against our internal goals. Additionally, we have formal listening groups that provide additional engagement channels for feedback from our dealerships to senior management throughout the year. 

Management continually monitors employee turnover data, which is supplemented with additional data from exit surveys to assist in determining the reasons for voluntary employee terminations. In 2022, our overall turnover rate was 30.38 , compared to 27.49 in 2021. The turnover rate of our service and body shop technicians is also monitored closely by management, as the retention of skilled service and body shop technicians is critical to the success of the Company. Demand for service and body shop technicians across the country is very high, and turnover in this role is also traditionally high for commercial vehicle dealers. In 2022, our turnover rate for service and body shop technicians was 38.7 , compared to 36.67 in 2021. 

Health and Safety. Promoting a safe and healthy workplace is our highest priority and is embodied in our core values. We utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of our operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") and the Lost Time (or Lost Workday) Incident Rate ("LTIR") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours). Leading indicators include training completion rates, tracking of local safety committee meeting minutes, and recording of near misses, as well as other proactive actions taken to ensure employee safety. In 2022, we had a TRIR of 4.03, compared to 3.87 in 2021 and a LTIR of 0.62 in 2022, compared to 0.71 in 2021. 

Labor Relations. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements covering certain employees in Chicago, Illinois, which will expire on May 10, 2025, Joliet, Illinois, which will expire on May 3, 2026 and Carol Stream, Illinois, which will expire on May 6, 2023. There have been no strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns during the negotiations of the foregoing collective bargaining agreements or at any time in the Company s history, although no assurances can be given that such actions will not occur. We believe that our relations with the labor unions that represent these employees are generally good. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our established history of operations in the commercial vehicle business has resulted in a strong customer base that is diverse in terms of geography, industry and scale of operations. Our customers include national and regional truck fleets, corporations, local and state governments and owner-operators. During 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our sales by dollar volume. We generally promote our products and related services through direct customer contact by our sales personnel and advertising. 

Facility Management 

Personnel. Each of our facilities is typically managed by a general manager who oversees the operations, personnel and the financial performance of the location, subject to the direction of a regional manager and personnel at our corporate headquarters. Additionally, each full-service Rush Truck Center is typically staffed by department managers, sales representatives and other employees, as appropriate, given the services offered. The sales staff of each Rush Truck Center is compensated on a salary plus commission, or a commission only basis, while department managers receive a combination of salary and performance bonus. We believe that our employees are among the highest paid in the industry, which enables us to attract and retain qualified personnel. 

Compliance with Policies and Procedures. Each Rush Truck Center is audited regularly for compliance with corporate policies and procedures. These internal audits objectively measure dealership performance with respect to corporate expectations in the management and administration of sales, commercial vehicle inventory, parts inventory, parts sales, service sales, collision center sales, corporate policy compliance and environmental and safety compliance matters.

Purchasing and Suppliers. Because of our size and the corresponding cost savings we provide, we benefit from volume purchases at favorable prices that permit us to achieve a competitive pricing position in the industry. We purchase our commercial vehicle inventory and proprietary parts and accessories directly from the applicable vehicle manufacturer, wholesale distributors, or other sources that provide the most favorable pricing. Most purchasing commitments are negotiated by personnel at our corporate headquarters. Historically, we have been able to negotiate favorable pricing levels and terms, which enable us to offer competitive prices for our products. 

Commercial Vehicle Inventory Management. We utilize our management information systems to monitor the inventory level of commercial vehicles at each of our dealerships and transfer new and used commercial vehicle inventory among Rush Truck Centers as needed. 

Parts Distribution and Inventory Management. We utilize a parts inventory distribution and management system that allows for the prompt transfer of parts inventory among various Rush Truck Centers. The transfer of inventory reduces delays in delivery, helps maximize inventory turns and assists in controlling problems created by overstock and understock situations. Our network is linked to our major suppliers for purposes of ordering parts and managing parts inventory levels. Automated reordering and communication systems allow us to maintain proper parts inventory levels and permit us to have parts inventory delivered to our locations, or directly to customers, typically within 24 hours of an order being placed. 

Recent Acquisitions 

On February 25, 2019, we acquired 50 of the equity interest in RTC Canada, which acquired the operating assets of Tallman Group, the largest International Truck dealer in Canada. On May 2, 2022, we acquired an additional 30 equity interest for approximately 20.0 million. Prior to acquiring our additional equity interest, we accounted for the equity interest in RTC Canada using the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the Company s acquisition of the additional 30 equity interest on May 2, 2022, the operating results of RTC Canada are consolidated in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

On December 13, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain of the assets of Summit Truck Group, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, Summit ), which included full-service commercial vehicle dealerships and Idealease franchises in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. The acquisition included Summit s dealerships representing International, IC Bus, Idealease, Isuzu and other commercial vehicle manufacturers for a purchase price of approximately 205.3 million, excluding the real property associated with the transaction. We financed approximately 102.0 million of the purchase price under our floor plan and lease and rental truck financing arrangements and the remainder was paid in cash. In addition, we purchased certain real estate owned by Summit for a purchase price of approximately 57.0 million, which was paid in cash. 

See Note 15 Acquisitions in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Competition 

There is, and will continue to be, significant competition both within our current markets and in new markets we may enter. We anticipate that competition between us and other dealership groups will continue to increase in our current markets and on a national level based on the following: 

the ability to keep customers vehicles operational, which is dependent on the accessibility of dealership locations and the ability to attract and retain service technicians; 

the number of dealership locations representing the manufacturers that we represent and other manufacturers, which impacts manufacturers ability to provide more consistent, higher quality service in a timely manner across their dealership networks; 

price, value, quality and design of the products sold; and 

our attention to customer service (including technical service). 

Our dealerships compete with dealerships representing other manufacturers, including commercial vehicles manufactured by Mack, Freightliner, Kenworth and Volvo. We believe that our dealerships are able to compete with other franchised dealerships, independent service centers, parts wholesalers, commercial vehicle wholesalers, rental service companies and industrial auctioneers in distributing our products and providing service because of the following: the overall quality and reputation of the products we sell; the Rush brand name recognition and reputation for quality service; the geographic scope of our dealership network; the breadth of commercial vehicles offered in our dealership network; and our ability to provide comprehensive Aftermarket Products and Services, as well as financing, insurance and other customer services.

Dealership Agreements 

Peterbilt. We have entered into nonexclusive dealership agreements with Peterbilt that authorize us to act as a dealer of Peterbilt heavy- and medium-duty trucks. Our Peterbilt areas of responsibility currently encompass areas in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. These dealership agreements currently have terms expiring in May 2023. Our dealership agreements with Peterbilt may be terminated by Peterbilt in the event that the aggregate voting power of W.M. Rusty Rush, certain other members of the Rush family and certain executives of the Company decreases below 22 . Sales of new Peterbilt commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 31.9 of our total revenues for 2022. 

International. We have entered into nonexclusive dealership agreements with Navistar that authorize us to act as a dealer of International heavy- and medium-duty trucks and, in certain markets, IC buses. Our Navistar areas of responsibility currently encompass areas in the states of Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia. These dealership agreements currently have terms expiring between May 2023 and December 2027. Sales of new International commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 13.6 of our total revenues for 2022. 

Other Commercial Vehicle Suppliers. In addition to our dealership agreements with Peterbilt and Navistar, various Rush Truck Centers have entered into dealership agreements with other commercial vehicle manufacturers, including Blue Bird, and Micro Bird, which currently have terms expiring between August 2023 and August 2024 and Ford, Hino, Isuzu and Dennis Eagle, which have perpetual terms. Sales of new non Peterbilt and non-International commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 8.0 of our total revenues for 2022. 

All of our dealership agreements impose certain operational obligations and financial requirements upon us and the relevant dealerships. In addition, each of our dealership agreements requires the consent of the relevant manufacturer for the sale or transfer of a franchise. 

Any termination or nonrenewal of our dealership agreements must follow certain guidelines established by both state and federal legislation designed to protect motor vehicle dealers from arbitrary termination or nonrenewal of franchise agreements. The federal Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act and certain other similar state laws generally provide that the termination or nonrenewal of a motor vehicle dealership agreement must be done in good faith and upon a showing of good cause by the manufacturer for such termination or nonrenewal, as such terms have been defined by statute and interpreted in case law. 

Floor Plan Financing 

Most of our commercial vehicle purchases are made on terms requiring payment to the manufacturer within 15 days or less from the date the commercial vehicles are invoiced from the factory. On September 14, 2021, we entered into our floor plan credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. BMO Harris (the Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the lenders signatory thereto. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement includes an aggregate loan commitment of 1.0 billion. Borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to (A) the greater of (i) zero and (ii) one month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), determined on the last day of the prior month, plus (B) 1.10 and are payable monthly. Loans under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement for the purchase of used inventory are limited to 150.0 million and loans for working capital purposes are limited to 200.0 million. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026, although BMO Harris has the right to terminate at any time upon 360 days written notice and we may terminate at any time, subject to specified limited exceptions. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 762.9 million outstanding under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. The average daily outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement were 638.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. We utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross interest expense under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

On July 15, 2022, RTC Canada entered into that certain Amended and Restated BMO Wholesale Financing and Security Agreement (the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement with Bank of Montreal BMO ). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to 116.7 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance RTC Canada s purchase of new and used vehicle inventory. Loans to purchase used vehicle inventory are limited to twenty percent (20 of the credit limit available at such time. RTC Canada may borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the credit limits set forth above with respect to new and used vehicles. Advances under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the first business day of each calendar month, at the Canadian Offered Dollar Rate CDOR ), plus 0.90 and in the case of an advance required to be made in USD dollars, at LIBOR, plus 1.10 . The RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement expires September 14, 2026. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 44.6 million outstanding under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement. 

Lease and Rental Fleet Financing 

On September 14, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders signatory thereto (the WF Lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association WF ), as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the WF Agent which was amended effective November 30, 2022 (collectively, the WF Credit Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement, the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to 175.0 million of revolving credit loans for certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for our Idealease leasing and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. We expect to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for our Idealease lease and rental fleet. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the WF Credit Agreement from time to time until the maturity date. Borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on each interest payment date, as defined in the WF Credit Agreement, at (A) the daily simple, secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus (i) 1.25 or (ii) 1.5 , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or (B) on or after the term SOFR transition date, the term SOFR plus (i) 1.25 or (ii) 1.5 , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The WF Credit Agreement expires on September 14, 2024, although, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the WF Agent has the right to, or upon the request of the required lenders must, terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding principal and interest due and payable. We may terminate the commitments at any time. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 40.5 million outstanding under the WF Credit Agreement. 

On October 1, 2021, the Company entered into that certain Amended and Restated Inventory Financing and Purchase Money Security Agreement with PACCAR Leasing Company PLC ), a division of PACCAR Financial Corp. (the PLC Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the PLC Agreement, PLC agreed to make up to 300.0 million of revolving credit loans to finance certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through our PacLease franchises. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the PLC Agreement from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the borrowing base. Advances under the PLC Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at our option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus 1.55 , provided that the floating rate of interest is subject to a floor of 0 , or (B) a fixed rate, to be determined between us and PLC in each instance of borrowing at a fixed rate. The PLC Agreement expires on October 1, 2025, although either party has the right to terminate the PLC Agreement at any time upon 180 days written notice. If we terminate the PLC Agreement prior to October 1, 2025, then all payments will be deemed to be voluntary prepayments subject to a potential prepayment premium. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 185.0 million outstanding under the PLC Agreement. 

On May 31, 2022, RTC Canada entered into that certain BMO Revolving Lease and Rental Credit Agreement (the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement with BMO. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to 120.0 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance certain of RTC Canada s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through RTC Canada s Idealease franchise, with an additional 20.0 million available upon the request of RTC Canada and consent of BMO. Advances under the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the first business day of each calendar month, at CDOR, plus 1.35 . The RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 49.9 million outstanding under the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement. 

Product Warranties 

The manufacturers we represent provide retail purchasers of their products with a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, excluding certain specified components that are separately warranted by the suppliers of such components. We provide a warranty on our proprietary line of parts and related service and the fuel systems manufactured by our joint venture entity, Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies, and that were previously manufactured by Momentum Fuel Technologies. We also provide an extended warranty beyond the manufacturer s warranty on new Blue Bird school buses that we sell in Texas, as required by state law. 

18

Table of Contents 

We generally sell used commercial vehicles in as is condition without a manufacturer s warranty, although manufacturers sometimes will provide a limited warranty on their used products if such products have been properly reconditioned prior to resale or if the manufacturer s warranty on such product is transferable and has not expired. Although we do not provide any warranty on used commercial vehicles, we offer for sale third-party warranties. 

Trademarks 

The trademarks and trade names of the manufacturers we represent, which are used in connection with our marketing and sales efforts, are subject to limited licenses included in our dealership agreements with each manufacturer. The licenses are for the same periods as our dealership agreements. These trademarks and trade names are widely recognized and are important in the marketing of our products. Each licensor engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection. We hold registered trademarks from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the following names used in this document: Rush Enterprises and Rush Truck Center. 

Seasonality 

Our Truck Segment is moderately seasonal. Seasonal effects on new commercial vehicle sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the diverse geographic locations of our dealerships and our diverse customer base, including regional and national fleets, local and state governments, corporations and owner-operators. However, Aftermarket Products and Services operations historically have experienced higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters. 

Backlog 

On December 31, 2022, our backlog of commercial vehicle orders was approximately 4,216.0 million, compared to a backlog of commercial vehicle orders of approximately 3,267.0 million on December 31, 2021. This increase in our backlog is primarily due to the Summit acquisition and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results, in addition to continuing production constraints experienced by the manufacturers we represent. Our backlog is determined quarterly by multiplying the number of new commercial vehicles for each particular type of commercial vehicle ordered by a customer at our Rush Truck Centers by the recent average selling price for that type of commercial vehicle. We include only confirmed orders in our backlog. However, such orders are subject to cancellation. In the event of order cancellation, we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The delivery time for a custom-ordered commercial vehicle varies depending on the truck specifications and demand for the particular model ordered. We sell the majority of our new heavy-duty commercial vehicles by customer special order and we sell the majority of our medium- and light-duty commercial vehicles out of inventory. Orders from a number of our major fleet customers are included in our backlog as of December 31, 2022, and we expect to fill the majority of our backlog orders during 2023, assuming that the manufacturers we represent can meet their current production schedule. Our current backlog continues to be much higher than normal. Given the potential for industry headwinds in the coming months caused by lower spot rates and higher interest rates, which could negatively impact industry demand for new commercial vehicles moving forward, we believe that the longer it takes to fill our backlog, the greater the risk that a significant amount of commercial vehicle orders currently reflected in our backlog could be cancelled. 

Environmental Standards and Other Governmental Regulations 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the following: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks; the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, petroleum and other materials; and the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts. As with commercial vehicle dealerships generally, and vehicle service, parts and collision center operations in particular, our business involves the generation, use, storage, handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous materials or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations. 

19

Table of Contents 

Our operations involving the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous materials are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Pursuant to these laws, federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of regulated substances with which we must comply. Our business also involves the operation and use of aboveground and underground storage tanks. These storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal under RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks. 

We may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling, treatment, or disposal facilities under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes. These statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of environmental impacts without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the impacts. Responsible parties under these statutes may include the owner or operator of the site where impacts occurred and companies that disposed, or arranged for the disposal, of the hazardous substances released at these sites. These responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other materials into the environment. 

The federal Clean Water Act and comparable state statutes require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances, and require preparation of spill contingency plans. Water quality protection programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state statutes regulate emissions of various air emissions through permitting programs and the imposition of standards and other requirements. 

The Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA ), on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation, issued rules associated with reducing greenhouse gas GHG emissions and improving the fuel efficiency of medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses for current model years through 2027. In addition, in August 2021, the President of the United States issued an executive order intended to increase fuel efficiency, further reduce GHG emissions and speed up the development of zero-emission vehicles. The executive order calls for the EPA and the Secretary of Transportation to adopt new rules and regulations for commercial vehicles starting as early as model year 2027. Similarly, in June 2020, the California Air Resources Board adopted a final rule that is intended to phase out the sale of diesel-powered commercial vehicles over time by requiring a certain percentage of each manufacturer s commercial vehicles sold within the state to be zero-emission vehicles, or near-zero emission vehicles, starting in model year 2024. In addition, in July 2020, a group of fifteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia entered into a joint memorandum of understanding that commits each of them to work together to advance and accelerate the market for electric Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles; two additional states have since signed. Six of the states that signed are states where we operate new commercial vehicle dealerships: California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia. The signatories to the memorandum all agreed on a goal of ensuring that 100 of new Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles are zero emission by 2050, with an interim target of 30 zero emission vehicles by 2030. Attaining these goals would likely require the adoption of new laws and regulations and we cannot predict at this time whether such laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our business. Additional regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or changes in demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We do not believe that we currently have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, soil and groundwater impacts are known to exist at some of our dealerships. Further, environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. In addition, in connection with acquisitions, it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities, some of which may be material. In connection with our dispositions, or prior dispositions made by companies we acquire, we may retain exposure for environmental costs and liabilities, some of which may be material. Compliance with current or amended, or new or more stringent, laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, such laws could affect demand for the products that we sell.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

An investment in our common stock is subject to certain risks inherent to our business. In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, we recommend that you carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. 

Risks Related to Our Business Operations 

We are dependent upon PACCAR for the supply of Peterbilt trucks and parts, the sale of which generates the majority of our revenues. 

At certain Rush Truck Centers, we operate as a dealer of Peterbilt trucks and parts pursuant to dealership agreements with Peterbilt, a division of PACCAR. We have no control over the management or operation of Peterbilt or PACCAR. During 2022, the majority of our revenues resulted from sales of trucks purchased from Peterbilt and parts purchased from PACCAR Parts. Due to our dependence on PACCAR and Peterbilt, we believe that our long-term success depends, in large part, on the following: 

our ability to maintain our dealership agreements with Peterbilt; 

the manufacture and delivery of competitively-priced, technologically current, high-quality Peterbilt trucks in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements; 

the overall success of PACCAR and Peterbilt; 

PACCAR s continuation of its Peterbilt division; and 

the maintenance of goodwill associated with the Peterbilt brand, which can be adversely affected by decisions made by PACCAR, Peterbilt and the owners of other Peterbilt dealerships. 

A negative change in any of the preceding, or a change in control of PACCAR, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues and profitability. 

We are dependent upon Navistar for the supply of International trucks and parts and IC buses and parts, the sale of which generate a significant portion of our revenues. 

At certain Rush Truck Centers, we operate as a dealer of International trucks and parts and IC buses and parts pursuant to dealership agreements with International and IC Bus, each of which are divisions of Navistar. We have no control over the management or operation of International, IC Bus or Navistar. During 2022, a significant portion of our revenues resulted from sales of trucks purchased from International, buses purchased from IC Bus and parts purchased from Navistar. Due to our dependence on Navistar, International and IC Bus, we believe that our long-term success depends, in large part, on the following: 

our ability to maintain our dealership agreements with International and IC Bus; 

the manufacture and delivery of competitively-priced, technologically current, high-quality International trucks and IC buses in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements; 

the overall success of Navistar; and 

the maintenance of goodwill associated with the International and IC Bus brands, which can be adversely affected by decisions made by Navistar and the owners of other International and IC Bus dealerships. 

A negative change in any of the preceding, or a change in control of Navistar, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues and profitability.

Our dealership agreements may be terminable upon a change of control and we cannot control whether our controlling shareholder and management maintain their current ownership positions. 

We have entered into nonexclusive dealership agreements with Peterbilt that authorize us to act as a dealer of Peterbilt trucks. Peterbilt may terminate our dealership agreements in the event of a change of control of the Company or if we violate any number of provisions in the dealership agreements. Under our Peterbilt dealership agreements, the following constitute a change of control: (i) with respect to the election of directors, the aggregate voting power held by W.M. Rusty Rush, Scott Anderson, Steven Keller and Corey Lowe, along with certain other persons who no longer work for the Company (collectively, the Dealer Principals decreases below 22 (the Dealer Principals, excluding those who no longer work for the Company, controlled approximately 44.0 of the aggregate voting power with respect to the election of directors as of December 31, 2022); or (ii) any person or entity other than the Dealer Principals and their respective associates, or any person or entity who has been approved in writing by PACCAR, owns common stock with a greater percentage of the voting power with respect to the election of our directors than the Dealer Principals and their respective associates, in the aggregate, or any person other than Mr. Rush, Robin M. Rush or any person who has been approved in writing by PACCAR holds the office of Chairman of the Board, President or Chief Executive Officer of the Company. We have no control over the transfer or disposition of Mr. Rush s, or his estate s, common stock. If Mr. Rush were to sell his Class B common stock or bequest his Class B common stock to a person or entity other than the Dealer Principals, or if his estate is required to liquidate its Class B common stock this it owns, directly or indirectly, to pay estate taxes or otherwise, the change of control provisions of the Peterbilt dealership agreements may be triggered, which would give Peterbilt the right to terminate our dealership agreements. If our dealership agreements with Peterbilt are terminated, we will lose the right to purchase Peterbilt products and operate as an authorized Peterbilt dealer, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues and profitability. 

Our dealership agreements are non-exclusive and have relatively short terms, which could result in nonrenewal or imposition of less favorable terms upon renewal. 

Our dealership agreements generally do not provide us with exclusive dealerships in any of the areas of responsibility assigned in each dealer agreement. The manufacturers we represent could elect to create additional dealers in our areas of responsibility in the future, subject to restrictions imposed by state laws. While dealership agreements typically restrict dealers from operating franchised sales or service facilities outside their areas of responsibility, such agreements do not restrict sales or marketing activity outside the areas of responsibility. Accordingly, we engage in sales and other marketing activities outside our assigned areas of responsibility and other dealers engage in similar activities within our areas of responsibility. 

Our dealership agreements with the manufacturers we represent have current terms expiring between May 2023 and December 2027. Upon expiration of each agreement, we must negotiate a renewal. Management expects that, consistent with in some cases decades of past practice, each of our dealership agreements will be renewed or otherwise extended before its termination date, provided that we do not breach any of the material terms of such agreement. 

Management attempts to mitigate the risk that any manufacturer would not renew a dealership agreement by providing superior representation of each brand that we represent in each of our areas of responsibility. We deliver superior representation to our manufacturers by continuously investing substantial capital into our dealership locations, marketing and personnel. Senior members of our management team also communicate with management of the manufacturers that we represent on a regular basis, which we believe allows us to identify any potentially problematic issues as early as possible so that we can begin working on mutually agreeable solutions. In addition to the proactive steps that management takes, the risks that our dealership agreements will not be renewed are also mitigated by dealer protection laws that exist in each of the states that our dealerships are located. Many of these state dealer franchise laws restrict manufacturers ability to refuse to renew dealership agreements or to impose new terms upon renewal. However, to the extent such laws did allow for nonrenewal or the imposition of new terms, the relatively short terms would give manufacturers the opportunity to exercise such rights. Any nonrenewal or imposition of less favorable terms upon renewal could have an adverse impact on our business and in the case of the Peterbilt or Navistar dealership agreements, would have an adverse impact on our business.

Our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to successfully execute our strategic initiatives or identify and complete future acquisitions. 

Over the past few years, we have spent significant resources and efforts attempting to grow and enhance our Aftermarket Products and Services business and increase profitability through new business process management initiatives. These efforts require timely and continued investment in technology, facilities, personnel and financial and management systems and controls. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives, which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues, causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected. 

Historically, we have achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises. 

In the long-term, technological advances in the commercial vehicle industry, including drivetrain electrification or other alternative fuel technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The commercial vehicle industry is predicted to experience change over the long-term. We see these changes beginning to occur, as certain of the manufacturers we represent now have vehicles with electric drivetrains available for purchase. Technological advances, including with respect to drivetrain electrification or other alternative fuel technologies, could potentially have a material adverse effect on our parts and service business, as such vehicles are currently being described as potentially requiring less service and having fewer parts. The effect of these technological advances on our business is still uncertain, as there are many factors that are unknowable at this time, including when the infrastructure to support widespread adoption of such vehicles will be in place and when such vehicles may be commercially available at price points that would lead to their widespread adoption. Regardless of where the industry goes with respect to alternative fuel vehicles, we believe that, due to the geographic reach of our dealership network, relationships with both the manufacturers we represent and our customers and our access to capital, we are well-positioned to serve our customers evolving needs. 

Similarly, although we are aware of ongoing efforts to facilitate the development of autonomous commercial vehicles, the eventual timing of the availability of autonomous commercial vehicles is uncertain due to regulatory requirements and additional technological requirements. The effect of autonomous commercial vehicles on the commercial vehicle industry is uncertain and could include changes in the level of new and used commercial vehicles sales, the price of new commercial vehicles, and the role of franchised dealers, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

COVID-19 has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our business, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 

In March 2020, the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. While our Rush Truck Centers have remained operational throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic remains a fluid and evolving situation. Some of the potential impacts to our business that we believe are directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and that we are currently monitoring include, but are not limited to: 

The impact that the pandemic will have on our workforce availability; 

The impact that the pandemic will have on the supply chains of the commercial vehicle manufacturers and parts manufacturers that we represent. We have been informed by the commercial vehicle manufacturers that we represent that production of commercial vehicles in 2023 will be allocated to all of their dealers based on historical purchases. While we do not expect our allocation of commercial vehicles to be less than the number of commercial vehicles we sold in 2022, there is still concern that component manufacturers supply chain issues may limit certain of our commercial vehicle manufacturers ability to meet demand throughout the year; and 

The impact of the pandemic on global capital markets, which depending on future developments, could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. 

The potential impacts that we list above, and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, are likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described herein.

Climate change concerns may impact our business in the future; natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. 

The concerns over climate change may impact our business in the future. Our current business model depends on our ability to sell, and provide services to, commercial vehicles primarily powered by diesel and gasoline internal combustion engines, which result in greenhouse gas emissions. While the manufacturers we represent have made substantial progress in reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that result from internal combustion engines, it is widely accepted that alternative fuel vehicles are necessary to address climate change. Reductions in the sale and use of commercial vehicles powered by internal combustion engines creates risks to our historical business operations and we cannot predict the future costs to our business resulting from these developments. However, we also believe that an industry transition away from internal combustion engines presents significant opportunities for us. Due in large part to the geographic reach of our dealership network, relationships with both the manufacturers we represent and our customers and our access to capital, we believe we are well-positioned to serve our customers evolving needs and help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by helping them integrate more alternative fuel vehicles into their fleets and providing various services related thereto. 

Scientific evidence suggests that a warming climate potentially results in an environment more prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and flooding. To date, we have seen increases in our cost to insure against such risks, which costs could continue to increase should this trend continue. Some of our dealerships are located in regions of the United States where natural disasters and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes and hail storms) may disrupt our operations, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to business interruption, our business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property at dealership locations. Although we have substantial insurance to mitigate this risk, we may be exposed to uninsured or underinsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Risks Related to Financial and Economic Matters 

We may be required to obtain additional financing to maintain adequate inventory levels. 

Our business requires new and used commercial vehicle inventories held for sale to be maintained at dealer locations in order to facilitate immediate sales to customers on demand. We generally purchase new and used commercial vehicle inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing agreements. Our primary floor plan financing agreement, the Floor Plan Credit Agreement, expires on September 14, 2026, and may be terminated without cause upon 360 days notice. In the event that our floor plan financing becomes insufficient to satisfy our future requirements or our floor plan providers are unable to continue to extend credit under our floor plan agreements, we would need to obtain similar financing from other sources. There is no assurance that such additional floor plan financing or alternate financing could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 

Changes in interest rates could have a negative adverse effect on our profitability. 

Our Floor Plan Credit Agreement, RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement, WF Credit Agreement, PLC Agreement and RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement are each subject to variable interest rates. Therefore, our interest expense rises when interest rates increase. Currently, our outstanding borrowings under our Floor Plan Credit Agreement and certain other loan agreements are borrowed at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Although LIBOR is no longer being used to price new loans, LIBOR quotes will be available for existing credit agreements until June 30, 2023. In the event that LIBOR quotes are no longer available, SOFR will replace LIBOR in certain of our credit agreements which currently use LIBOR, including our Floor Plan Credit Agreement. It is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and changes in the method for determining benchmark interest rates may affect our results of operations or financial conditions. However, any rise in interest rates generally may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business, particularly new and used commercial vehicle sales, because many of our customers finance such purchases. As a result, a rise in interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion regarding our interest rate sensitivity.

The dollar amount of our backlog, as stated at any given time, is not necessarily indicative of our future earnings. 

As of December 31, 2022, our backlog of new commercial vehicle orders was approximately 4,216.0 million. Our backlog is determined quarterly by multiplying the number of new commercial vehicles for each particular type of commercial vehicle ordered by a customer at our Rush Truck Centers by the recent average selling price for that type of commercial vehicle. We only include confirmed orders in our backlog. However, such orders are subject to cancellation. In the event of order cancellation, we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. 

Reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons will adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenue and profit we actually receive from orders projected in our backlog. If we were to experience significant cancellations of orders in our backlog, our financial condition could be adversely affected. 

Our current backlog is the largest it has ever been in our Company s history. Given the potential for industry headwinds in the coming months caused by lower spot rates and higher interest rates, which could negatively impact industry demand for new commercial vehicles moving forward, we believe that the longer it takes to fill our backlog, the greater the risk that a significant amount of commercial vehicle orders currently reflected in our backlog could be cancelled. 

Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results. 

We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. Approximately 99 of this goodwill is concentrated in our Truck Segment. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if potential interim indicators exist that could result in impairment. In testing for impairment, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its current fair value as determined based on the discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include weak economic activity, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, any matters that impact the ability of the manufacturers we represent to provide us with commercial vehicles or parts, issues with our franchise rights, or other factors leading to reductions in expected long-term sales or profitability. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit includes developing estimates that are highly subjective and incorporate calculations that are sensitive to minor changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in these assumptions or a change in the Company s reportable segments could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Goodwill for more information regarding the potential impact of changes in assumptions. 

Our business is subject to a number of economic risks 

New and used commercial vehicle retail sales tend to experience periods of decline when general economic conditions worsen. We may experience sustained periods of decreased commercial vehicle sales in the future. Any decline or change of this type could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse regional economic and competitive conditions in the geographic markets in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our commercial vehicle sales volume therefore may differ from industry sales fluctuations. 

Economic conditions and the other factors described above also may materially adversely impact our sales of parts and repair services, and finance and insurance products. 

We depend on relationships with the manufacturers we represent and component suppliers for sales incentives, discounts and similar programs which are material to our operations. 

We depend on the manufacturers we represent and component suppliers for sales incentives, discounts, warranties and other programs that are intended to promote the sales of their commercial vehicles or our use of their components in the vehicles we sell. Most of the incentives and discounts are individually negotiated and not always the same as those made available to commercial vehicle manufacturers or our competitors. These incentives and discounts are material to our operations. A reduction or discontinuation of a commercial vehicle manufacturer s or component supplier s incentive program could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

We are dependent on the ongoing success of the manufacturers we represent and adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers we represent may negatively impact our revenues and profitability. 

The success of each of our dealerships is dependent on the manufacturers represented at each dealership. Our ability to sell new vehicles that satisfy our customers demands and replacement parts is dependent on the ability of the manufacturers we represent to produce and deliver new vehicles and replacement parts to our dealerships. Additionally, our dealerships perform warranty work for vehicles under manufacturer product warranties, which are billed to the appropriate vehicle manufacturer or component supplier as opposed to invoicing our customer. We generally have significant receivables from vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers for warranty and service work performed for our customers. In addition, we rely on vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers to varying extents for product training, marketing materials, and other items for our stores. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected as a result of any event that has a material adverse effect on the vehicle manufacturers or component suppliers we represent. 

The manufacturers we represent may be adversely impacted by economic downturns, significant declines in the sales of their new vehicles, labor strikes or similar disruptions (including within their major suppliers), rising raw materials costs, rising employee benefit costs, adverse publicity that may reduce consumer demand for their products (including due to bankruptcy), product defects, vehicle recall campaigns, litigation, poor product mix or unappealing vehicle design, governmental laws and regulations, or other adverse events. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more of the manufacturers we represent are impacted by any of the foregoing adverse events. 

Actions taken in response to continued operational losses by manufacturers we represent, including bankruptcy or reorganizations, could have a material adverse effect on our sales volumes and profitability. In addition, such actions could lead to the impairment of one or more of our franchise rights, inventories, fixed assets and other related assets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Actions taken in response to continued operational losses by manufacturers we represent, including bankruptcy or reorganizations, could also eliminate or reduce such manufacturers indemnification obligations to our dealerships, which could increase our risk in products liability actions. 

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 

If state dealer laws are repealed or weakened, our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination, nonrenewal or renegotiation of their dealership agreements. 

We depend on our vehicle dealership agreements for a substantial portion of our revenues and profitability. State dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealership agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or nonrenewal. Vehicle manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state motor vehicle dealer laws. If motor vehicle dealer laws are repealed or amended in the states in which we operate dealerships, the manufacturers we represent may be able to terminate our vehicle dealership agreements without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of state dealer laws, or if such laws are weakened, we will be subject to higher risk of termination or nonrenewal of our vehicle dealership agreements. Termination or nonrenewal of our vehicle dealership agreements would have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues and profitability. 

Our dealerships are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations that may result in claims and liabilities, which could be material. 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the following: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks; the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, petroleum and other materials; and the investigation and remediation of contamination. As with commercial vehicle dealerships generally, and service, parts and collision center operations in particular, our business involves the generation, use, storage, handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous materials or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials. Any non-compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties and remediation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

We may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling, treatment, or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes. Applicable laws may make us responsible for liability relating to the investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination. In connection with our acquisitions, it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities, some of which may be material. In connection with dispositions of businesses, or dispositions previously made by companies we acquire, we may retain exposure for environmental costs and liabilities, some of which may be material.

Further, environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. For example, in August 2021, the President of the United States issued an executive order intended to increase fuel efficiency, further reduce GHG emissions and speed up the development of zero-emission vehicles. The executive order calls for the EPA and the Secretary of Transportation to adopt new rules and regulations for commercial vehicles starting as early as model year 2027. Similarly, in June 2020, the California Air Resources Board adopted a final rule that is intended to phase out the sale of diesel-powered commercial vehicles over time by requiring a certain percentage of each manufacturer s commercial vehicles sold within the state to be zero-emission vehicles, or near-zero emission vehicles, starting in model year 2024. In addition, in July 2020, a group of fifteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia entered into a joint memorandum of understanding that commits each of them to work together to advance and accelerate the market for electric Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles and two additional states have since signed. Six of the states that signed are states where we sell new commercial vehicles: California, Colorado, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia. The signatories to the memorandum all agreed on a goal of ensuring that 100 of new Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles are zero emission by 2050, with an interim target of 30 zero emission by 2030. Attaining these goals would likely require the adoption of new laws and regulations and we cannot predict at this time whether such laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our business. Compliance with current or amended, or new or more stringent, laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, such laws could affect demand for the products that we sell. 

Disruptions to our information technology systems and breaches in data or system security could adversely affect our business. 

We rely upon our information technology systems to manage all aspects of our business, including processing and recording sales to, and payments from, customers, managing inventory, communicating with manufacturers and vendors, processing employee payroll and benefits and financial reporting. Any inability to manage these systems, including with respect to matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees and customers. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to cyberattacks and other security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, human errors or other events, and such incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite our best efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. 

We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware, ransomware and computer virus attacks. We are continuously developing and enhancing our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. This continued development and enhancement requires us to expend significant additional resources. However, we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched. If any of these breaches of security occur, we will be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. 

Any cyberattack, security breach or other event resulting in the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of personal identifiable information of employees or customers, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business operations, sales, reputation with current and potential customers, associates or vendors and employees and result in litigation or regulatory actions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.

We are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and the liability associated with such claims may exceed the level of our insurance coverage. 

In the course of our business, we are exposed to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from: (i) our customers use of commercial vehicles that we sell, service, lease or rent; (ii) our customers purchase of other products that we design, manufacture, sell or install, such as commercial vehicle parts, custom vehicle modifications and CNG fuel systems; and (iii) injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents that our service or delivery personnel are involved in. In addition, we have employees who work remotely from time to time at certain customers locations that are considered inherently dangerous, such as oil or gas well drilling sites, commercial construction sites and manufacturing facilities. We could also be subject to potential litigation associated with compliance with various laws and governmental regulations at the federal, state or local levels, such as those relating to vehicle and highway safety, health and workplace safety, security and employment-related claims. 

We carry comprehensive liability insurance, subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions, at levels we believe are sufficient to mitigate existing and future claims. However, we may be exposed to claims for which coverage is not afforded or the damages exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or multiple claims causing us to incur significant out-of-pocket costs before reaching the deductible amount, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of such insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Although we have not experienced any material losses that were not covered by insurance, our existing or future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, we could experience higher costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In fact, due to the rising costs of premiums over the last couple of years, we have been increasing our use of self-insurance programs and increasing the amounts of our deductibles. 

We have operations in Canada. As a result, we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws. 

Our operations in Canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include: (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates; and (ii) the need to comply with Canadian laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations, applicable to our operations in Canada. Changes in such laws or regulations, or any material failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, could increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways. In addition, laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof can conflict among jurisdictions, and compliance in one jurisdiction could result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

We are controlled by one shareholder and his affiliate. 

Collectively, Mr. Rush and his affiliate own approximately 0.3 of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 47.3 of our issued and outstanding Class B common stock. Mr. Rush collectively controls approximately 41.8 of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding shares, which is substantially more than any other person or group. The interests of Mr. Rush may not be consistent with the interests of all shareholders. As a result of such ownership, Mr. Rush has the ability to exercise substantial control over the Company, including with respect to the election of directors, the determination of matters requiring shareholder approval and other matters pertaining to corporate governance. 

Our dealership agreements could discourage another company from acquiring us. 

Our dealership agreements with Peterbilt impose ownership requirements on certain officers of the Company. All of our dealership agreements include restrictions on the sale or transfer of the underlying franchises. These ownership requirements and restrictions may prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and, therefore, may adversely impact the value of our common stock. 

Additionally, Mr. Rush granted Peterbilt a right of first refusal to purchase his shares of common stock in the event that he desires to transfer in excess of 100,000 shares in any 12-month period to any person other than an immediate family member, an associate or another Dealer Principal. This right of first refusal, the number of shares owned by Mr. Rush and his affiliate, the requirement in our dealership agreements that the Dealer Principals retain a controlling interest in us and the restrictions on the sale or transfer of our franchises contained in our dealer agreements, combined with the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without further vote or action by the shareholders, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control without further action by our shareholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent or delay a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable.

Table of Contents 

Actions by our shareholders or prospective shareholders that would violate any of the above restrictions on our dealership agreements are generally outside of our control. If we are unable to renegotiate these restrictions, we may be forced to terminate or sell one or more of our dealerships, which could have a material adverse effect on us. These restrictions may also inhibit our ability to raise required capital or to issue our stock as consideration for future acquisitions. 

Our Class A common stock has limited voting power. 

Each share of Class A common stock ranks substantially equal to each share of Class B common stock with respect to receipt of any dividends or distributions declared on shares of common stock and the right to receive proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of us after payment of our indebtedness and liquidation preference payments to holders of any preferred shares. However, holders of Class A common stock have 1/20th of one vote per share on all matters requiring a shareholder vote, while holders of Class B common stock have one full vote per share. 

Our Class B common stock has a low average daily trading volume. As a result, sales of our Class B common stock could cause the market price of our Class B common stock to drop, and it may be difficult for a stockholder to liquidate its position in our Class B common stock quickly without adversely affecting the market price of such shares. 

The volume of trading in our Class B common stock varies greatly and may often be light. As of December 31, 2022, the three-month average daily trading volume of our Class B common stock was approximately 17,500 shares, with twenty-five days having a trading volume below 10,000 shares. If any large shareholder were to begin selling shares in the market, the added available supply of shares could cause the market price of our Class B common stock to drop. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a shareholder to sell a large number of shares of our Class B common stock in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our Class B common stock. 

If W.M. Rusty Rush were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure a personal loan obligation, such sales could cause our stock price to decline. 

Mr. Rush has pledged certain of his shares of Class A and Class B common stock as collateral in connection with a personal loan. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Rush could be forced by the lender to sell shares of his Class A and/or Class B common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline, particularly with respect to our Class B common stock, which typically has a low average daily trading volume, as noted above. 

We are not a party to Mr. Rush s loan, but we have entered into a right of first refusal agreement with Mr. Rush and the lender. The right of refusal agreement provides us with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the shares pledged as collateral in the event Mr. Rush is ever in default under the terms of his loan. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

None. 

Item 2. Properties 

Our corporate headquarters are located in New Braunfels, Texas. As of December 2022, we also own or lease numerous facilities used in our operations in the following locations: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Ontario, Canada. 

We lease a hangar in New Braunfels, Texas for our corporate aircraft. We also own and operate a guest ranch of approximately 10,500 acres near Cotulla, Texas, which is used for client development purposes.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the ordinary course of business. We maintain liability insurance, including product liability coverage, in amounts deemed adequate by management. However, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or claim for which indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, we believe that there are no pending claims or litigation, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable.

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market SM under the symbols RUSHA and RUSHB. During 2022, our Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends on all outstanding shares of common stock totaling 0.80 per share. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, there is no assurance as to the payment of future dividends because the declaration and payment of such dividends is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors and will depend on historic and projected earnings, capital requirements, covenant compliance, financial conditions and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. 

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our Class A common stock and Class B common stock for the fiscal periods indicated and as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market SM and dividends declared.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

We are a full-service, integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services. We operate one segment - the Truck Segment. The Truck Segment operates a network of commercial vehicle dealerships primarily under the name Rush Truck Centers. Most Rush Truck Centers are a franchised dealer for commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Ford, Isuzu, IC Bus or Blue Bird. Through our strategically located network of Rush Truck Centers, we provide one-stop service for the needs of our commercial vehicle customers. We offer an integrated approach to meeting customer needs by providing service, parts and collision repair (collectively, Aftermarket Products and Services in addition to new and used commercial vehicle sales and leasing, insurance and financial services, vehicle upfitting, CNG fuel systems and vehicle telematics products. 

Our goal is to continue to serve as the premier service solutions provider to the end-users of commercial vehicles. Our strategic efforts to achieve this goal include continuously expanding our portfolio of Aftermarket Products and Services, broadening the diversity of our commercial vehicle product offerings and extending our network of Rush Truck Centers. Our commitment to provide innovative solutions to service our customers needs continues to drive our strong Aftermarket Products and Services revenues. 

Our Aftermarket Products and Services include a wide range of capabilities and products such as providing parts, service and collision repairs at certain of our Rush Truck Centers, a fleet of mobile service units, technicians who work in our customers facilities, a proprietary line of commercial vehicle parts and accessories, vehicle upfitting, a broad range of diagnostic and analysis capabilities, a suite of telematics products and assembly services for specialized bodies and equipment. Aftermarket Products and Services accounted for 61.7 of our total gross profits in 2022. 

Stock Split 

On September 15, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a 3-for-2 stock split of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, which was effected in the form of a stock dividend. On October 12, 2020, we distributed one additional share of stock for every two shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and Class B common stock, par value 0.01 per share, held by shareholders of record as of September 28, 2020. All share and per share data in this Form 10-K have been adjusted and restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred on the first day of the earliest period presented. 

The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on Our Business 

While business conditions have improved significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, our industry continues to be impacted by supply chain issues generally believed to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic that are negatively affecting new commercial vehicle production and the availability of aftermarket parts.

Summary of 2022 

Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 are summarized below as follows: 

Our gross revenues totaled 7,101.7 million, a 38.5 increase from gross revenues of 5,126.1 million in 2021. 

Gross profit increased 394.9 million, or 36.1 , compared to 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 20.9 in 2022, from 21.3 in 2021. 

Our new Class 8 heavy-duty unit sales increased 51.8 , compared to 2021, which accounted for 6.3 of the total U.S. market and 1.8 of the total Canadian market. 

Our new Class 4-7 medium-duty unit sales increased 5.2 , compared to 2021, including buses, which accounted for 4.6 of the total U.S. market and 2.2 of the total Canadian market. 

New light-duty truck unit sales increased 18.4 in 2022, compared to 2021. 

Used truck unit sales decreased 6.0 , compared to 2021, however, used truck revenues increased 28.5 , compared to 2021 due to a sharp increase in used truck values in the first half of 2022. 

Aftermarket Products and Services revenues increased 579.1 million, or 32.3 , to 2,372.4 million, compared to 1,793.4 million in 2021. 

Lease and rental revenues increased 75.0 million, or 30.3 , to 322.3 million, compared to 2021. 

Selling, General and Administrative SG A expenses increased 196.5 million, or 26.9 , to 927.8 million, compared to 731.3 million in 2021. 

On May 2, 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 30 equity interest in RTC Canada, resulting in us now owning an 80 controlling interest in RTC Canada. 

All of the above increases in new commercial vehicle sales, lease and rental revenues and Aftermarket Products and Services revenues and SG A expense for 2022 are primarily due to the acquisition of Summit Truck Group, LLC in December 2021 and the inclusion of RTC Canada results of operations beginning in May 2022. 

2023 Outlook 

According to A.C.T. Research Co., LLC A.C.T. Research ), a commercial vehicle industry data and forecasting service provider, new U. S. Class 8 truck retail sales are estimated to total 255,155 truck units in 2023, a 7.8 decrease compared to 259,220 units sold in 2022. We expect our U.S. market share of new Class 8 truck sales to range between 6.0 and 6.5 in 2023. This market share percentage would result in the sale of approximately 15,300 to 16,500 new Class 8 trucks in 2023. We expect to sell approximately 1,000 additional new Class 8 trucks in Canada in 2023. 

According to A.C.T. Research, new U. S. Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle retail sales are estimated to total 253,600 units in 2023, an 8.5 increase compared to 233,679 units sold in 2022. We expect our U.S. market share of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales to range between 4.2 and 4.7 in 2023. This market share percentage would result in the sale of approximately 10,750 to 11,900 new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles in 2023. We expect to sell approximately 250 additional new Class 5 through 7 commercial vehicles in Canada in 2023. 

We expect to sell approximately 1,800 to 2,000 light-duty vehicles and approximately 7,000 to 7,200 used commercial vehicles in 2023. 

We expect lease and rental revenue to increase 9 to 11 during 2023, compared to 2022. This projected increase in lease and rental revenue in 2023, compared to 2022, is primarily related to a result of strong demand for rental commercial vehicles and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

35

Table of Contents 

We continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives to increase our Aftermarket Products and Services revenues. We believe our Aftermarket Products and Services revenues will increase 9 to 12 in 2023, compared to 2022. This projected increase in Aftermarket Products and Services revenues in 2023, compared to 2022, is primarily related to price increases by the manufacturers of parts we sell and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

The above projections for new commercial vehicle sales will depend on our ability to obtain commercial vehicles from the manufacturers we represent and such projections could be negatively impacted by manufacturer allocation decisions and supply chain issues affecting manufacturers production. In addition, we continue to monitor inflation and rising interest rates, which may negatively impact consumer spending and capital expenditures across a variety of industries we support. 

Key Performance Indicator 

Absorption Ratio. Management uses several performance metrics to evaluate the performance of our commercial vehicle dealerships and considers Rush Truck Centers absorption ratio to be of critical importance. Absorption ratio is calculated by dividing the gross profit from our Aftermarket Products and Services departments by the overhead expenses of all of a dealership s departments, except for the selling expenses of the new and used commercial vehicle departments and carrying costs of new and used commercial vehicle inventory. When 100 absorption is achieved, all of the gross profit from the sale of a commercial vehicle, after sales commissions and inventory carrying costs, directly impacts operating profit. Our commercial vehicle dealerships achieved a 136.6 absorption ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 129.8 absorption ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Inventory Reserves 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by specific identification of new and used commercial vehicle inventory and by the first-in, first-out method for tires, parts and accessories. As the market value of our inventory typically declines over time, reserves are established based on historical loss experience and market trends. These reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of our inventory on hand. An allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value. 

Purchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill 

Purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires the use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. We determine whether substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If not, we determine whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business. 

In connection with our business combinations, we record certain intangible assets, including franchise rights. We periodically review the estimated useful lives and fair values of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life. 

36

Table of Contents 

The excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. If impaired, the carrying values of the assets are written down to fair value using Level 3 inputs. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of Level 3 fair value. 

Accounting for Income Taxes 

Management s judgment is required to determine the provisions for income taxes and to determine whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. Accordingly, the facts and financial circumstances impacting deferred income tax assets are reviewed quarterly and management s judgment is applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required, if any, in any given period. 

Our income tax returns are periodically audited by tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. 

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. An unfavorable tax settlement would generally require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. Our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest.

Industry 

We operate in the commercial vehicle market. There has historically been a high correlation between new product sales in the commercial vehicle market and the rate of change in U.S. industrial production and the U.S. gross domestic product. 

Heavy-Duty Truck Market 

The U.S. retail heavy-duty truck market is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, fuel prices, other methods of transportation, environmental and other government regulation, interest rate fluctuations and customer business cycles. According to data published by A.C.T. Research, total U.S. retail sales of new Class 8 trucks in the last ten years have ranged from a low of approximately 187,600 in 2013 to a high of approximately 281,440 in 2019. Class 8 trucks are defined by the American Automobile Association as trucks with a minimum gross vehicle weight rating above 33,000 pounds. 

Typically, Class 8 trucks are assembled by manufacturers utilizing certain components that may be manufactured by other companies, including engines, transmissions, axles, wheels and other components. As commercial vehicles and certain commercial vehicle components have become increasingly complex, the ability to provide service for commercial vehicles has become an increasingly competitive factor in the industry. The ability to provide such service requires a significant capital investment in diagnostic and other equipment, parts inventory and highly trained service personnel. EPA and Department of Transportation regulatory guidelines for service processes, including collision center, paint work and waste disposal, require sophisticated equipment to ensure compliance with environmental and safety standards. Differentiation between commercial vehicle dealers has become less dependent on price competition and is increasingly based on a dealer s ability to offer a wide variety of services to their clients in a timely manner to minimize vehicle downtime. Such services include the following: efficient, conveniently located and easily accessible commercial vehicle service centers with an adequate supply of replacement parts and other aftermarket products and services; financing for commercial vehicle purchases; leasing and rental programs; and the ability to accept multiple unit trade-ins related to large fleet purchases. We believe our one-stop center concept and the size and geographic diversity of our dealership network gives us a competitive advantage in providing these services. 

A.C.T. Research currently estimates approximately 255,155 new Class 8 trucks will be sold in the United States in 2023, compared to approximately 259,220 new Class 8 trucks sold in 2022. A.C.T. Research currently forecasts sales of new Class 8 trucks in the U.S. to be approximately 212,000 in 2024. 

Medium-Duty Truck Market 

Many of our Rush Truck Centers sell medium-duty commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Ford or Isuzu, and provide parts and service for medium-duty commercial vehicles. Medium-duty commercial vehicles are principally used in short haul markets as delivery vehicles; they typically operate locally and generally do not leave their service areas overnight. We also sell light-duty vehicles (Class 3 and under) at several of our Ford dealerships. 

A.C.T. Research currently forecasts sales of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles in the U.S. to be approximately 253,600 units in 2023, compared to 233,679 units in 2022. A.C.T. Research currently forecasts sales of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles in the U.S. to be approximately 252,750 in 2024.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues 

Total revenues increased 1,975.6 million, or 38.5 , in 2022, compared to 2021. 

Our Aftermarket Products and Services revenues increased 579.1 million, or 32.3 , in 2022, compared to 2021. The increase in Aftermarket Parts and Services revenues was primarily a result of strong demand, inflation, the Summit acquisition and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

Our revenues from sales of new and used commercial vehicles increased 1,311.4 million, or 43.1 , in 2022, compared to 2021. The increase in commercial vehicle revenues was primarily a result of strong demand, the Summit acquisition and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

We sold 16,778 new heavy-duty trucks in 2022, a 51.8 increase compared to 11,052 new heavy-duty trucks in 2021. Our share of the new U.S. Class 8 commercial vehicle sales market increased to approximately 6.3 in 2022, from 4.9 in 2021. This increase in new Class 8 truck sales and market share was primarily a result of strong demand for new commercial vehicles, the Summit acquisition and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

We sold 11,025 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, including 1,237 buses, in 2022, a 5.2 increase compared to 10,485 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, including 959 buses, in 2021. In 2022, we achieved a 4.6 share of the Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle market in the U.S., compared to 4.2 in 2021. Our new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales increased due to strong demand for new commercial vehicles, the Summit acquisition and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

We sold 2,039 new light-duty vehicles in 2022, an 18.4 increase compared to 1,722 new light-duty vehicles in 2021. Our light-duty vehicle sales benefited from the increased demand for light-duty vehicles in the U.S. 

We sold 7,078 used commercial vehicles in 2022, a 6.0 decrease compared to 7,527 used commercial vehicles in 2021. We believe used commercial vehicle demand and values will continue to decrease as new commercial vehicle production increases to a level adequate to meet customer demand. 

Commercial vehicle lease and rental revenues increased 75.0 million, or 30.3 , in 2022, compared to 2021. This increase in commercial vehicle lease and rental revenues was primarily a result of strong demand for rental commercial vehicles, the Summit acquisition and the consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. 

Finance and insurance revenues increased 1.8 million, or 6.4 , in 2022, compared to 2021. Finance and insurance revenues have limited direct costs and, therefore, contribute a disproportionate share of our operating profits. We expect finance and insurance revenues to fluctuate proportionately with our new and used commercial vehicle sales in 2023. 

Other revenues increased 8.2 million, or 46.7 in 2022, compared to 2021. Other revenues consist primarily of document fees related to commercial vehicle sales. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit increased 394.9 million, or 36.1 , in 2022, compared to 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 20.9 in 2022, from 21.3 in 2021. This decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was a result of a change in our product sales mix. Commercial vehicle sales, a lower margin revenue item, increased as a percentage of total revenues to 61.3 in 2022, from 59.3 in 2021. Aftermarket Services revenues, a higher margin revenue item, decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 33.4 in 2022, from 35.0 in 2021.

Table of Contents 

Gross margins from our Aftermarket Products and Services operations increased to 38.6 in 2022, from 38.1 in 2021. This increase in gross margins was primarily due to increases in parts pricing, increases in parts rebates from our parts suppliers. Gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services increased to 916.8 million in 2022, from 684.1 million in 2021. Historically, parts operations gross margins range from 28 to 30 and service and collision center operations range from 66 to 68 . Gross profits from parts sales represented 62.8 of total gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services operations in 2022 and 61.4 in 2021. Service and collision center operations represented 37.2 of total gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services operations in 2022 and 38.6 2021. We expect blended gross margins on Aftermarket Products and Services operations to range from 37.5 to 38.5 in 2023. 

Gross margins on new Class 8 truck sales increased to 9.9 in 2022, from 9.0 in 2021. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for new Class 8 trucks and the mix of purchasers during 2022. In 2023, we expect overall gross margins from new heavy-duty truck sales of approximately 8.8 to 9.9 . 

Gross margins on new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales increased to 8.1 in 2022, from 7.8 in 2021. This increase was primarily due to the mix of purchasers during 2022. For 2023, we expect overall gross margins from new medium-duty commercial vehicle sales of approximately 7.5 to 8.5 , but this will largely depend upon the mix of purchasers and types of vehicles sold. 

Gross margins on used commercial vehicle sales decreased to 9.9 in 2022, from 18.7 in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to declining used commercial vehicle values as new Class 8 vehicle production increased during 2022. This margins in 2021 were primarily a result of the increase in used commercial vehicle values due to strong demand for used commercial vehicles due to production constraints experienced by manufacturers we represent. We expect margins on used commercial vehicles to return to our historical range of between 8.0 and 10.0 in 2023. 

Gross margins from commercial vehicle lease and rental sales increased to 31.2 in 2022, from 23.9 in 2021. This increase is primarily related to increased rental fleet utilization and changes initially made in the fall of 2021 with respect to how we finance commercial vehicles for our lease and rental fleet. The interest associated with the WF Credit Agreement, the PLC Agreement and the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement is recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to these credit agreements, interest expense associated with our lease and rental fleet purchases was recorded in cost of sales because each borrowing was directly related to each lease and rental vehicle purchased. This change in the structure of financing of our lease and rental fleet results in increased gross margins from our commercial vehicle lease and rental sales. We expect gross margins from lease and rental sales of approximately 28.0 to 31.0 during 2023. Our policy is to depreciate our lease and rental fleet using a straight-line method over each customer s contractual lease term. The lease unit is depreciated to a residual value that approximates fair value at the expiration of the lease term. This policy results in us realizing reasonable gross margins while the unit is in service and a corresponding gain or loss on sale when the unit is sold at the end of the lease term. 

Finance and insurance revenues and other revenues, as described above, have limited direct costs and, therefore, contribute a disproportionate share of gross profit. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A expenses increased 196.5 million, or 26.9 , in 2022, compared to 2021. This increase primarily resulted from increased general and administrative expense associated with the Summit acquisition and consolidation of RTC Canada into our operating results. SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 13.1 in 2022, from 14.3 in 2021. Annual SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues have ranged from approximately 12.4 to 14.3 over the last five years. In general, when new and used commercial vehicle revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues, SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues will be at the lower end of this range. For 2023, we expect SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues to range from 13.0 to 14.0 . For 2023, we expect the selling portion of SG A expenses to be approximately 25.0 to 30.0 of new and used commercial vehicle gross profit. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 2.3 million, or 4.3 , in 2022, compared to 2021.

Table of Contents 

Interest Expense, Net 

Net interest expense increased 17.4 million, or 980.5 , in 2022, compared to 2021. This increase in interest expense is a result of the increase in inventory levels and rising interest rates on our variable rate debt compared to 2021. We expect net interest expense in 2023 to increase due to interest related to lease and rental borrowings and floor plan debt, but the amount of the increase will depend on inventory levels, interest rate fluctuations and the amount of cash available to make prepayments on our floor plan arrangements. 

Income before Income Taxes 

Income before income taxes increased 195.6 million, or 62.4 , in 2022, compared to 2021, as a result of the factors described above. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense increased 45.0 million, or 62.2 , in 2022, compared to 2021, as a result of the factors described above. We provided for taxes at a 23.0 effective rate in 2022 and 2021. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23.0 to 24.0 of pretax income in 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our short-term cash requirements are primarily for working capital, inventory financing, the renovation and expansion of existing facilities and the construction or purchase of new facilities. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through the retention of profits, borrowings under our floor plan arrangements and bank financings. As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of approximately 439.1 million, including 201.0 million in cash, available to fund our operations. We believe that these funds, together with expected cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. From time to time, we utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under our various credit agreements. The resulting interest earned on the Floor Plan Credit Agreement is recognized as an offset to our interest expense. 

We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon: (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand; (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations; (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our secured line of credit, working capital lines of credit available under certain of our credit agreements and our Floor Plan Credit Agreement; and (iv) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, equity repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, commitments and contingencies, debt repayments, acquisitions, capital expenditures and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

We have a line of credit that provides for a maximum borrowing of 20.0 million. There were no advances outstanding under this secured line of credit at December 31, 2022, however, 14.1 million was pledged to secure various letters of credit related to self-insurance products, leaving 5.9 million available for future borrowings as of December 31, 2022. 

Our long-term debt, floor plan financing agreements and the WF Credit Agreement require us to satisfy various financial ratios such as the leverage ratio, the asset coverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to debt secured by lease and rental units, our floor plan credit agreements and the WF Credit Agreement. We do not anticipate any breach of the covenants in the foreseeable future. 

We expect to purchase or lease commercial vehicles worth approximately 170.0 million to 180.0 million for our leasing operations during 2023, depending on customer demand, most of which will be financed. We also expect to make capital expenditures for the purchase of recurring items such as computers, shop tools and equipment and company vehicles of approximately 35.0 million to 40.0 million during 2023. 

We are currently under contract to construct a new facility in Pontoon Beach, Illinois at an estimated cost of 13.9 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we paid a cash dividend of 11.4 million. Additionally, on February 14, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.21 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, to be paid on March 16, 2023, to all shareholders of record as of February 27, 2023. The total dividend disbursement is estimated to be approximately 11.4 million. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, there is no assurance as to future dividends because the declaration and payment of such dividends is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors and will depend on historic and projected earnings, capital requirements, covenant compliance and financial conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant. 

On December 2, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing management to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of 150.0 million of our shares of Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock. In connection with the adoption of the new stock repurchase plan, we terminated the prior stock repurchase plan, which was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. Repurchases, if any, will be made at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate and may be made through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The actual timing, number and value of repurchases under the stock repurchase program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, stock price and other factors, including those related to the ownership requirements of our dealership agreements with Peterbilt. As of December 31, 2022, we had repurchased 5.8 million of our shares of common stock under the current stock repurchase program. The current stock repurchase program expires on December 31, 2023, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 

We anticipate funding the capital expenditures for the improvement and expansion of existing facilities and recurring expenses through our operating cash flows. We have the ability to fund the construction or purchase of new facilities through our operating cash flows or by financing. 

We have no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2022. However, we will continue to purchase vehicles for our lease and rental operations and authorize capital expenditures for the improvement or expansion of our existing dealership facilities and construction or purchase of new facilities based on market opportunities.

Cash flows used in financing activities include borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and net payments of floor plan notes payable. During 2022, our financing activities resulted in net cash used in financing of 0.7 million. The cash outflows consisted primarily of 1,099.2 million used for principal repayments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations during 2022 and 8.7 million for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. Additionally, during 2022, we paid cash dividends of 44.6 million and used 93.7 million to repurchase shares of Rush Class A common stock and Rush Class B common stock. These cash outflows were partially offset by 273.9 million from net draws on floor plan notes payable (non-trade), borrowings of 958.3 million of long-term debt and 13.3 million from the issuance of shares related to equity compensation plans.

On September 14, 2021, we entered into the WF Credit Agreement with the WF Lenders and the WF Agent which was amended effective November 30, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement, the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to 175.0 million of revolving credit loans for certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for our Idealease leasing and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. We expect to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for our Idealease lease and rental fleet. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the WF Credit Agreement from time to time until the maturity date. Borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on each interest payment date, as defined in the WF Credit Agreement, at (A) the daily SOFR plus (i) 1.25 or (ii) 1.5 , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or (B) on or after the term SOFR transition date, the term SOFR plus (i) 1.25 or (ii) 1.5 , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The WF Credit Agreement expires on September 14, 2024, although, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the WF Agent has the right to, or upon the request of the required lenders must, terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding principal and interest due and payable. We may terminate the commitments at any time. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 40.5 million outstanding under the WF Credit Agreement.

On October 1, 2021, we entered into the PLC Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the PLC Agreement, PLC agreed to make up to 300.0 million of revolving credit loans to finance certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through our PacLease franchises. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the PLC Agreement from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the borrowing base. Advances under the PLC Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at our option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus 1.55 , provided that the floating rate of interest is subject to a floor of 0 , or (B) a fixed rate, to be determined between us and PLC in each instance of borrowing at a fixed rate. The PLC Agreement expires on October 1, 2025, although either party has the right to terminate the PLC Agreement at any time upon 180 days written notice. If we terminate the PLC Agreement prior to October 1, 2025, then all payments will be deemed to be voluntary prepayments subject to a potential prepayment premium. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 185.0 million outstanding under the PLC Agreement. 

Most of our commercial vehicle purchases are made on terms requiring payment to the manufacturer within 15 days or less from the date the commercial vehicles are invoiced from the factory. On September 14, 2021, we entered into Floor Plan Credit Agreement with BMO Harris and the lenders signatory thereto. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement includes an aggregate loan commitment of 1.0 billion. Borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to (A) the greater of (i) zero and (ii) one month LIBOR rate, determined on the last day of the prior month, plus (B) 1.10 and are payable monthly. Loans under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement for the purchase of used inventory are limited to 150.0 million and loans for working capital purposes are limited to 200.0 million. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026, although BMO Harris has the right to terminate at any time upon 360 days written notice and we may terminate at any time, subject to specified limited exceptions. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 762.9 million outstanding under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. The average daily outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement were 638.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. We utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross interest expense under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. 

On May 31, 2022, RTC Canada entered into the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement with BMO. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to 120.0 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance certain of RTC Canada s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through RTC Canada s Idealease franchise, with an additional 20.0 million available upon the request of RTC Canada and consent of BMO. Advances under the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the first business day of each calendar month, at CDOR, plus 1.35 .

On July 15, 2022, RTC Canada entered into the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement with BMO. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to 116.7 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance RTC Canada s purchase of new and used vehicle inventory. Loans to purchase used vehicle inventory are limited to twenty percent (20 of the credit limit available at such time. RTC Canada may borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the credit limits set forth above with respect to new and used vehicles. Advances under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the first business day of each calendar month, at CDOR, plus 0.90 and in the case of an advance required to be made in USD dollars, at LIBOR, plus 1.10 . The RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement expires September 14, 2026. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 44.6 million outstanding under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement. 

Navistar Financial Corporation and Peterbilt offer trade terms that provide an interest-free inventory stocking period for certain new commercial vehicles. This interest-free period is generally 15 to 60 days. If the commercial vehicle is not sold within the interest-free period, we then finance the commercial vehicle under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. 

Cyclicality 

Our business is dependent on a number of factors including general economic conditions, fuel prices, interest rate fluctuations, credit availability, environmental and other government regulations and customer business cycles. Unit sales of new commercial vehicles have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on these general economic conditions. According to data published by A.C.T. Research, total U.S. retail sales of new Class 8 commercial vehicles have ranged from a low of approximately 187,600 in 2013, to a high of approximately 281,440 in 2019. Through geographic expansion, concentration on higher margin Aftermarket Products and Services and diversification of our customer base, we have attempted to reduce the negative impact of adverse general economic conditions or cyclical trends affecting the Class 8 commercial vehicle industry on our earnings.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices, including interest rate risk, and other relevant market rate or price risks. 

We are exposed to market risk through interest rates related to our floor plan financing agreements, the WF Credit Agreement, the PLC Agreement, the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement and discount rates related to finance sales. Our floor plan debt is based on LIBOR and CDOR, the WF Credit Agreement is based on SOFR, the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement is based on CDOR and the PLC Agreement is based on the prime rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding floor plan borrowings and lease and rental fleet borrowings in the aggregate amount of 1,208.6 million. Assuming an increase or decrease in LIBOR, SOFR, CDOR or the prime rate of 100 basis points, annual interest expense could correspondingly increase or decrease by approximately 12.1 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. 

Used Commercial Vehicle Inventory Reserves 

Description of the Matter 

At December 31, 2022, the Company s used commercial vehicle inventory balance is approximately 80 million, which is net of management s estimate of used commercial vehicle inventory reserves in the amount of approximately 7 million. As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, management adjusts the value of its inventory to net realizable value to the extent it determines inventory cost cannot be recovered. Management estimates future demand and sales prices to calculate the used commercial vehicle inventory reserves and to make corresponding adjustments to the carrying value of these inventories to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value. 

48

Table of Contents 

Auditing management s estimate of the used commercial vehicle inventory reserves involved auditor subjective judgment because the estimate is sensitive to changes in management s assumptions for forecasted product demand and future sales prices. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s processes to estimate the used commercial vehicle inventory reserve, which included management s review of the underlying significant assumptions. 

Our substantive audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions described above, and we tested the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimation calculations and evaluating significant assumptions. We also compared the cost of on-hand used commercial vehicle inventories to customer demand forecasts and historical sales. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the used commercial vehicle inventory reserves that would result from changes in the assumptions.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2002.

COVID-19 Risks and Uncertainties 

While business conditions have improved significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, our industry continues to be impacted by supply chain issues generally attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic that are negatively affecting new commercial vehicle production and the availability of aftermarket parts. The Company is unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its future business and operating results due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on global economic trends and the various supply chains serving the commercial vehicle industry. 

Foreign Currency Transactions 

The functional currency of the Company s foreign subsidiary, Rush Truck Centres of Canada Limited RTC Canada ), is the local currency. Results of operations for RTC Canada are translated to USD using the average exchange rate on a monthly basis during each quarter.

million as of December 31, 2022 and million as of December 31, 2021, and is included in Other Assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life, as there are no economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing manufacturer franchise rights have expiration dates, the Company expects that it will be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the Company does not amortize manufacturer franchise rights.

Primary Lenders 

The Company purchases its new and used commercial vehicle inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs as described in Note 7 to these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company finances the majority of all new commercial vehicle inventory and the loan value of its used commercial vehicle inventory under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement with BMO Harris. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement includes an aggregate loan commitment of billion. The Company s floor plan financing agreements provide that the occurrence of certain events will be considered events of default. In the event that the Company s floor plan financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship with any of its current primary lenders terminates, the Company would need to obtain similar financing from other sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or alternative financing if necessary. 

From time to time, the Company uses the WF Credit Agreement to finance its Idealease lease and rental fleet vehicles and for other working capital needs Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement, the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to million of revolving credit loans for certain of the Company s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for the Company s Idealease lease and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. The Company expects to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for the Company s Idealease lease and rental fleet. 

The Company uses the PLC Agreement to finance its PacLease lease and rental fleet vehicles. Pursuant to the terms of the PLC Agreement, PLC agreed to make up to million of revolving credit loans to finance commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through the Company s PacLease franchises. 

RTC Canada uses the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement to finance its Idealease lease and rental fleet vehicles. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance certain of RTC Canada s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through RTC Canada s Idealease franchise, with an additional million available upon the request of RTC Canada and consent of BMO. 

RTC Canada uses the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement to finance its new and used vehicle inventory. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance RTC Canada s purchase of new and used vehicle inventory. 

Concentrations of Credit Risks 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers to be quality financial institutions based on periodic assessments of such institutions. The Company s cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. 

The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by selling a majority of its trade receivables, other than vehicle accounts receivable, without recourse. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are reduced because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company s customer base; however, substantially all of the Company s business is concentrated in the United States commercial vehicle markets and related aftermarkets. 

The Company generally sells finance contracts it enters into with customers to finance the purchase of commercial vehicles to third parties. These finance contracts are sold by the Company both with and without recourse. A majority of the Company s finance contracts are sold without recourse. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and a reserve for repossession losses related to finance contracts sold with recourse. Historically, the Company s allowances and reserves have covered losses inherent in these receivables.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. Under Accounting Standards Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, the Company is required to remeasure expected credit losses for financial instruments held on the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts. 

Accounts receivable consists primarily of commercial vehicle sales receivables, manufacturers receivables and leasing, parts and service sales receivables and other trade receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based on the probability of default, its historical rate of losses, aging and current economic conditions. The Company writes off account balances when it has exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. These write-offs are charged against the allowance for credit losses. 

Inventory 

The Company provides a reserve for obsolete and slow moving parts. The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis. The Company relies on historical information to support its reserve. Once the inventory is written down, the Company does not reverse any reserve balance until the inventory is sold. 

The valuation for new and used commercial vehicle inventory is based on specific identification. A detail of new and used commercial vehicle inventory is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments to the value of specific vehicles are made on a quarterly basis.

billion and has the interest rate benchmarked to LIBOR, as defined in the agreement. The interest rate under the Company s Floor Plan Credit Agreement is the one month LIBOR rate plus . The effective interest rate applicable to the Company s Floor Plan Credit Agreement was approximately as of December 31, 2022. The Company utilizes its excess cash on hand to pay down its outstanding borrowings under its Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to the Company s gross interest expense under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. 

The Company s RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement provides for a loan commitment of up to million CAD and has the interest benchmarked to CDOR, as defined in the agreement. Loans to purchase used vehicle inventory are limited to twenty percent 20 of the credit limit available at such time. RTC Canada may borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the credit limits set forth above with respect to new and used vehicles. Advances under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the first business day of each calendar month, at CDOR, plus and in the case of an advance required to be made in USD dollars, at LIBOR, plus . 

The Company finances substantially all of the purchase price of its new commercial vehicle inventory and the loan value of its used commercial vehicle inventory under its Floor Plan Credit Agreement and RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement, under which BMO Harris and BMO pay the manufacturer directly with respect to new commercial vehicles. Amounts borrowed under the Company s Floor Plan Credit Agreement and RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement are due when the related commercial vehicle inventory (collateral) is sold. The Company s Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026, although BMO Harris has the right to terminate the Floor Plan Credit Agreement at any time upon 360 days written notice and the Company may terminate at any time, subject to specified limited exceptions. On December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately million outstanding under its Floor Plan Credit Agreement. The Company s RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement expires September 14, 2026.

A lease is classified as a finance lease if any of the following conditions exist on the date of lease commencement: 

The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term. 

The lease provides the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset, and that option is reasonably certain to be exercised. 

The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. 

The present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. 

The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications. 

The lessor expects to have no alternative use for the leased asset at the end of the lease. 

The Company adopted Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, and applied the practical expedients permitted, which among other things, allowed it to retain its existing assessment of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease and whether such lease is classified as an operating or finance lease. The Company made an accounting policy election that keeps leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off of the balance sheet and results in recognizing those lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The Company leases commercial vehicles and real estate under finance and operating leases. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at its inception. For leases with terms greater than twelve months, the Company records the related asset and obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term. Many of the Company s leases include renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into its determination of lease payments when appropriate. The Company has elected not to account for lease and nonlease components as a single combined lease component as lessee. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of its leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company must estimate its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. 

Lease of Vehicles as Lessee 

The Company leases commercial vehicles as the lessee under finance leases and operating leases. The lease terms vary from one year to ten years. Commercial vehicle finance leases have always been reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while operating leases were added to the Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2019 with the adoption of Topic 842. These vehicles are then subleased or rented by the Company to customers under various agreements. The Company received sublease income under non-cancelable subleases of million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The Company usually guarantees the residual value of vehicles under operating lease and finance lease arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company guaranteed commercial vehicle residual values of approximately million under operating lease and finance lease arrangements. 

Lease of Facilities as Lessee 

The Company s facility leases are classified as operating and finance leases and primarily reflect its use of dealership facilities and office space. The lease terms vary from one year to years, some of which include options to extend the lease term, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. The Company considers these options in determining the lease term used to establish its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. 

The Company leases facilities in Ontario, Canada from entities owned by the noncontrolling interest holder of RTC Canada. In 2022, the Company recorded approximately million in operating lease expense related to these leases.

Lease of Vehicles as Lessor 

The Company leases commercial vehicles that the Company owns to customers primarily over periods of one to ten years. The Company applied the practical expedient permitted within Topic 842 that allows it not to separate lease and nonlease components. Nonlease components typically consist of maintenance and licensing for the commercial vehicle. The variable nonlease components are generally based on mileage. Some leases contain an option for the lessee to purchase the commercial vehicle. 

The Company s policy is to depreciate its lease and rental fleet using a straight-line method over each customer s contractual lease term. The lease unit is depreciated to a residual value that approximates fair value at the expiration of the lease term. This policy results in the Company realizing reasonable gross margins while the unit is in service and a corresponding gain or loss on sale when the unit is sold at the end of the lease term. 

Sales-type leases are recognized by the Company as lease receivables. The lessee obtains control of the underlying asset and the Company recognizes sales revenue upon lease commencement. The receivable for sales-type leases as of December 31, 2022 in the amount of million is reflected in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Employee Incentive Plans 

In May 2007, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2007 Incentive Plan ). The 2007 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options (which may be nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options for tax purposes), stock appreciation rights issued independent of or in tandem with such options SARs ), restricted stock awards and performance awards. The 2007 Incentive Plan was amended and restated on May 20, 2014, May 16, 2017 and again on May 12, 2020, to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan to shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock and to make certain other changes intended to bring the 2007 Incentive Plan into conformance with current best practices. 

The aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options or SARs that may be granted to any one participant in any year under the 2007 Incentive Plan is shares of Class A common stock or shares of Class B common stock.

Since RTC Canada is a private company, the fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement . The fair value estimates are based on: (i) a discount rate of ; (ii) a terminal value based on a long-term sustainable growth rate of 3 ; (iii) financial multiples of companies in the same industry as RTC Canada; and (iv) adjustments because of the lack of control or lack of marketability that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in RTC Canada.

The Company retains inventory risk, determines the selling price to the customer and delivers the commercial vehicle to the customer. The Company generally pays a commission to internal sales representatives for the sale of a commercial vehicle. The Company will continue to expense the commission and recognize it concurrently with the respective commercial vehicle sale revenue upon delivery of the commercial vehicle to a customer. 

Revenue from the sale of parts is recognized when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer and consideration has been received in the form of cash or a receivable from the customer. The Company provides its customers the right to return certain eligible parts, estimates the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience and records an allowance for estimated returns, which has historically not been material. 

Revenue from the sale of commercial vehicle repair service is recognized when the service performed by the Company on a customer s vehicle is complete and the customer accepts the repair. Because the Company does not have an enforceable right to payment while the repair is being performed, revenue is recognized when the repair is complete. After a customer s acceptance, the Company has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and consideration has been received in the form of cash or a receivable from the customer. 

Any remaining performance obligations represent service orders for which work has not been completed. The Company s service contracts are predominantly short-term in nature with a contract term of one month or less. For those contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in Topic 606 exempting the Company from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. 

The Company receives commissions from third-party lenders for arranging customer financing for the purchase of commercial vehicles. The receipt of such commissions is deemed to be a single performance obligation that is satisfied when a financing agreement is executed and accepted by the financing provider. Once the contract has been accepted by the financing provider, the Company s performance obligation has been satisfied and the Company generally has no further obligations under the contract. The Company is the agent in this transaction, as it does not have control over the acceptance of the customer s financing arrangement by the financing provider. Consideration paid to the Company by the financing provider is based on the agreement between the Company and the financing provider. 

The Company receives commissions from third-party insurance companies for arranging insurance coverage for customers. The receipt of such commissions is deemed to be a single performance obligation that is satisfied when the insurance coverage is bound. The Company has no further obligations under the contract. The Company is the agent in this transaction because it does not have control over the insurance coverage provided by the insurance carrier. Consideration paid to the Company by the insurance provider is based on the agreement between the Company and the insurance provider. 

The Company records revenues from finance and insurance products at the net commission amount, which includes estimates of chargebacks that can occur if the underlying contract is not fulfilled. Chargeback amounts for commissions from financing companies are estimated assuming financing contracts are terminated before the customer has made six monthly payments. Chargeback amounts for commissions from insurance companies are estimated assuming insurance contracts are terminated before the underlying insurance contractual term has expired. Chargeback reserve amounts are based on historical chargebacks and have historically been immaterial. The Company does not have any right to retrospective commissions based on future profitability of finance and insurance contracts arranged. 

Other revenue consists mostly of documentation fees that are charged to customers in connection with the sale of a commercial vehicle and recognized as other revenue when a truck is sold. The Company recognizes the documentation fees at the point in time when the commercial vehicle is delivered to the customer.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). 

Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises, Inc. 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
