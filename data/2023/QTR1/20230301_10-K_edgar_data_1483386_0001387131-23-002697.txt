The
purpose of the abrdn Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust (known as Aberdeen Standard Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust prior
to March 31, 2022) (the Trust is to own, in an agreed proportion, gold, silver, platinum and palladium (collectively,
 Bullion transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust Shares ). Each Share
represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist solely
of Bullion. The Trust was formed on October 18, 2010 when an initial deposit of Bullion was made in exchange for the
issuance of two Baskets (a Basket consists of 50,000 Shares). 

The
sponsor of the Trust is abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC (known as Aberdeen Standard ETFs Sponsor LLC prior to March 1, 2022) (the Sponsor ).
The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee and the custodian is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.,
London Branch (the Custodian ). 

The
Trust s Shares at redeemable value increased from 970,513,038 at December 31, 2021 to 1,007,501,383 at December 31, 2022,
the Trust s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares in the Trust increased from 10,900,000 Shares at December 31, 2021 to 11,350,000
Shares at December 31, 2022. 

The
Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust has no directors, officers or employees. It
does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to improve the losses caused by changes in the price of gold,
silver, platinum and palladium. The Bullion held by the Trust will only be delivered to pay the remuneration due to the Sponsor
(the Sponsor s Fee ), distributed to Authorized Participants (defined below) in connection with the redemption
of Baskets or sold (1) on an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, (2) in the event the Trust terminates
and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 

The
Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under
such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodities futures contracts, commodity interests or
any other instruments regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ), as administered by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (the CFTC and the National Futures Association NFA ). The Trust is not a commodity
pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not commodity interests, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee
is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. The Trust
has no fixed termination date. 

The
Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.abrdn.com/us/etf through which the registrant s annual reports
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably
practicable after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional
information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 

Trust
Objective 

The
investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical gold, silver, platinum
and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses. The Trust holds Bullion in a ratio such that,
for every 0.03 ounces of gold, it holds 1.1 ounces of silver, 0.004 ounces of platinum and 0.006 ounces of palladium The Shares
are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in physical Bullion.
An investment in physical Bullion requires expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the assay,
transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense and complications have resulted in investments
in physical Bullion being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many investors. 

3 

The
Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with minimal credit
risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding physical Bullion. The Shares offer an investment that: 

Easily
Accessible and Relatively Cost Effective . Investors can access the gold, silver, platinum, and palladium markets through
a traditional brokerage account. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and
tactical asset allocation strategies that use Bullion by using the Shares instead of using the traditional means of purchasing,
trading and holding Bullion and for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than those associated
with the purchase, storage and insurance of physical Bullion. 

Exchange
Traded and Transparent. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca, providing investors with an efficient means to implement various
investment strategies. The Shares are eligible for margin accounts and are backed by the assets of the Trust and the Trust does
not hold or employ any derivative securities. Furthermore, the value of the Trust s holdings are reported on the Trust s
website daily. 

Minimal Credit Risk . The Shares represent an interest in physical bullion owned by the Trust (other than an amount
held in unallocated form which is not sufficient to make up a whole bar or plate or ingot of which is held temporarily to
effect a creation or redemption of Shares). Physical bullion of the Trust in the Custodian s possession is not subject
to borrowing arrangements with third parties. Other than the Bullion temporarily being held in an unallocated Bullion
account with the Custodian, the physical bullion of the Trust is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. See Risk
Factors Bullion held in the Trust s unallocated Bullion account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated Bullion
account is not segregated from the Custodian s assets... This contrasts with most other financial products that
gain exposure to bullion through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks. 

Investing
in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. See Risk Factors. 

Overview
of the Bullion Industry 

Introduction 

This
section provides a brief introduction to the Bullion industries by looking at some of the key participants, detailing the primary
sources of demand and supply and, with respect to the gold and silver industries, outlining the role of the official 
sector (i.e., central banks) in the markets. 

In
this annual report, the term ounces refers to fine troy ounces (with respect to gold only) and troy ounces (with
respect to silver, platinum and palladium). 

The
Gold Industry 

Market
Participants 

The
participants in the world gold market may be classified in the following sectors: the mining and producer sector, the banking
sector, the official sector, the investment sector, and the manufacturing sector. A brief description of each follows. 

Mining
and Producer Sector 

This
group includes mining companies that specialize in gold and silver production, mining companies that produce gold as a by-product
of other production (such as a copper or silver producer), scrap merchants and recyclers. 

4 

Banking
Sector 

Gold
bullion banks provide a variety of services to the gold market and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between
other parties. Services provided by the gold bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing,
physical gold purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers, and gold
deposit and loan instruments. 

The
Official Sector 

The official sector encompasses the activities of the various central banking operations of gold-holding
countries. From 2009 to 2019, the European Central Bank and other central banks of Europe operated under a series of four Central
Bank Gold Agreements CBGA ). The CBGA limited the amount of gold that these banks were allowed to sell for the duration
of each agreement, helping to stabilize the gold market. The CBGA had the desired effect, and the gold market has become more balanced,
eliminating the need for a formal agreement going forward. According to statistics provided by the World Gold Council, as of Q4
2022, central banks are estimated to hold approximately 35,715 tonnes tonne refers to one metric tonne, which is
equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or 32,151 troy ounces) of gold reserves, or approximately 17 of existing above-ground stocks. 

The
Investment Sector 

This
sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional and private investors and speculators. These participants
range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges, and retail-level coin collectors. 

The
Manufacturing Sector 

The
fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of gold for whom gold is a daily part
of their business. The jewelry industry is a large user of gold. Other industrial users of gold include the electronics and dental
industries.

Source:
World Gold Council Gold Survey 2022 (Metals Focus, Refinitiv GFMS, ICE Benchmark Administration, World Gold Council) 

 This
number captures demand in the OTC market (for which data is not readily available), changes to inventories on commodity exchanges,
any unobserved changes in fabrication inventories and any statistical residual. It is the difference between total supply and
gold demand. 

The
following are some of the main characteristics of the gold market illustrated by the table: 

One
factor which separates gold from other precious metals is that there are large above-ground stocks which can be quickly mobilized.
As a result of gold s liquidity, gold often acts more like a currency than a commodity. 

Over
the past ten years, (new) mine production of gold has experienced a modest rise of an average of 2.3 per annum. Of the three
sources of supply, mine production accounts for 76.3 in 2021. Recycled gold volumes have ranged from 1,067 tonnes to 1,637 tonnes
over the past 10 years. 

On
the demand side, jewelry is clearly the greatest source of demand. Industrial demand has fluctuated between 7.4 and 8.3 of
total demand over the past 10 years. Exchange traded product inventory build had seen strong growth through 2012, followed by
outflows in 2013, 2014 and 2015 as the price of gold fell by a cumulative 30 between 2013 and 2015. Exchange traded product inventory
build has been positive each year from 2016 to 2020, but fell off in 2021. During the 2013 price crash, retail coin and bar demand rose to a 10-year
high as retail investors, especially from China, were enticed by the falling prices. Retail coin and bar demand tapered off in 2019, but picked back up in 2020 and 2021. Investor inflows into ETFs returned in 2019 and 2020 amid heightened market uncertainty but saw 189 tonnes of outflows in 2021.

Historical
Chart of the Price of Gold 

The
price of gold is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements
in the price of gold in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors,
including announcements from central banks regarding a country s reserve gold holdings, agreements among central banks,
political uncertainties around the world, and economic concerns.

following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of gold in U.S. Dollars from December 31, 2021 to December
31, 2022.

The price of gold tends to rise during periods of low real interest rates and high monetary expansion,
as they are often associated with currency debasement and systemic financial failures. The price of gold peaked at 1,943.20 per
ounce in January 2021 as the uncertainties regarding the pandemic drove prices higher. 2021 proved to be a volatile year for gold
as major market events and continued pandemic uncertainty, coupled with new variants, allowed gold to remain in the investment
picture during the year. Additionally, the trends of 3 years of investor outflows in global ETFs and net negative investor sentiment
in gold futures positioning reversed in 2016 and continued through 2021. Continued low real interest rates, tepid economic growth,
and concerns regarding the recovery of the pandemic were key tailwinds for gold that sparked a return of investor interest. 2022
proved to be another volatile year for gold as the price climbed as high as 2,039.05 per ounce in the weeks following Russia s
invasion of Ukraine. Aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve coupled and a strengthening of the US Dollar saw
ETF holders liquidate as the price of gold dropped as low as 1,628.75 per ounce on November 3, 2022. However, increased demand
from central banks, along with the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, sparked a Q4 rally that saw the price of gold climb to 1,813.75
per ounce to close the year. 

The
Silver Industry 

Market
Participants 

The
participants in the world silver market may be classified in the following sectors: the mining and producer sector, the banking
sector, the official sector, the investment sector, and the manufacturing sector. A brief description of each follows. 

Mining
and Producer Sector 

This
group includes mining companies that specialize in silver and silver production, mining companies that produce silver as a by-product
of other production (such as a copper or gold producer), scrap merchants and recyclers. 

Banking
Sector 

Bullion
banks provide a variety of services to the silver market and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between other
parties. Services provided by the bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing, physical
silver purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers and silver leasing. 

The
Official Sector 

There
are no official statistics published by the International Monetary Fund, Bank of International Settlements, or national banks
on silver holdings by national governments. The main reason for this is that silver is generally not recognized as a reserve asset.
Consequently, there are very limited silver stocks held by governments. According to The Silver Institute World Silver Survey
2022, the identifiable silver bullion inventories are as follows:

The
Investment Sector 

This
sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional and private investors and speculators. These participants
range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges, and retail-level coin collectors. 

The
Manufacturing Sector 

The
fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of silver. Industrial applications comprise
the largest use of silver. The jewelry and silverware sector is the second largest, followed by the photographic industry (although
the latter has been declining over a number of years as a result of the spread of digital photography).

The
following are some of the main characteristics of the silver market illustrated by the table. 

Like
gold, silver has also been used as a currency in the past. However, the main difference between gold and silver is that while
approximately half of gold demand is used for jewelry, approximately half of silver fabrication demand is used for industrial
applications. 

New
mine production accounts for approximately 82 of total silver supply. Recycled silver accounts for around 17 of total supply. 

Industrial
applications and jewelry demand accounted for over 65 of total demand in 2021. Photography has been taking a lower share of overall
silver demand falling from 5 in 2012 to 3 in 2021, while photovoltaic demand has risen in recent years accounting for 11 in 2021. Investment in ETP s rose significantly in 2020 and represented 28 of demand in 2020. 

Historical
chart of the price of Silver 

The
price of silver is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements
in the price of silver in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors,
including announcements from central banks regarding a country s reserve silver holdings, agreements among central banks,
political uncertainties around the world, and economic concerns. The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of
an ounce of silver in dollars from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2021 and is based on information provided by Bloomberg: 

Source:
Bloomberg, abrdn. Chart data from 12/31/2012 to 12/31/2022. Silver Price = SLVRLND Index. 

Starting
in early 2011, when prices peaked at 48.44 per ounce, silver prices began a downward trend, albeit with multiple upwards
rallies (that have often lasted several months). The rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar, sluggish industrial growth and a
tame inflation environment (which led some investors to revise their expectations of the effects of monetary expansion) were
some of the drivers behind the fall in silver prices from 2011 to 2019. Silver reversed course in 2020, as prices rose
46.75 , closing at 26.49 per ounce, making it the top performer of the four metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium). In
2021, silver took a slight step back after its historic performance in 2020, as it returned -14 (as of December 31, 2021).
As the world emerged out of the pandemic, silver took a backseat to riskier asset classes such as equities which is a reason
for its negative performance during the year. 2022 was a volatile year for silver, as the price reached 26.41
per ounce in the weeks following Russia s invasion of Ukraine, up more than 13 from the end of 2021. However, the price of silver
fell as low as 17.81 per ounce at the beginning of September, as the risk of diminishing global economic growth, and aggressive
interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve caused the U.S. Dollar to strengthen and silver prices to weaken. The potential of
a weakening U.S. Dollar, amidst low silver inventory levels and a reopening Chinese economy, sparked a Q4 rally that saw the price
of silver climb 25.9 over the quarter to close the year at 23.95 per ounce. Despite the volatile year, in 2022 the price of silver
rose 2.8 above its 2021 closing price.

Platinum Group
Metals 

Platinum
and palladium are the two best known metals of the six platinum group metals PGMs ). Platinum and palladium have
the greatest economic importance and are found in the largest quantities. The other four iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and
osmium are produced only as co-products of platinum and palladium. 

PGMs
are found primarily in South Africa and Russia. South Africa is the world s leading platinum producer and one of the largest
palladium producers. Russia is the largest producer of palladium and most production is concentrated in the Norilsk region. All
of South Africa s production is sourced from the Bushveld Igneous Complex, which hosts the world s largest resource
of PGMs. Together, South Africa and Russia accounted for over 84 of platinum supply and 78 of palladium supply in 2021.

The
following are some of the main characteristics of the platinum market illustrated by the table: 

The
main supplier of platinum is South Africa, providing over 74 of total mine supply in 2021. Russia is the second largest supplier
of platinum. Its share of world mine production has averaged around 12.1 of total mine supply over the past ten years. Scrap
supply from recycling of autocatalyst and other sources have accounted for about 25 over the last 10 years. 

Over the past decade, jewelry demand for platinum peaked at 35.6 of total demand in 2014. Jewelry demand
has since declined to 21.9 of total demand in 2021, following a consistent downward trend. Autocatalyst demand for platinum accounted
for nearly 35 of total demand at the end of 2021. Following two consecutive years of growth, investment demand fell from a high
of 14.2 in 2020 into negative territory in 2021 at (0.41 ). Glass demand more than doubled in 2021, reaching a high of 13.52 
of total demand. China accounted for more than 43 of the year over year increase, as Chinese glass companies purchased record
amounts of platinum for current and future expansion projects. Previously tracked under Autocatalyst demand, since 2017 pollution
control demand has increased from 2.31 to 2.95 of total demand. Pollution control demand captures the production demand of non-road
vehicles such as agricultural equipment and industrial machinery as well as small engines and stationary source emissions control
in factories, which use technology that is similar to autocatalysts. 

Historical
Chart of the Price of Platinum 

The
price of platinum is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements
in the price of platinum in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. The following chart illustrates the
movements in the price of an ounce of platinum in U.S. Dollars from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2022 and is based on information
provided by Bloomberg:

In
2012, platinum prices rose on the back of supply disruptions in South Africa, which accounts for more than 72 of the world s
supply of platinum. A strike at one of South Africa s biggest platinum mines caused the price of platinum to rise from 1,387
to 1,709 per ounce in August 2012. At the beginning of 2013, Anglo American Platinum, the world s biggest producer of the
metal, announced its intention to close four mine shafts and its consideration of selling another mine complex as part of a radical
overhaul of its South African operations. This statement prompted a strong reaction on platinum prices, which rose from 1,656
to 1,736 per ounce in the days following the announcement, on fears of a further tightening in platinum supply. However, platinum s
correlation to gold weighed on platinum prices in 2013 overall. Prolonged strikes at South African mines in 2014 led to the deepest
supply deficit in platinum since 1975 (the earliest date we have supply and demand data). However, that failed to arrest the price
slide which saw prices fall 11 in 2014, highlighting the extent of negative sentiment towards industrially-exposed precious metals.
Despite autocatalyst demand for platinum increasing in 2015, tightening nitrogen oxide emission standards have led to pessimism
about the future demand for platinum-heavy diesel autocatalysts relative to palladium-heavy gasoline autocatalysts. Further pessimistic
outlook for South Africa s economy and its currency the South African Rand weighed on platinum prices throughout 2017, and
platinum continued to fall in 2018 driven by lackluster investor sentiment, a stronger US dollar, weaker diesel demand and rising
mine supply. Platinum prices bounced back, rising 19.9 to 952 per ounce at the end of 2019. After seeing the price fall as low
as 593 per ounce on March 19, 2020, platinum rebounded from pandemic lows and finished the year at 1,068 per ounce. The steep
climb in palladium price has led some investors to conclude that platinum appears under-valued, in view of its potential to substitute
for palladium in automotive applications in the future. Additionally, the outlook for mining in South Africa is increasingly uncertain,
with producers facing steep increases in electricity prices, periodic disruption to power supplies and a risk of industrial action
during forthcoming wage negotiations. Similarly to other precious metals, platinum took a back seat to risky assets during 2021
as it returned -10 (as of December 31, 2021). The autocatalyst market took a major step back in 2020, largely related to the
pandemic, which was a major reason for the negative price performance in 2021. 

The price of Platinum reached
as high as 1,151 per ounce on March 8, 2022, as Russian s invasion of Ukraine, production bottlenecks and supply constraints
pushed prices higher. However, while each of the precious metals (Gold, Silver, Palladium) saw prices fluctuate throughout the
year, Platinum s volatility was much more pronounced within the first quarter as the price fell roughly 15 by March 31st,
to close the first quarter at 983 per ounce. Aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, a strong U.S. Dollar
and risks of diminishing global economic growth exerted additional pressure on prices, as the price of platinum fell as low as
 831 per ounce on July 14th, 2022. Through the end of the year, increasing autocatalyst demand and a growing substitution of platinum
for palladium contributed to ongoing physical market tightness, despite a global surplus, which saw the price of platinum increase
roughly 24 from July 14th through December 31st. As a result of the rally to end the year, Platinum was the strongest performing
precious metal in 2022, as the spot price increased 7.5 to 1,031/oz. during the year.

The
following are some of the main characteristics of the palladium market illustrated by the table: 

Russia
has traditionally been the largest producer of palladium, providing on average 41 of supply over the past 10 years. South Africa
has, on average, supplied approximately 37 of production over the past 10 years. In 2021, Russia provided 39.6 of mine supplies,
while South Africa produced 39 . North America contributed approximately 13 of mine supply in 2021. Scrap supply, from recycling
of autocatalyst and other sources, has accounted for an average of roughly 32 of total supply over the last 5 years, up from
26 in 2012. Autocatalysts continue to be the largest component of palladium demand, representing nearly 83 of total demand in
2021, down from a high of 85 of total demand in 2020. Jewelry demand for palladium has tapered off considerably over the last
10 years, contributing only 0.9 of total demand in 2021, down from a high of 4.5 in 2012 . Other industrial demand (chemical,
dental and electrical) has fallen from 22.4 of total demand in 2012 to 14.4 of total demand in 2021. Since 2017 pollution control
demand has increased from 0.8 to 1 of total demand. Pollution control demand captures the production demand for emissions control
in non-automotive applications. 

Historical
Chart of the Price of Palladium 

The
price of palladium is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements
in the price of palladium in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. The following chart illustrates the movements
in the price of an ounce of palladium in U.S. Dollars from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2022 and is based on information
provided by Bloomberg:

12/31/2022. Palladium Price = PLDMLNPM Index. 

Rising
palladium prices tempered in 2011, but concerns over supply shortages due to labor problems at mines in South Africa and dwindling
Russian stocks provided some price support into mid-2012. Palladium rose to a 13 year high of 907 per ounce in September 2014,
a 27 increase from the start of the year. The rally was driven by supply side concerns following the longest strike in South
African mining history and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The strong rally in 2014 was completely unwound in
2015, when South African mine supply resumed back to pre-strike levels and pessimism about industrial demand in China overwhelmed
the true tightness in the market. Palladium was then the top performer of the precious metals complex for 3 consecutive years
from 2017 to 2019, where it rose nearly 182 from 676 per troy ounce on December 31, 2016 to 1,905 per troy ounce on December
31, 2019. The price of palladium reached an all-time high of 2,781/oz on February 19, 2020, before closing out the year at a
price of 2,342/oz on December 31, 2020. Similar to other precious metals, palladium took a step back in 2021 as it returned -16 
(as of December 31, 2021). A decline in autocatalyst demand due to the pandemic was a big reason for the negative performance
seen during the year. 

The
price of Palladium reached a record high of 3,015 per ounce on March 7, 2022, as Russian s invasion of Ukraine infused
uncertainty into global markets and created additional price pressure that pushed the price of palladium nearly 53 above its
2021 close. While each of the precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum) saw prices fluctuate throughout the year, the price of
palladium showed greater correlation with the price of Platinum during the first quarter. The price of palladium fell by roughly
25 between March 8th and March 31st, ending the first quarter at a price of 2,259 per ounce. On June 14th, 2022 the price of
palladium fell as low as 1,810 per ounce, as aggressive interest rate policies from the U.S. Federal Reserve drove the U.S. Dollar
higher. Contrary to the other three precious metals, the price of palladium increased as high as 2,315 per ounce on October 4th,
2022, as supplies were further constrained by operational challenges in South African and North American mines, as well as a weaker
automotive recycling market. Throughout the year, tailwinds from supply disruptions were countered by weaker automotive and investment
demand, higher interest rates and the risk of a potential recession. As a result, while the other three precious metals rallied
to end the year, the price of palladium reversed course during the fourth quarter to end the year at 1,775 per ounce, down 10 
from the end of 2021. 

Operation
of the Bullion Markets 

The
global trade in Bullion consists of Over-the-Counter OTC transactions in spot, forwards, and options and
other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options. 

Global
Over-The-Counter Market 

The
OTC market trades on a 24-hour per day continuous basis and accounts for most global Bullion trading. 

Market
makers, as well as others in the OTC market, trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All
risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. 

For
gold and silver, market makers include the market-making members of the London Bullion Market Association LBMA ),
the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in
the London bullion market. The twelve market-making members of the LBMA are: BNP Paribas SA, Citibank N.A., Credit Suisse AG Zurich,
HSBC, Goldman Sachs International, ICBC Standard Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Merrill Lynch International, Morgan Stanley 
Co. International Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank and UBS AG. 

For
platinum and palladium, five member participants of the London Platinum and Palladium Market LPPM ), the trade association
that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the LPPM, are currently
participating in the London Metal Exchange Fix LME Fix ). The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in
terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet clients 
requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. 

The
main centers of the OTC market are London, Zurich and New York for gold and silver and London, New York, Hong Kong and Zurich
for platinum and palladium. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors
and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these market centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities
in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business, typically involving jewelry and small bars of gold or silver and
small plates or ingots of platinum or palladium (1 kilogram or less) and will hedge their exposure by selling into one of these
main OTC centers. Precious metals dealers have offices around the world and most of the world s major bullion dealers are
either members or associate members of the LBMA and/or the LPPM. 

In
the OTC market for gold, the standard size of trades between market makers ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer spreads
are typically 50 US cents per ounce. Certain dealers are willing to offer clients competitive prices for much larger volumes,
including trades over 100,000 ounces, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions, as transaction
costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely. Cost indicators can be obtained from various
information service providers as well as dealers. 

In
the OTC market for silver, the standard size of trades between market makers is 100,000 ounces. 

10 

In
the OTC market for platinum and palladium, the standard size of trades between market makers is 1,000 ounces. 

Liquidity
in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected
in adjustments to dealing spreads the differential between a dealer s buy and sell prices.
The period of greatest liquidity in the Bullion markets generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time
zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York, Zurich and other centers
coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. COMEX ), a designated contract market
within the CME Group. This period lasts for approximately four hours each New York business day morning. 

The
Gold Bullion Market 

The
London Gold Bullion Market 

Although
the market for physical gold is distributed globally, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating
market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of
the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the Good Delivery List, which
is a list of LBMA accredited refiners of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices
and develops standard documentation. 

The
terms loco London gold and loco Zurich gold refer to gold physically held in London and Zurich, respectively,
that meets the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of a
LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars published
by the LBMA. Gold bars meeting these requirements are described in this annual report from time to time as London Good
Delivery Bars. The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose gram conversion is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy
ounces and 1 troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction
on the OTC market. Typically referred to as 400-ounce bars, a London Good Delivery Bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy
ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5 ), be of good appearance and be easy to handle
and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of
0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar. A London Good Delivery Bar must also bear the stamp of one of the refiners who
are on the LBMA approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the gold spot price always refers to that of a London Good Delivery
Bar. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems. 

On
March 20, 2015, ICE Benchmark Administration IBA began administering the operation of an equilibrium auction, 
which is an electronic, tradable and auditable, over-the-counter auction market with the ability to settle trades in US Dollars USD ), Euros or British Pounds for LBMA-authorized participating gold bullion banks or market makers gold
participants that establishes a reference gold price for that day s trading. IBA s equilibrium auction is
the gold valuation replacement selected by the LBMA for the London gold fix previously determined by the London Gold Market Fixing
Ltd. that was discontinued on March 19, 2015. IBA s equilibrium auction, like the previous gold fixing process, establishes
and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of gold twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 10:30 a.m.
London time (the LBMA AM Gold Price and 3:00 p.m. London time (the LBMA PM Gold Price ). 

Daily
during London trading hours the LBMA AM Gold Price and the LBMA PM Gold Price each provide reference gold prices for that day s
trading. Many long-term contracts will be priced on either the basis of the LBMA AM Gold Price or the LBMA PM Gold Price, and
market participants will usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The LBMA AM
Gold Price and the LBMA PM Gold Price, determined according to the methodologies of IBA and disseminated electronically by IBA
to selected major market data vendors, such as Refinitiv and Bloomberg, are widely used benchmarks for daily gold prices and are
quoted by various financial information sources as the London gold fix was previously. The Trust values its gold on the basis
of the LBMA PM Gold Price. 

11 

The
LBMA PM Gold Price is the result of an equilibrium auction because it establishes a price for a troy ounce of gold
that clears the maximum amount of bids and offers for gold entered by order-submitting gold participants each day. The opening
bid and subsequent bid prices are generated by an algorithm based method, and each auction is actively supervised by IBA staff.
There are currently 15 direct gold participants (Bank of China, Citibank N.A. London Branch, Coins N
Things, Inc., DRW Investments, LLC, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA NA, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), StoneX Financial
Ltd., Jane Street Global Trading, LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. London Branch, Koch Supply and Trading LP, Marex, Morgan Stanley,
Standard Chartered Bank and Toronto-Dominion Bank), and IBA uses ICE s front-end system, WebICE, as the technology platform
that allows direct participants as well as sponsored clients to manage their orders in the auction in real time via their own
screens. 

The
IBA auction process begins with a notice of an auction round issued to gold participants before the commencement of the auction
round stating a gold price in U.S. Dollars, at which the auction round will be conducted. An auction round lasts 30 seconds. Gold
participants electronically place bid and offer orders at the round s stated price and indicate whether the orders are for
their own account or for the account of clients. Aggregate bid and offer volume will be shown live on WebICE, providing a level
playing field for all participants. 

At
the end of the auction round, the IBA system evaluates the equilibrium of the bid and offer orders submitted. If bid and offer
orders indicate an imbalance outside of acceptable tolerances established for the IBA system (normally 10,000 oz) (e.g., too many
purchase orders submitted compared to sell orders or vice versa), the auction chairman calculates a new auction round price principally
based on the volume weighting of bid and offer orders submitted in the immediately completed auction round. For instance, if the
order imbalance indicates that purchase orders (bids) outweigh sales orders (offers) then a new auction round price will be issued
that will be increased over that used in the prior auction round. Likewise, the new auction round price will be decreased from
the prior round s price if offers outweigh bids. To clear the imbalance, the IBA system then issues another notice of auction
round to gold participants at the newly calculated price. During this next 30 second auction round, gold participants again submit
orders, and after it ends, the IBA system evaluates for order imbalances. If order imbalances persist, a new auction price is
calculated and a further auction round will occur. This auction round process continues until an equilibrium within specified
tolerances is determined to exist. Once the IBA system determines that orders are in equilibrium within system tolerances, the
auction process ends and the equilibrium auction round price becomes the LBMA PM Gold Price. 

The
LBMA PM Gold Price and all bid and offer order information for all auction rounds become publicly available electronically via
IBA instantly after the conclusion of the equilibrium auction. Since April 1, 2015, the LBMA Gold Price has been regulated
by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA in the United Kingdom UK ). IBA also has an Oversight Committee,
made up of market participants, industry bodies, direct participant representatives, infrastructure providers and IBA. The Oversight
Committee allows the LBMA to continue to have significant involvement in the oversight of the auction process, including, among
other matters, changes to the methodology and accreditation of direct participants. Additionally, IBA watches over the price discovery
process for the LBMA Gold Price and ensures that it meets the International Organization of Securities Commission s
(IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the IOSCO Principles ). 

The
LBMA PM Gold Price is widely viewed as a full and fair representation of all or material market interest at the conclusion of
the equilibrium auction. IBA s LBMA PM Gold Price electronic auction methodology is similar to the non-electronic process
previously used to establish the London gold fix where the London gold fix process adjusted the gold price up or down until all
the buy and sell orders are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LBMA PM Gold Price has several
advantages over the previous London gold fix. The LBMA PM Gold Price auction process is fully transparent in real time to the
gold participants and, at the close of each equilibrium auction, to the general public. 

The
LBMA PM Gold Price auction process is also fully auditable by third parties since an audit trail exists from the time of each
notice of an auction round. Moreover, the LBMA PM Gold Price s audit trail and active, real time surveillance of the auction
process by IBA as well as FCA s oversight of IBA, deters manipulative and abusive conduct in establishing each day s
LBMA PM Gold Price. 

12 

Since
March 20, 2015, the Sponsor determined that the London gold fix, which ceased to be published as of March 19, 2015, could no longer
serve as a basis for valuing gold bullion received upon purchase of the Trust s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the
Trust s Shares and otherwise held by the Trust on a daily basis, and that the LBMA PM Gold Price is an appropriate alternative
for determining the value of the Trust s gold each trading day. The Sponsor also determined that the LBMA PM Gold Price
fairly represents the commercial value of gold bullion held by the Trust and the Benchmark Price (as defined in
Trust Agreement) as of any day is the LBMA PM Gold Price for such day. 

The
Zurich Gold Bullion Market 

After
London, the second principal center for spot or physical gold trading is Zurich. For eight hours a day, trading occurs simultaneously
in London and Zurich with Zurich normally opening and closing an hour earlier than London. During these hours, Zurich closely
rivals London in its influence over the spot price because of the importance of the three major Swiss banks Credit Suisse,
Swiss Bank Corporation, and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in the physical gold market. Each of these banks has long maintained
its own refinery, often taking physical delivery of gold and processing it for other regional markets. The loco Zurich bullion
specification is the same as for the London bullion market, which allows for gold physically located in Zurich to be quoted loco
London and vice versa. 

Futures
Exchanges 

The
most significant gold futures exchanges are the COMEX, a designated contract market within the CME Group, and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange TOCOM ). The COMEX is
the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and has been trading gold since 1974. The TOCOM
has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures
and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market
turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin.
Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract
holder. The COMEX trades gold futures almost continuously (with one short break in the evening) through its CME Globex electronic
trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On June 6, 2003, TOCOM adopted a similar clearing system. In each
case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. 

Other
Exchanges 

There
are other gold exchange markets, such as the Istanbul Gold Exchange (trading gold since 1995), the Shanghai Gold Exchange (trading
gold since 2002), the Hong Kong Chinese Gold Silver Exchange Society (trading gold since 1918) and the Singapore Mercantile
Exchange (trading gold since 2010). 

The
Silver Market 

The
London Silver Bullion Market 

Although
the market for physical silver is distributed globally, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating
market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of
the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the Good Delivery List, which
is a list of LBMA accredited refiners of silver. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading
practices and develops standard documentation. 

13 

The
term loco London silver refers to silver physically held in London that meets the specifications for weight, dimensions,
fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of a LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in The
Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars published by the LBMA. Silver bars meeting these requirements are described
in this report from time to time as Silver Good Delivery Bars. The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose
conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A Silver Good
Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. A Silver Good Delivery Bar must contain
between 750 troy ounces and 1,100 troy ounces of silver with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.0 parts per 1,000. A Silver
Good Delivery Bar must also bear the stamp of one of the refiners who are on the LBMA-approved list. Unless otherwise specified,
the silver spot price always refers to that of a Silver Good Delivery Bar. Business is generally conducted over the phone and
through electronic dealing systems. 

On
July 14, 2017, the LBMA announced that ICE Benchmark Administration IBA had been selected to be the third-party
administrator for the LBMA Silver Price . Effective from October 2, 2017, IBA is providing the auction platform and
methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Silver Price benchmark. IBA operates an equilibrium
auction , which is an electronic, tradable and auditable, over-the-counter auction for LBMA-authorized participating silver
bullion banks or market makers and sponsored clients of direct participants silver participants that establishes
a reference silver price for that day s trading, often referred to as the LBMA Silver Price . The LBMA Silver
Price equilibrium auction operated by CME Group Inc. and Refinitiv prior to October 2, 2017 was selected by the LBMA as the silver
valuation replacement for the London silver fix previously determined by the London Silver Market Fixing Ltd. that was discontinued
on August 14, 2014. The LBMA Silver Price has become a widely used benchmark for daily silver prices and is quoted by various
financial information sources as the London silver fix was previously. 

The
LBMA Silver Price is the result of an equilibrium auction because it establishes a price for a troy ounce of Silver
Good Delivery Bars that clears the maximum amount of bids and offers for silver entered by order-submitting silver participants
each day. IBA uses ICE s front-end system, WebICE, as the technology platform that allows direct participants, as well as
sponsored clients of direct participants, to manage their orders in the auction in real time via their own desktops. As the IBA
electronic silver auction market develops, IBA expects to admit additional silver participants to the order submission process.
The benchmark is published when the auction finishes, typically a few minutes after 12:00 noon (London time). 

At
the opening of each auction, IBA in the role of auction chairman Chairman announces an opening price (in U.S.
Dollars), that takes into account current market conditions and begins auction rounds, with an expected duration of at least 30
seconds each. During each auction round, participants may enter the volume they wish to buy or sell at that price, and such orders
will be part of the price formation. Aggregate bid and offer volume is shown live on WebICE. At the end of each auction round,
the total net volume is calculated. If this imbalance is larger than the imbalance tolerance (normally 500,000 oz.)
then the Chairman sets a new price (based on the current market conditions, and the direction and magnitude of the imbalance in
the round) and begins a new auction round. If the imbalance is less than the tolerance, then the auction is complete with all
volume tradeable at that price. The price is then set in U.S. Dollars and also converted into other currencies, including Australian
Dollars, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Onshore and Offshore Yuan, Indian Rupees, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Russian
Rubles, Singapore Dollars, South African Rand, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars, Thai Baht and Turkish Lira. The auction is run
at 12:00 noon (London time). 

During
the auction, the price at the start of each round, and the volumes at the end of each round are available through major market
data vendors. As soon as the auction finishes, the final prices and volumes are available through major market data vendors. IBA
also publishes transparency reports, detailing the prices, volumes and times for each round of the auction. These transparency
reports are available through major market data vendors and IBA when the auction finishes. The process can also be observed real-time
through a WebICE screen. The auction mechanism provides a complete audit trail. 

There
are currently thirteen direct participants who have been accredited to contribute to the LBMA Silver Price: Citibank N.A. London
Branch, Coins 'N Things Inc., DRW Investments, LLC, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA NA, Jane Street Global Trading LLC,
JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A London Branch, Koch Supply and Trading LP, Marex, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered Bank, StoneX Financial
Ltd. and The Toronto Dominion Bank. 

14 

Since
April 1, 2015, the LBMA Silver Price has been regulated by the FCA in the UK. IBA is authorized as a regulated benchmark administrator
by the FCA. Under the UK benchmark regulation, the governance structure for a regulated benchmark must include an Oversight Committee,
made up of market participants, industry bodies, direct participant representatives, infrastructure providers and the administrator
(i.e., IBA). Through the Oversight Committee the LBMA continues to have significant involvement in the oversight of the auction
process, including, among other matters, changes to the methodology and accreditation of direct participants. The price discovery
process for the LBMA Silver Price is subject to surveillance by IBA. IBA has been formally assessed against the IOSCO Principles.
In order to meet the IOSCO Principles, the price discovery used for the LBMA Silver Price benchmark is auditable and transparent. 

The
LBMA Silver Price is viewed as a full and fair representation of all market interest at the conclusion of the auction. IBA s
auction process is similar to CME Group s auction process, which in turn was similar to the non-electronic process previously
used to establish the London silver fix where the London silver fix process adjusted the silver price up or down until all the
buy and sell orders are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LBMA Silver Price has several advantages
over the previous London silver fix. IBA s auction process is fully transparent in real-time to direct participants and
sponsored clients and, at the close of each auction, to the general public. IBA s auction process is also fully auditable
since an audit trail exists for every change made in the process. Moreover, the audit trail and active surveillance of the auction
process by IBA, as well as the FCA s oversight of IBA, deters manipulative and abusive conduct in establishing each day s
LBMA Silver Price. 

Since
August 15, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London silver fix, which ceased to be published as of that date, would be an
inappropriate basis for valuing silver bullion received upon purchase of the Trust s Shares, delivered upon redemption of
the Trust s Shares and otherwise held by the Trust on a daily basis, and that the LBMA Silver Price is an appropriate alternative
for determining the value of the Trust s silver each trading day. The Sponsor also determined that the LBMA Silver Price
fairly represents the commercial value of silver bullion held by the Trust and that the Benchmark Price (as defined
in the Trust Agreement) as of any day is the LBMA Silver Price for such day. 

Futures
Exchanges 

The
most significant silver futures exchanges are the COMEX and the TOCOM. Futures exchanges seek to provide a neutral, regulated
marketplace for the trading of derivatives contracts for commodities. Futures contracts are defined by the exchange for each commodity.
For each commodity traded, this contract specifies the precise quality and quantity standards. The contract s terms and
conditions also define the location and timing of physical delivery. 

An
exchange does not buy or sell those contracts, but seeks to offer a transparent forum where members, on their own behalf or on
the behalf of customers, can trade the contracts in a safe, efficient and orderly manner. During regular trading hours at the
COMEX, the commodity contracts are traded on CME Globex system, an electronic auction in which all bids, offers and trades
must be publicly announced to all members and, upon execution, centrally cleared. Electronic trading is offered by the exchange
almost 24 hours a day (except for a short break in the evening), six days a week. 

In
addition to the public nature of the pricing, futures exchanges in the United States are regulated at two levels: internal and
external governmental supervision. The internal is performed through self-regulation and consists of regular monitoring of the
following: the central algorithmic matching process to ensure that it is conducted in conformance with all exchange rules; the
orderly trading and settlement of futures and options; the financial condition of all exchange member firms to ensure that they
continuously meet financial commitments; and the volume positions of commercial and non-commercial customers to ensure that physical
delivery and other commercial commitments can be met, and that pricing is not being improperly affected by the size of any particular
customer positions. External governmental oversight is performed by the CFTC, which reviews all the rules and regulations of United
States futures exchanges and clearing houses and monitors their enforcement.

The
Platinum Market 

The
Zurich and London Platinum Bullion Market 

Although
the market for physical platinum is distributed globally, most platinum is stored and most OTC market trades are cleared through
Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, London also serves as a center for the clearing of OTC trades in platinum. In addition to coordinating
market activities, the LPPM acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of
the LPPM is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the London/Zurich Good Delivery Lists, 
which are the lists of LPPM accredited refiners of platinum. The LPPM also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes
good trading practices and develops standard documentation. 

Platinum
is traded generally on a loco Zurich basis, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in Zurich or
is transferred into accounts established in Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, platinum began trading on a loco London 
basis as well, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in London or is transferred into accounts established in
London. The basis for settlement and delivery of a loco Zurich spot trade is payment (generally in U.S. Dollars) two business
days after the trade date against delivery. Delivery of the platinum can either be by physical delivery or through the clearing
systems to an unallocated account. 

The
unit of trade in London and Zurich is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams is equivalent to 32.1507465
troy ounces, and one troy ounce is equivalent to 31.1034768 grams. A good delivery platinum plate or ingot is acceptable for delivery
in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market (a Good Delivery Platinum Plate or Ingot ). A Good Delivery Platinum
Plate or Ingot must contain between 32 and 192 troy ounces of platinum with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per
1,000 (99.95 ), be of good appearance, and be easy to handle and stack. The platinum content of a platinum Good Delivery Platinum
Plate or Ingot is calculated by multiplying the gross weight by the fineness of the plate or ingot. A Good Delivery Platinum Plate
or Ingot must also bear the stamp of one of the refiners who are on the LPPM approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the platinum
spot price always refers to the Good Delivery Standards set by the LPPM. Business is generally conducted over the
phone and through electronic dealing systems. 

Since
December 1, 2014, the LME has been administering the operation of an electronic platinum bullion price fixing systems LMEbullion that replicates electronically the manual London platinum fix processes previously employed by the London Platinum and Palladium
Fixing Company Ltd LPPFCL ), as well as providing electronic market clearing processes for platinum bullion transactions
at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. The LME s electronic price fixing processes, like the previous
London platinum fix processes, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of platinum twice each London trading day
during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45 a.m. London time (the LME AM Fix and 2:00 p.m. London time (the LME
PM Fix ). In addition to utilizing the same London platinum fix standards and methods, the LME also supervises the platinum
electronic price fixing processes through its market operations, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling
capabilities in order to support the integrity of the LME PM Fix. The LME, in administering LMEbullion, uses a pricing methodology
that meets the administrative and regulatory needs of platinum market participants, including the IOSCO Principles. 

Daily
during London trading hours the LME AM Fix and the LME PM Fix each provide reference platinum prices for that day s trading.
Many long-term contracts are priced on the basis of either the LME AM Fix or the LME PM Fix, and market participants will usually
refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The Trust values its platinum on the basis
of the LME PM Fix. 

The
LME PM Fix results from LMEbullion. Formal participation in the LME PM Fix is limited to participating LPPM members. Five LPPM
member participants are currently participating in establishing the LME PM Fix (Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank USA NA,
ICBC Standard Bank plc, Johnson Matthey plc and BASF Metals Ltd.). Any other market participant wishing to participate in the
trading on the LME PM Fix is required to do so through one of the participating LPPM members. 

16 

Orders
are placed either with one of the participating LPPM member participants or with another precious metals dealer who will then
be in contact with a participating LPPM member during the fixing. The fix begins with the chair of the pricing function submitting
an opening price into the administration screen in LMEbullion, reflecting the market price and other data, prevailing at the opening
of the fix. This is relayed by the LPPM member participants to their dealing rooms which have direct communication with all interested
parties. Any member participant may enter the fixing process at any time, or adjust or withdraw his order. The platinum price
is adjusted up or down until all the buy and sell orders are electronically matched, at which time the price is declared fixed.
All orders are transacted on the basis of this fixed price, which is instantly relayed to the market through various media. 

The
LBMA and the LME have asserted that the LME s electronic price fixing processes are similar to the non-electronic processes
previously used to establish the applicable London platinum fix where the London platinum fix process adjusted the platinum price
up or down until all the buy and sell orders entered by the participating LPPM members are matched, at which time the price was
declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LME PM Fix has several advantages over the previous London platinum fix. The LME s electronic
price fixing processes are intended to be transparent. The LME asserts that its electronic price fixing processes are fully auditable
by third parties since an audit trail exists from the beginning of each fixing session. The LME also asserts that the market operation,
compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities of the LME will support the integrity of the LME PM
Fix. 

Since
December 1, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London platinum fix, which has been revised based on the new LME method and
is now known as the LBMA Platinum Price (PM), which we refer to herein as the LME PM Fix, is an appropriate basis for valuing
platinum bullion received upon purchase of the Trust s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust s Shares and
for determining the value of the Trust s platinum bullion each trading day. The Benchmark Price (as defined
in the Trust Agreement) of the Trust s platinum bullion as of any day is the LME PM Fix for such day. 

As
of December 1, 2014, the LPPFCL transferred the ownership of the historic and future intellectual property of the twice daily
 fix for platinum and palladium bullion to a subsidiary company of the LBMA. 

Futures
Exchanges 

The
most significant platinum futures exchanges are the COMEX and the TOCOM. The COMEX is the largest exchange in the world for
trading precious metals futures and options and launched platinum futures in 1956, followed with options in 1990. The TOCOM has
been trading platinum since 1984. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures
and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market
turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the platinum represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on
margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against
the contract holder. The COMEX trades platinum futures almost continuously (with one short break in the evening) through its CME
Globex electronic trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On June 6, 2003, the TOCOM adopted a similar
clearing system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. 

The
Palladium Market 

The
Zurich and London Palladium Bullion Markets 

Although
the market for physical palladium is distributed globally, most palladium is stored and most OTC market trades are cleared through
Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, London also serves as a center for the clearing of OTC trades in palladium. In addition to coordinating

Market
Regulation 

The
global gold, silver, platinum and palladium markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations.
In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. In the United
Kingdom, responsibility for the regulation of the financial market participants, including the major participating members of
the LBMA and the LPPM, falls under the authority of the FCA as provided by the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 FSM Act ). Under this act, all UK-based banks, together with other investment firms, are subject to a range
of requirements, including fitness and properness, capital adequacy, liquidity, and systems and controls. 

The
FCA is responsible for regulating investment products, including derivatives, and those who deal in investment products. Regulation
of spot, commercial forwards, and deposits of gold, silver, platinum and palladium not covered by the FSM Act is provided
for by The London Code of Conduct for Non-Investment Products, which was established by market participants in conjunction with
the Bank of England. 

The
TOCOM has authority to perform financial and operational surveillance on its members trading activities, scrutinize positions
held by members and large-scale customers, and monitor the price movements of futures markets by comparing them with cash and
other derivative markets prices. To act as a Futures Commission Merchant Broker on the TOCOM, a broker must obtain a license
from Japan s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry METI ), the regulatory authority that oversees the operations
of the TOCOM. 

19 

The
CFTC regulates trading in commodity contracts, such as futures, options and swaps. In addition, under the CEA, the CFTC has jurisdiction
to prosecute manipulation and fraud in any commodity (including precious metals) traded in interstate commerce as spot as well
as deliverable forwards. The CFTC is the exclusive regulator of U.S. commodity exchanges and clearing houses. 

Secondary
Market Trading 

While
the Trust s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the prices of gold, silver, platinum
and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust, less the expenses of the Trust, the Shares may trade in the secondary market
on the NYSE Arca at prices that are lower or higher relative to their net asset value (the value of the Trust s assets less
its liabilities NAV )) per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV
per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca, COMEX and the London and Zurich gold,
silver, platinum and palladium markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 PM New York time, liquidity in the
global bullion markets is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during this time, trading
spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen. 

Valuation
of Bullion and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On
each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day Evaluation Time ), the Trustee will evaluate the Bullion held by the Trust and determine both the ANAV and the NAV
of the Trust. 

At
the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust s Bullion on the basis of that day s London Metal Price for
such metal or, if no London Metal Price is made for a metal on such day or has not been announced by the Evaluation
Time, the next most recent London Metal Price announced for such metal determined prior to the Evaluation Time
will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor
determines that the applicable London Metal Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly
represents the commercial value of the Trust s Bullion metal is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s
Bullion metal, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor
the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the London Metal Price or such other publicly available
price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust s Bullion or for any determination as to the alternative
basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith. See Operation of the Bullion Markets 
for a description of the London Metal Price for each Bullion metal. 

Once
the value of the gold, silver, platinum and palladium has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but
unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place which are computed by reference
to the value of the Trust or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the Bullion
and any other assets of the Trust. The resulting figure is the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the
Sponsor s Fee. 

All
fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place which are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or
its assets are calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The Trustee subtracts from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees
so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share
by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes
the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

Any
estimate of the accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities of the Trust for purposes of computing the NAV of the Trust
and ANAV made by the Trustee in good faith shall be conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction
in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those
actually paid. 

The
Sponsor and the Shareholders (as defined below) may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Trustee, and the Sponsor has no responsibility
for the evaluation s accuracy. The determinations the Trustee makes will be made in good faith upon the basis of, and the
Trustee will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Trustee will not be liable
to the Sponsor, DTC, Authorized Participants, the Shareholders or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding
liability exclusion will not protect the Trustee against any liability resulting from bad faith or gross negligence in the performance
of its duties. 

20 

Trust
Expenses 

The
Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor s Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor
has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee
and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements
(defined below), Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum
in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust's organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the
applicable SEC registration fees. 

The
Sponsor s Fee accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.60 of the ANAV of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears.
The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s Fee at its discretion for a stated
period of time. Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of its fee. 

Furthermore,
the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, agree to rebate all or a portion of the Sponsor s Fee attributable to Shares held
by certain institutional investors subject to minimum shareholding and lock up requirements as determined by the Sponsor to foster
stability in the Trust s asset levels. Any such rebate will be subject to negotiation and written agreement between the
Sponsor and the investor on a case by case basis. The Sponsor is under no obligation to provide any rebates of the Sponsor s
Fee. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee will be a party to any Sponsor s Fee rebate arrangements negotiated by the Sponsor.
Any Sponsor s Fee rebate shall be paid from the funds of the Sponsor and not from the assets of the Trust. 

The
Sponsor s Fee is paid by delivery of Bullion to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated
basis, monthly on the first business day of the month in respect of fees payable for the prior month. The delivery is of that
number of ounces of gold, silver, platinum and palladium which equals the daily accrual of the Sponsor s Fee for such prior
month calculated at the applicable London Metal Price. The gold, silver, platinum and palladium delivered to pay the Sponsor s
Fee shall be in such proportion so as to ensure that the Bullion held by the Trust following such transfer is in the same ratio
of metals as the Bullion delivered for the Creation Basket Deposits. 

The
Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell Bullion in
such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The
Trustee is authorized to sell Bullion at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they
become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than Bullion. Accordingly,
the amount of Bullion to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and the
market prices of Bullion. The Custodian is authorized to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, Bullion
needed to cover Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor at the prices used by the Trustee to determine the value of the Bullion
held by the Trust on the date of the sale. 

The
Sponsor s Fee for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 6,222,876 (December 31, 2021: 5,840,530; December 31, 2020: 3,821,435). 

Cash
held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust s expenses will not bear any interest. Each delivery or sale of Bullion by the Trust to pay the Sponsor s Fee or other Trust expenses will be a taxable event
to Shareholders. 

21 

Creation
and Redemption of Shares 

The
Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares).
The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust
of the amount of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed,
the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined
on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized
Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered
broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, which are not required
to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions, and (2) participants in DTC. To become an Authorized Participant,
a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Authorized Participant Agreement
provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the Bullion and any cash required for
such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended
by the Trustee and the Sponsor, without the consent of any Shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants pay
a transaction fee of 500 to the Trustee for each order they place to create or redeem one or more Baskets. Authorized Participants
who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement
of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust for serving as an Authorized Participant, and no such person has any obligation
or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. 

Authorized
Participants are cautioned that some of their activities will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a
manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of
the Securities Act, as described in Plan of Distribution. 

Prior
to initiating any creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have entered into an agreement with the Custodian
or a Bullion clearing bank to establish an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account in London or Zurich Authorized Participant
Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement ). Bullion held in Authorized Participant Unallocated Accounts is typically not segregated
from the Custodian s or other Bullion clearing bank s assets, as a consequence of which an Authorized Participant
will have no proprietary interest in any specific bars of gold or silver or plates or ingots of platinum or palladium held by
the Custodian or the clearing bank. Credits to its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account are therefore at risk of the Custodian s
or other Bullion clearing bank s insolvency. No fees will be charged by the Custodian for the use of the Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account as long as the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is used solely for Bullion transfers to and from
the Trust Unallocated Account and the Custodian (or one of its affiliates) receives compensation for maintaining the Trust Allocated
Account. Authorized Participants should be aware that the Custodian s liability threshold under the Authorized Participant
Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement is generally gross negligence, not negligence, which is the Custodian s liability
threshold under the Trust s Custody Agreements. 

As
the terms of the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement differ in certain respects from the terms of the
Trust s Unallocated Account Agreement, potential Authorized Participants should review the terms of the Authorized Participant
Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement carefully. A copy of the Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained by potential Authorized
Participants from the Trustee. 

Certain
Authorized Participants are expected to have the facility to participate directly in the physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium
markets and the Bullion futures markets. In some cases, an Authorized Participant may from time to time acquire Bullion from or
sell Bullion to its affiliated Bullion trading desk, which may profit in these instances. Each Authorized Participant must be
registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act and regulated by FINRA or
be exempt from being or otherwise not be required to be so regulated or registered, and must be qualified to act as a broker or
dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants are
regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures,
internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime. 

22 

Authorized
Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants
that wish to create or redeem Baskets. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of
multiple clients. As of the date of this report, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas, LLC have each signed an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Trust and, upon the effectiveness of such agreement, may create and redeem Baskets as described above. Persons
interested in purchasing Baskets should contact the Sponsor or the Trustee to obtain the contact information for the Authorized
Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants are only able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant. 

All
Bullion will be delivered to the Trust and distributed by the Trust in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized
Participant Unallocated Accounts and the Trust Unallocated Account. Bullion transferred from an Authorized Participant Unallocated
Account to the Trust in unallocated form will first be credited to the Trust Unallocated Account. Thereafter, the Custodian will
allocate specific bars of gold and silver and allocate, or cause the allocation by the Zurich Sub-Custodian of, specific plates
or ingots of platinum, in each case representing the amount of Bullion credited to the Trust Unallocated Account (to the extent
such amount is representable by whole gold or silver bars or platinum or palladium plates or ingots) to the Trust Allocated Account.
The movement of Bullion is reversed for the distribution of Bullion to an Authorized Participant in connection with the redemption
of Baskets. 

All
physical gold represented by a credit to any Authorized Participant Unallocated Account and to the Trust Unallocated Account and
all physical gold held in the Trust Allocated Account with the Custodian must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of
995 parts per 1,000 (99.5 and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations practices and customs of the LBMA, including the specifications
for a London Good Delivery Bar. 

All
physical silver represented by a credit to any Authorized Participant Unallocated Account and to the Trust Unallocated Account
and all physical silver held in the Trust Allocated Account with the Custodian must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity)
of 999.0 parts per 1,000 (99.9 and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, including
the specifications for a Silver Good Delivery Bar. 

All
physical platinum or palladium represented by a credit to any Authorized Participant Unallocated Account and to the Trust Unallocated
Account and all physical platinum or palladium held in the Trust Allocated Account with the Custodian or for the Custodian by
the Zurich Sub-Custodians must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95 and otherwise conform
to the rules, regulations practices and customs of the LPPM, including the specifications for a Good Delivery Platinum Plate or
Ingot or a Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot, as applicable 

 Under
the Authorized Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

Loco
London and Loco Zurich Platinum and Palladium Delivery Elections. 

Although
all delivery of gold and silver in relation to the creation or redemption of a Basket will be conducted loco London,
Authorized Participants can elect to deliver platinum or palladium loco London or loco Zurich in connection with the creation
of a Basket. Authorized Participants can also elect to receive delivery of platinum or palladium loco London or loco Zurich
in connection with the redemption of a Basket. A Basket creation order that elects to deliver all Bullion loco London will
cause the Custodian to effect an allocation of such Bullion to the Trust Allocated Account maintained by the Custodian in its
London vault premises. A Basket creation order that elects to deliver (i) platinum, (ii) palladium or (iii) platinum and
palladium loco Zurich will cause the Custodian to effect an allocation of such platinum or palladium to the Trust Allocated
Account maintained by the Zurich Sub-Custodian in its Zurich vault premises and an allocation of the remaining Bullion
constituting the Basket to the Trust Allocated Account maintained by the Custodian in its London vault premises. Likewise, a
Basket redemption order that elects a total loco London delivery will cause the Custodian to effect a de-allocation of
Bullion necessary to satisfy such redemption requests from the Trust Allocated Account maintained by the Custodian in London
to the Trust Unallocated Account maintained by the Custodian in London. A Basket redemption order that elects a loco Zurich
delivery for (i) platinum, (ii) palladium or (iii) platinum and palladium will cause the Custodian to effect a
de-allocation of such platinum or palladium necessary to satisfy such redemption requests from the Trust Allocated Account
maintained by the Zurich Sub-Custodian in Zurich to the Trust Unallocated Account maintained in Zurich and a de-allocation of
the remaining Bullion constituting the Basket necessary to satisfy such redemption requests from the Trust Allocated Account
maintained by the Custodian in London to the Trust Unallocated Account maintained by the Custodian in London. 

23 

In
the event that there is not sufficient platinum or palladium in the Trust Allocated Account in London to satisfy loco London redemptions,
the Custodian shall cause the Zurich Sub-Custodian to de-allocate sufficient platinum or palladium held by it for the Trust Allocated
Account in Zurich and cause a transfer of such platinum or palladium from the Trust Unallocated Account maintained by the Custodian
in Zurich to the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account maintained in London. Likewise, in the event that there is not sufficient
platinum or palladium in the Trust Allocated Account in Zurich to satisfy loco Zurich redemptions, the Custodian will initiate
the reverse procedure to transfer platinum or palladium from London to Zurich. These transfers between London and Zurich unallocated
accounts will generally occur pursuant to loco swap arrangements and will not expose the Authorized Participant or the Trust to
any additional expense. The Custodian has assumed the responsibility and expenses for loco swap transfers and shall bear any risk
of loss related to the platinum or palladium being transferred. If no loco swap counterparty is available, the Custodian shall
arrange, at its own expense and risk, for the physical transportation of platinum or palladium between the Zurich Sub-Custodian s
Zurich vault premises and the Custodian s London vault premises. If such a loco swap or physical transfer is necessary to
effect a loco London or loco Zurich redemption, the settlement of loco London or loco Zurich redemption deliveries may be delayed
more than two, but not more than five, business days. 

The
following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer
to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail. 

Creation
Procedures 

On
any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to create one or more Baskets. Creation and redemption
orders are accepted on business days the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Settlements of such orders requiring
receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of Bullion in the United Kingdom, Zurich or another jurisdiction
will occur on business days when (1) banks in the United Kingdom, Zurich and such other jurisdiction and (2) the
London and Zurich Bullion markets are regularly open for business. If such banks or the London or Zurich Bullion markets are not
open for regular business for a full day, such a day will only be a business day for settlement purposes if the
settlement procedures can be completed by the end of such day. Settlement of orders requiring receipt or delivery, or confirmation
of receipt or delivery, of Shares will occur, after confirmation of the applicable Bullion delivery, on business days 
when the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. In the event of a level 3 market-wide circuit breaker resulting in a trading halt
for the remainder of the trading day, the time of the market-wide trading halt is considered the close of regular trading and
no creation orders for the current trade date will be accepted after that time (the cutoff ). Orders placed after
the cutoff will be deemed to be rejected and will not be processed. Orders should be placed in proper form on the following business
day. Purchase orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. 

By
placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Bullion with the Trust. Prior to the delivery of Baskets
for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for
the purchase order. 

Determination
of required deposits 

The
amount of gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the required deposit is determined by dividing the number of ounces of each
metal held by the Trust by the number of Baskets outstanding, as adjusted for the amount of Bullion constituting estimated accrued
but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust. Fractions of a fine ounce of gold, silver, platinum and palladium smaller than 0.001
of a fine ounce which are included in the deposit amount are disregarded in the foregoing calculation. All questions as to the
composition of a Creation Basket Deposit will be finally determined by the Trustee. The Trustee s determination of the Creation
Basket Deposit shall be final and binding on all persons interested in the Trust. 

24 

Delivery
of required deposits 

An
Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account
with the required Bullion deposit amount by the second business day in London or Zurich, as applicable, following the purchase
order date. Upon receipt of the Bullion deposit amount, the Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized
Participant and the Trustee, will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the Bullion deposit amount
from the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and the Trustee will direct DTC to credit
the number of Baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and
safekeeping of Bullion until such Bullion has been received by the Trust shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.
The Trustee may accept delivery of Bullion by such other means as the Sponsor, from time to time, may determine with the Trustee
to be acceptable for the Trust, provided that the same is disclosed in a prospectus relating to the Trust filed with the SEC pursuant
to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. If Bullion is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to
establish such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts in addition to those described in
this report, as the Sponsor determines to be desirable. 

Acting
on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the Bullion deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated
Account to the Trust Allocated Account by transferring gold and silver bars from its inventory and platinum and palladium plates
and ingots from its inventory or the inventory of the Zurich Sub-Custodian to the Trust Allocated Account. The Custodian uses
commercially reasonable efforts to complete the transfer of Bullion to the Trust Allocated Account prior to the time by which
the Trustee is to credit the Basket to the Authorized Participant s DTC account; if, however, such transfers have not been
completed by such time, the number of Baskets ordered will be delivered against receipt of the Bullion deposit amount in the Trust
Unallocated Account, and all Shareholders will be exposed to the risks of unallocated Bullion to the extent of that Bullion deposit
amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process or a Zurich Sub-Custodian completes the allocation process for the
Custodian. See Risk Factors Bullion held in the Trust s unallocated Bullion account and any Authorized Participant s
unallocated Bullion account will not be segregated from the Custodian s assets.... 

Because
gold and silver are allocated only in multiples of whole bars and platinum and palladium are only allocated in multiples of whole
plates or ingots, the amount of Bullion allocated from the Trust Unallocated Account to the Trust Allocated Account may be less
than the total fine ounces of Bullion credited to the Trust Unallocated Account. Any balance will be held in the Trust Unallocated
Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of Bullion held in the Trust Unallocated Account;
no more than 430 troy ounces of gold (maximum weight to make one London Good Delivery Bar), no more than 1,100 troy ounces of
silver (maximum weight to make one Silver Good Delivery Bar), no more than 192.904 troy ounces of platinum (maximum weight to
make one Good Delivery Platinum Plate or Ingot) and no more than 192.904 troy ounces of palladium (maximum weight to make one
Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot) is expected to be held in the Trust Unallocated Account at the close of each business
day. 

Rejection
of purchase orders 

The
Trustee may reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if such order or Creation Basket Deposit is not presented in
proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of counsel,
might be unlawful. None of the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or
Creation Basket Deposit. 

Redemption
Procedures 

The
procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets will mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets.
On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders
must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. In the event of a level
3 market-wide circuit breaker resulting in a trading halt for the remainder of the trading day, the time of the market-wide trading
halt is considered the close of regular trading and no redemption orders for the current trade date will be accepted after that
time (the cutoff ). Orders placed after the cutoff will be deemed to be rejected and will not be processed. Orders
should be placed in proper form on the following business day. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received
in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets and do not entitle
an individual Shareholder to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Basket, or to redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized
Participant. 

25 

By
placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book entry
system to the Trust not later than the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the
delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee
the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 

Determination
of redemption distribution 

The
redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, representing the amount of the Bullion (in the specified proportion of
gold, silver, platinum and palladium) held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed. Fractions of a fine ounce of Bullion
included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption distributions will be subject
to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. 

Delivery
of redemption distribution 

The
redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following
a loco Zurich redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on such second business day, the Trustee s DTC account
has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. The redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized
Participant on or before the fifth business day following a loco London redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time
on the second business day after the loco London redemption order date, the Trustee s DTC account has been credited with
the Baskets to be redeemed. If a loco swap or physical transfer is necessary to effect a loco London or loco Zurich redemption,
the redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on or before the fifth business
day following such a loco London or loco Zurich redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day
after the loco London or loco Zurich redemption order date, the Trustee s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets
to be redeemed. In the event that, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day following the order date of a redemption
order, the Trustee s DTC account has not been credited with the total number of Shares corresponding to the total number
of Baskets to be redeemed pursuant to such redemption order, the Trustee shall send to the Authorized Participant and the Custodian
via fax or electronic mail message notice of such fact and the Authorized Participant shall have two business days following receipt
of such notice to correct such failure. If such failure is not cured within such two business day period, the Trustee (in consultation
with the Sponsor) will cancel such redemption order and will send via fax or electronic mail message notice of such cancellation
to the Authorized Participant and the Custodian, and the Authorized Participant will be solely responsible for all costs incurred
by the Trust, the Trustee or the Custodian related to the cancelled order. The Trustee is also authorized to deliver the redemption
distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Trustee s DTC account by 10:00 a.m.
New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized
its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book entry system on such terms as the Sponsor and the Trustee may from
time to time agree upon. 

The
Custodian transfers the redemption Bullion amount from the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and, thereafter,
to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account. The Authorized Participant and the
Trust are each at risk in respect of Bullion credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodian s
insolvency. See Risk Factors Bullion held in the Trust s unallocated Bullion account and any Authorized Participant s
unallocated Bullion account is not segregated from the Custodian s assets.... 

As
with the allocation of Bullion to the Trust Allocated Account which occurs upon a purchase order, if in transferring Bullion from
the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account in connection with a redemption order there is an excess amount of
Bullion transferred to the Trust Unallocated Account, the excess over the Bullion redemption amount will be held in the Trust
Unallocated Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of Bullion held in the Trust Unallocated
Account; no more than 430 ounces of gold (maximum weight to make one London Good Delivery Bar), no more than 1,100 ounces of silver
(maximum weight to make one Silver Good Delivery Bar), no more than 192 ounces of platinum (maximum weight to make one Good Delivery
Platinum Plate or Ingot) and no more than 192 ounces of palladium (maximum weight to make one Good Delivery Palladium Plate or
Ingot) is expected to be held in the Trust Unallocated Account at the close of each business day. 

26 

Suspension
or rejection of redemption orders 

The
Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption
settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or
trading on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted or (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which
delivery, disposal or evaluation of Bullion is not reasonably practicable. None of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Custodian are
liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 

The
Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement
or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, 

 might
be unlawful. 

Creation
and Redemption Transaction Fe e 

To
compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required
to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of 500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets.
The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. From time to
time, the Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, may waive all or a portion of the applicable transaction fee. The Trustee
shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption
of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice. 

The
Sponsor 

The
Trust's Sponsor is abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC (known as Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC prior to March 1, 2022 and
ETF Securities USA LLC prior to October 1, 2018), a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 17, 2009. 

The
Sponsor s office is located at c/o abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC, 1900 Market Street, Suite 200, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Prior
to April 27, 2018, the Sponsor was wholly-owned by ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. Effective
April 27, 2018, ETF Securities Limited sold its membership interest in the Sponsor to abrdn Inc. (known as Aberdeen Standard Investments
Inc. prior to January 1, 2022), a Delaware corporation. As a result of the sale, abrdn Inc. became the sole member of the Sponsor.
abrdn Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of abrdn plc, which together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, is collectively
referred to as abrdn. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor,
the sole member of the Sponsor, abrdn Inc., is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely
by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor. 

The
Sponsor s Role 

The
Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust, the ongoing registration of the Shares for their public offering in the United
States and the listing of the Shares on the NYSE Arca. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing
expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the
reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing
and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust s
organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 

The
Sponsor does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or the Custodian. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint
a successor Trustee (i) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital,
surplus and undivided profits of at least 150 million), (ii) if, having received written notice of a material breach of its obligations
under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (iii) if the Trustee refuses to consent to
the implementation of an amendment to the Trust s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Sponsor also has
the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is
not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third
anniversary thereafter. The Sponsor also has the right to approve any new or additional custodian that the Trustee may wish to
appoint and any new or additional Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian may wish to appoint. 

27 

The
Sponsor or one of its affiliates or agents (1) develops a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis, (2) prepares marketing
materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trust s website and (3) executes the marketing plan for the
Trust. 

The
Trustee 

The
Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers BNYM ),
serves as the Trustee. BNYM has a trust office at 2 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, New York 11217. BNYM is subject to supervision by
the New York State Financial Services Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Information regarding
creation and redemption Basket composition, NAV of the Trust, transaction fees and the names of the parties that have each executed
an Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained from BNYM. A copy of the Trust Agreement is available for inspection at BNYM s
trust office identified above. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is required to have capital, surplus and undivided profits
of at least 150 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Trustee was in compliance with these conditions. 

The
Trustee s Role 

The
Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust s operational
records. The Trustee s principal responsibilities include (1) transferring the Trust s Bullion as needed to pay the
Sponsor s Fee in Bullion (Bullion transfers are expected to occur approximately monthly in the ordinary course), (2)
valuing the Trust s Bullion and calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share, (3) receiving and processing
orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian
and DTC, (4) selling the Trust s Bullion as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are not assumed by
the Sponsor, (5) when appropriate, making distributions of cash or other property to Shareholders, and (6) receiving and reviewing
reports from or on the Custodian s custody of and transactions in the Trust s Bullion. The Trustee shall, with respect
to directing the Custodian, act in accordance with the instructions of the Sponsor. If the Custodian resigns, the Trustee shall
appoint an additional or replacement Custodian selected by the Sponsor. 

The
Trustee intends to regularly communicate with the Sponsor to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Trustee does not
monitor the performance of the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian other than to review the reports
provided by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements. The Trustee, along with the Sponsor, will liaise with the Trust s
legal, accounting and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee will assist and support the Sponsor with the
preparation of all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust. 

The
Trustee s monthly fees and out-of-pocket expenses are paid by the Sponsor. 

Affiliates
of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold, silver, platinum and palladium 
or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.
Affiliates of the Trustee are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants. 

28 

The
Custodian 

JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan serves as the Custodian of the Trust s Bullion. JPMorgan is a national banking
association organized under the laws of the United States of America. JPMorgan is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. JPMorgan s London office is regulated by the FCA and is
located at 25 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Co.
While the United Kingdom operations of the Custodian are regulated by the FCA, the custodial services provided by the Custodian
and any sub-custodian, including the Zurich Sub-Custodian under the Custody Agreements, are presently not a regulated activity
subject to the supervision and rules of the FCA. The Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian currently uses is UBS AG, which is
located at 45 Bahnhofstrasse, 8001 Zurich, Switzerland. 

The
Custodian s Role 

The
Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust s Bullion deposited with it by Authorized Participants in connection
with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian is also responsible for selecting the Zurich Sub-Custodians and its other sub-custodians,
if any. The Custodian facilitates the transfer of Bullion in and out of the Trust through the unallocated Bullion accounts it
will maintain for each Authorized Participant and the unallocated and allocated Bullion accounts it will maintain for the Trust.
The Custodian holds at its London, England vault premises that portion of the Trust s allocated Bullion to be held in London.
The Zurich Sub-Custodian holds at its Zurich, Switzerland vault premises that portion of the Trust s allocated platinum
and palladium to be held in Zurich on behalf of the Custodian. The Custodian is responsible for allocating specific bars of physical
gold and silver and specific plates or ingots of physical platinum and palladium to the Trust s allocated Bullion account.
The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the Bullion transfers in and out of the Trust s unallocated
and allocated Bullion accounts and identifying the gold and silver bars and the platinum and palladium plates or ingots held in
the Trust s allocated Bullion account. 

The
Custodian s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor. 

The
Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell Bullion or Shares for their
own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Custodian and its
affiliates are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants. 

Inspection
of Bullion 

Under
the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust's auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit the
premises of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust's Bullion and certain related records
maintained by the Custodian. Under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed to procure similar inspection rights
from the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Visits by auditors and inspectors to the Zurich Sub-Custodian's facilities will be arranged through
the Custodian. Other than with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises
of any sub-custodian for the purposes of examining the Trust's Bullion or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no
sub-custodian is obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures,
records or creditworthiness of such sub-custodian. 

The
Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian, in order to examine the Bullion and the records
maintained by them. Inspections were conducted by Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd, a leading commodity inspection and testing
company retained by the Sponsor, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 

There
can be no guarantee that the Sponsor or the Trust's auditors and inspectors will be able to perform physical inspections of the
Trust's Bullion as planned. Local policies, regulations, or ordinances, as well as polices or restrictions adopted by the Custodian
or a sub-custodian, may temporarily prevent, or otherwise impair the ability of, the Sponsor or the Trust's auditors and inspectors,
from performing a physical inspection of the Trust's Bullion on a desired date. In those situations, the Sponsor or the Trust's
auditors and inspectors may seek to verify the Bullion held by the Trust by alternate means, including through virtual inspections
of the Trust's Bullion and/or a review of pertinent records.

Description
of the Shares 

General 

The
Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Trustee creates Shares
only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares) and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The Shares represent
units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance
of Shares above the amount registered on the Trust s then-current and effective registration statement with the SEC will
require the registration of such additional Shares. 

Description
of Limited Rights 

The
Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to shares of a corporation operating
a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated
with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative 
actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable
and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. The Shares
do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights
to distributions. 

Distributions 

If
the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction
of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges
and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee
for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 

Voting
and Approvals 

Under
the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The Trustee may terminate the Trust
upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 75 of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust
Agreement require advance notice to the Shareholders before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no Shareholder vote or approval
is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement. 

Redemption
of the Shares 

The
Shares may only be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant and only in Baskets. 

Book-Entry
Form 

Individual
certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates is deposited by the Trustee with DTC
and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding
at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies (DTC Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC
Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the
Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC.
Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their
Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares.
Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 

30 

Custody
of the Trust s Bullion 

Custody
of the physical gold and silver deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults
and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis. Custody of the physical platinum and palladium deposited with and held by the
Trust is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults and by the Zurich Sub-Custodians selected by the Custodian in
their Zurich, Switzerland vaults and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and
approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA and the LPPM. 

The
Custodian is the custodian of the physical Bullion credited to the Trust Allocated Account in accordance with the Custody Agreements.
The Custodian segregates the physical Bullion credited to the Trust Allocated Account from any other precious metal it holds or
holds for others by entering appropriate entries in its books and records, and requires each Zurich Sub-Custodian to also segregate
the physical platinum and palladium of the Trust that it holds from the other platinum and palladium held by it for other customers
of the Custodian and such Zurich Sub-Custodian s other customers. The Custodian requires each Zurich Sub-Custodian to identify
in its books and records the Trust as having the rights to the physical platinum and palladium credited to its Trust Allocated
Account. Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may inspect the
vaults of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. See Inspection of Bullion . 

The
Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of Bullion
in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions specified in the Custody Agreements, the Custodian allocates Bullion deposited
in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting bars of gold or silver or plates or ingots of platinum or palladium for deposit
to the Trust Allocated Account or, with respect to platinum or palladium to be held in Zurich, require the Zurich Sub-Custodians
to allocate platinum or palladium deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting plates or ingots of platinum or palladium
for deposit for the benefit of the Trust Allocated Amount. All physical gold and silver allocated to the Trust must conform to
the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA. All physical platinum and palladium allocated to the Trust must conform
to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LPPM. The Custodian must replace any non-conforming Bullion with conforming
Bullion as soon as practical upon a determination by the Custodian any Bullion is non-conforming 

The
process of withdrawing Bullion from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket follows the same general procedure as for depositing Bullion
with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. Each transfer of Bullion between the Trust Allocated Account
and the Trust Unallocated Account connected with a creation or redemption of a Basket may result in a small amount of Bullion
being held in the Trust Unallocated Account after the completion of the transfer. In making deposits and withdrawals between the
Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the amounts of gold, silver, platinum and palladium held in the Trust Unallocated Account as of the close of each business
day. See Creation and Redemption of Shares. 

United
States Federal Income Tax Consequences 

The
following discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences generally applies to the purchase, ownership and disposition
of Shares by a US Shareholder (as defined below) and certain US federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in
Shares by a Non-US Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as
amended (the Code ). The discussion below is based on the Code, United States Treasury Regulations Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the
date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of
Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders,
banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, Shareholders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not
discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as capital assets 
within the meaning of Code section 1221 and not as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale
transaction. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law or any transfer tax
on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal, state, local
and foreign tax law or any transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares. 

31 

For
purposes of this discussion, a US Shareholder is a Shareholder that is: 

An
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

A
corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 

An
estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 

A
trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one
or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

A
Shareholder that is not a US Shareholder as defined above (other than a partnership, or an entity treated as a partnership for
US federal tax purposes) generally is considered a Non-US Shareholder for purposes of this discussion. For US federal
income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a
partnership for US federal income tax purposes, generally depends upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the
partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the US federal income tax consequences
of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares. 

Taxation
of the Trust 

The
Trust is classified as a grantor trust for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not
subject to US federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses flow through to the Shareholders,
and the Trustee reports the Trust s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service IRS on that basis. 

Taxation
of US Shareholders 

Shareholders
generally are treated, for US federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets
held by the Trust. Shareholders are also treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata share of the Trust s
income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata share of the Trust s expenses. In the case of
a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the Trust at the
time it acquires its Shares is equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares
as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of Bullion to the Trust in exchange for the Shares is not a taxable event
to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder s tax basis and holding period for the Shares are the same as its tax basis and
holding period for the Bullion delivered in exchange therefore (except to the extent of any cash contributed for such Shares).
For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the
same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares,
should consult their tax advisors. 

When
the Trust sells or transfers precious metal, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss
in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon
the sale or transfer and (2) the Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the precious metal that was sold or transferred.
Such gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder has a
holding period in its Shares of longer than one year. A Shareholder s tax basis for its share of any precious metal sold
by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder s total basis for its Shares immediately prior
to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of precious metal sold, and the denominator of which is the total
amount of the precious metal held by the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder s tax basis
for its pro rata share of the Bullion remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its Shares immediately prior to
the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the precious metal that was sold. 

32 

Upon
a Shareholder s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold a pro rata share of the precious
metal held in the Trust at the time of the sale. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize a gain or loss on
the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the
Shareholder s tax basis for the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 

A
redemption of some or all of a Shareholder s Shares in exchange for the underlying precious metal represented by the
Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder s tax basis for the precious
metal received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder s tax basis for the Shares redeemed. The
Shareholder s holding period with respect to the Bullion received should include the period during which the Shareholder
held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the precious metal received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 

An
Authorized Participant and other investors may be able to re-invest, on a tax-deferred basis, in-kind redemption proceeds received
from exchange-traded products that are substantially similar to the Trust in the Trust s Shares. Authorized Participants
and other investors should consult their tax advisors as to whether and under what circumstances the reinvestment in the Shares
of proceeds from substantially similar exchange-traded products can be accomplished on a tax-deferred basis. 

Under
current law, gains recognized by individuals, estates or trusts from the sale of collectibles, including physical
Bullion, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal income tax rate of 28 , rather than the 20 rate applicable
to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gains recognized by an individual upon the sale of Shares held for
more than one year, or attributable to the Trust s sale of any physical Bullion which the Shareholder is treated (through
its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28 . The tax rates
for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual US Shareholder for one year or less or by a corporate
taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 

In
addition, high-income individuals and certain trusts and estates are subject to a 3.8 Medicare contribution tax that is imposed
on net investment income and gain. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this tax. 

Brokerage
Fees and Trust Expenses 

Any
brokerage or other transaction fees incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares is treated as part of the Shareholder s
tax basis in the Shares. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares reduces the amount realized
by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. 

Shareholders
will be required to recognize a gain or loss upon a sale of Bullion by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or
all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata
share of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are
individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust, to the extent that
such expenses may be deducted, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Miscellaneous itemized deductions, including expenses for
the production of income, will not be deductible for either regular federal income tax or alternative minimum tax purposes for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026 and thereafter generally are (i) deductible only
to the extent that the aggregate of a Shareholder's miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2 of such Shareholder's adjusted
gross income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) not deductible for the purposes of the alternative minimum tax and (iii) are
subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under the Code. 

33 

Investment
by Regulated Investment Companies 

Mutual
funds and other investment vehicles which are regulated investment companies within the meaning of Code section
851 should consult with their tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a security 
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying Bullion for purposes
of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation
of their qualification under Code section 851. In administrative guidance, the IRS stated that it will no longer issue rulings
under Code section 851(b) relating to the determination of whether or not an instrument or position is a security ,
but, instead, intends to defer to guidance from the SEC for such determination. 

United
States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax for US and Non-US Shareholders 

The
Trustee or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provides certain tax-related information
to Shareholders, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding
its allocable portion of the Trust s annual income (if any) and expenses. 

A
US Shareholder may be subject to US backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification
number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-US Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures
to establish that they are not a US person in order to avoid the backup withholding tax. 

The
amount of any backup withholding tax will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder s US federal income tax liability
and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 

Income
Taxation of Non-US Shareholders 

The
Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gains (if any) upon the sale of precious metal. A Non-US Shareholder
generally is not subject to US federal income tax with respect to gains recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares,
or upon the sale of precious metal by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-US Shareholder is an individual and is present in the
United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being
from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-US Shareholder of a trade or
business in the United States. 

Taxation
in Jurisdictions other than the United States 

Prospective
purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their
own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United
States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular,
as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale,
redemption or other dealing. 

ERISA
and Related Considerations 

The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements
on certain employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities,
Keogh plans, and certain commingled investment vehicles or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans
or arrangements are invested (collectively, Plans ), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment
of plan assets of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under other
federal law, or under state or local law Other Law ). 

In
contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should
carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan and the Risk Factors discussed above
and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA or Other Law, including, but not limited
to: (1) whether the investment is permitted under the Plan s governing documents, (2) whether the fiduciary has the authority
to make the investment, (3) whether the investment is consistent with the Plan s funding objectives, (4) the tax effects
of the investment on the Plan, and (5) whether the investment is prudent considering the factors discussed in this report. In
addition, ERISA and Code section 4975 prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons who are parties
in interest under ERISA or disqualified persons under section 4975 of the Code. A violation of these rules
may result in the imposition of significant excise taxes and other liabilities. Plans subject to Other Law may be subject to similar
restrictions. 

34 

It
is anticipated that the Shares will constitute publicly offered securities as defined in the Department of Labor
 Plan Asset Regulations, 2510.3-101 (b)(2) as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA. Accordingly, pursuant to
the Plan Asset Regulations, only Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying assets held in the Trust, should
be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to Other Law should consult legal counsel to determine
whether there would be a similar result under the Other Law. 

Investment
by Certain Retirement Plans 

Code
section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a collectible by an individual retirement account IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section 401(a) Tax Qualified
Account is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom
the Tax Qualified Account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The term
 collectible is defined to include, with certain exceptions, any metal or gem . The IRS has issued several
private letter rulings to the effect that a purchase by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code section 401(a)
plan, of publicly-traded shares in a trust holding precious metals will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution
to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant under Code section 408(m). However the private letter rulings provide that,
if any of the Shares so purchased are distributed from the IRA or Tax Qualified Account to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account
participant, or if any precious metal is received by such IRA or Tax Qualified Account upon the redemption of any of the
Shares purchased by it, the Shares or precious metal so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year of
distribution, to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. Accordingly, potential
IRA or Tax Qualified Account investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the treatment of an
investment in Shares under Code section 408(m). 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Shareholders
should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. Shareholders should also refer to the
other information included in this report, including the Trust s financial statements and the related notes. 

RISKS
RELATED TO BULLION 

The
price of Bullion may be affected by the sale of ETVs tracking the gold, palladium, platinum and silver markets. 

To
the extent existing exchange traded vehicles ETVs tracking the gold, palladium, platinum and silver markets represent
a significant proportion of demand for physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium, large redemptions of the securities of these
ETVs could negatively affect physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices and the price and NAV of the Shares. 

Crises
may motivate large-scale sales of gold, palladium, platinum and silver which could decrease the price of Bullion and adversely
affect an investment in the Shares. 

The
possibility of large-scale distress sales of Bullion in times of crisis may have a short-term negative impact on the price of
Bullion and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. For example, the 2008 financial credit crisis resulted in significantly
depressed prices of gold, silver, platinum and palladium largely due to forced sales and deleveraging from institutional investors.
Crises in the future may impair Bullion s price performance which would, in turn, adversely affect an investment in the
Shares. 

35 

Several
factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of Bullion and a corresponding decline in the price of Shares.
Among them: 

A significant increase in Bullion hedging activity by Bullion producers. Should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity
of Bullion producing companies, it could cause a decline in world Bullion prices, adversely affecting the price of the Shares. 

A significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards Bullion. Should the speculative community take a negative
view towards any Bullion metals, it could cause a decline in world prices for such Bullion metals, negatively impacting the price
of the Shares. 

A widening of interest rate differentials between the cost of money and the cost of Bullion could negatively affect the price
of Bullion which, in turn, could negatively affect the price of the Shares. 

A combination of rising money interest rates and a continuation of the current low cost of borrowing Bullion could improve the
economics of selling Bullion forward. This could result in an increase in hedging by Bullion mining companies and short selling
by speculative interests, which would negatively affect the price of Bullion. Under such circumstances, the price of the Shares
would be similarly affected. 

Conversely,
several factors may trigger a temporary increase in the price of Bullion prior to your investment in the Shares. For example,
sudden increased investor interest in silver may cause an increase in world silver prices, increasing the price of the Shares.
If that is the case, you will be buying Shares at prices affected by the temporarily high prices of silver, and you may incur
losses when the causes for the temporary increase disappear. 

A
decline in the automobile industry may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of platinum and palladium and a corresponding
decline in the price of Shares. 

Autocatalysts,
automobile components for emissions control that use platinum and palladium, accounted for approximately 35 of the gross global
demand in platinum and 83 of the gross global demand in palladium in 2021. Reduced automotive industry sales or a shift from
gasoline-powered to electric vehicles may result in a decline in autocatalyst demand. A contraction in the global automotive industry
or more widespread acceptance of electric vehicles may impact the price of platinum and palladium and affect the price of the
Shares. 

The
value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the Bullion held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of gold, silver,
platinum or palladium could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The
Shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium
in the proportions held by the Trust, and the value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the Bullion held by the Trust,
less the Trust s liabilities (including estimated accrued but unpaid expenses). The prices of physical gold, silver, platinum
and palladium have fluctuated widely over the past several years. Several factors may affect the price of these metals, including: 

A
 change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the price of Bullion. Bullion is used in a wide range
 of industrial applications, and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, consequently, its price
 and the price of the Shares; 

Investors 
 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; 

Currency
 exchange rates; 

Interest
 rates; 

Investment
 and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; 

Global
 or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and 

Global
 Bullion supply and demand. 

36 

In
addition, investors should be aware that there is no assurance that gold, silver, platinum or palladium will maintain their long-term
value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of any metal held by the Trust declines, the Sponsor
expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately to the Trust s interest in such metal. 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE SHARES 

The
sale of the Trust s Bullion to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor at a time of low Bullion prices could adversely affect
the value of the Shares. 

The
Trustee sells Bullion held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor on an as-needed basis irrespective
of then-current gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices. The Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to
buy or sell Bullion to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of Bullion. Consequently, the
Trust s Bullion may be sold at a time when the Bullion price is low, resulting in a negative effect on the value of the
Shares. 

The
value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor or the Trustee under the
Trust Agreement. 

Under
the Trust Agreement, each of the Sponsor and the Trustee has a right to be indemnified from the Trust for any liability or expense
it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance or reckless disregard on its part. That
means the Sponsor or the Trustee may require the assets of the Trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered
by it. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the Trust and the value of the Shares. 

The
Shares may trade at a price which is at, above or below the NAV per Share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative
to the NAV per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and London, Zurich and COMEX. 

The
Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV per Share. The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust s
assets. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share as well as market supply and
demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent
trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the major Bullion markets. While the Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m.
New York time, liquidity in the market for gold, platinum and palladium will be reduced after the close of the major world markets
for gold, platinum and palladium, including London, Zurich and the COMEX and liquidity in the market for silver will be reduced
after the close of the major world silver markets, including London and the COMEX. As a result, during these periods, trading
spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares may widen. 

A
possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand of Shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price
volatility in the Shares. 

Investors
may purchase Shares to hedge existing exposure to Bullion or to speculate on the price of Bullion. Speculation on the price of
Bullion may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Shares available for
purchase (for example, in the event that large redemption requests by Authorized Participants dramatically affect Share liquidity),
investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase Shares for delivery to Share lenders. Those repurchases
may in turn, dramatically increase the price of the Shares until additional Shares are created through the creation process. This
is often referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in Shares that are
not directly correlated to the price of Bullion. 

Purchasing
activity in the platinum and palladium markets associated with Basket creations or selling activity following Basket redemptions
may affect the prices of platinum and palladium and Share trading prices. These price changes may adversely affect an investment
in the Shares. 

Purchasing
activity associated with acquiring the Bullion required for deposit into the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets
may increase the market prices of platinum and palladium, which will result in higher prices for the Shares. Increases in the
market prices of platinum and palladium may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants. Other
market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market prices of platinum and palladium that may result from
increased purchasing activity of platinum and palladium connected with the issuance of Baskets. If the prices of platinum and
palladium decline, the trading price of the Shares will also decline. 

37 

Selling
activity associated with sales of platinum and palladium withdrawn from the Trust in connection with the redemption of Baskets
may decrease the market price of platinum and palladium, which will result in lower prices for the Shares. Decreases in the market
price of platinum and palladium may also occur as a result of the selling activity of other market participants. If the price
of platinum and palladium declines, the trading price of the Shares will also decline. 

Since
there is no limit on the amount of platinum and palladium that the Trust may acquire, the Trust, as it grows, may have an impact
on the supply and demand of platinum and palladium that ultimately may affect the price of the Shares in a manner unrelated to
other factors affecting the global markets for platinum and palladium. 

The
Trust Agreement places no limit on the amount of platinum and palladium the Trust may hold. Moreover, the Trust may issue an unlimited
number of Shares, subject to registration requirements, and thereby acquire an unlimited amount of platinum and palladium. The
global market for platinum and palladium is characterized by supply and demand constraints that are generally not present in the
markets for other precious metals such as gold and silver. Between 2015 and 2019, world platinum mine supply averaged 6.1 million
ounces and world palladium mine supply averaged 7 million ounces. During the same period, total gross global demand measured 8
million ounces of platinum and 10.1 million ounces of palladium. If the amount of platinum and palladium acquired by the Trust
is large enough in relation to global platinum and palladium supply and demand, further in-kind creations and redemptions of Shares
could have an impact on the supply and demand of platinum and palladium unrelated to other factors affecting the global markets
for platinum and palladium. Such an impact could affect the prices for platinum and palladium that would directly affect the price
at which Shares are traded on the Exchange or the price of future Baskets created or redeemed by the Trust. The Trust and
the Sponsor cannot provide Shareholders any assurance that the metal holdings of the Trust will have a similar impact or have
no long-term metal price impact thereby affecting Share trading prices. 

The
Shares and their value could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise. 

There
may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the Trust s operations and the trading of the Shares
that could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Shares. In addition, although the Trust is not actively managed 
by traditional methods, to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise, the Sponsor s
past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving these problems or issues. 

Discrepancies,
disruptions or unreliability of the LBMA PM Gold Price, the LBMA Silver Price, or the LME PM Fix could impact the value of the
Trust s Bullion and the market price of the Shares. 

The
Trustee values the Trust s gold, silver, platinum and palladium pursuant to the LBMA PM Gold Price for gold, the LBMA Silver
Price for silver, and the LME PM Fix for platinum and palladium. In the event that the LBMA PM Gold Price, the LBMA Silver Price,
or the LME PM Fix (the London Metal Prices prove to be inaccurate benchmarks, or such London Metal Prices vary
materially from the prices determined by other mechanisms for valuing precious metals, the value of the Trust s Bullion
and the market price of the Shares could be adversely impacted. Any future developments in the London Metal Prices, to the extent
they have a material impact on the London Metal Prices, could adversely impact the value of the Trust s Bullion and the
market price of the Shares. It is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events may occur that could result
in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the benchmarks to produce, the London Metal Prices on any given date. Furthermore,
any actual or perceived disruptions that result in the perception that the London Metal Prices are vulnerable to actual or attempted
manipulation could adversely affect the behavior of market participants, which may have an effect on the prices of gold, silver,
platinum or palladium. If the London Metal Prices are unreliable for any reason, the prices of gold, silver, platinum and palladium
and the market price for the Shares may decline or be subject to greater volatility. 

38 

If
the process of creation and redemption of Baskets encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactions
intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the prices of the underlying Bullion may not exist and, as a result,
the price of the Shares may fall. 

If
the processes of creation and redemption of Shares (which depend on timely transfers of Bullion to and by the Custodian) encounter
any unanticipated difficulties, including, but not limited to, the Trust s inability in the future to obtain regulatory
approvals for the offer and sale of additional Shares after its present offering is completed, potential market participants who
would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies
between the price of the Shares and the prices of the underlying Bullion may not take the risk that, as a result of those difficulties,
they may not be able to realize the profit they expect. If this is the case, the liquidity of Shares may decline and the price
of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the prices of the underlying Bullion and may fall. Additionally, redemptions could
be suspended in any period during which (1) the NYSE Arca is closed (other than customary weekend or holiday closings) or trading
on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, or (2) an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation
of the Bullion is not reasonably practicable. 

The
liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal from participation of one or more Authorized Participants. 

In
the event that one or more Authorized Participants having substantial interests in Shares or otherwise responsible for a significant
portion of the Shares daily trading volume on the Exchange withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will
likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares and result in Shareholders incurring a loss on their
investment. 

Shareholders
do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or the protections afforded by the Commodity Exchange Act CEA ). 

The
Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under
such act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies.
The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, commodity interests or any other instruments
regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC and the National Futures Association NFA ). Furthermore, the Trust
is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not commodity interests , and neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection
with the Trust or the Shares. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated
instruments or commodity pools operated by registered commodity pool operators or advised by registered commodity trading
advisors. 

The
Trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders. 

If
the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time which is disadvantageous
to Shareholders, such as when Bullion prices are lower than the Bullion prices at the time when Shareholders purchased
their Shares. In such a case, when the Trust s Bullion is sold as part of the Trust s liquidation, the resulting
proceeds distributed to Shareholders will be less than if Bullion prices were higher at the time of sale. 

The
lack of an active market for the Shares may limit the ability of Shareholders to sell the Shares. 

Although
Shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, it cannot be assumed that an active trading market for the Shares will be maintained.
If an investor needs to sell Shares at a time when no active market for Shares exists, such lack of an active market will most
likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the Shares (assuming the investor is able to sell them). 

Shareholders
do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles. 

As
interests in an investment trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares
of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). In
addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors
or approve amendments to the Trust Agreement and do not receive dividends). 

39 

An
investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in Bullion. 

The
Trust competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold,
silver, platinum and palladium industries and other securities backed by or linked to Bullion, direct investments in Bullion
and investment vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor s
control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in Bullion directly, which could
limit the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares. 

The
amount of Bullion represented by each Share will decrease over the life of the Trust due to the recurring deliveries of Bullion
necessary to pay the Sponsor s Fee in-kind and potential sales of Bullion to pay in cash the Trust expenses not assumed
by the Sponsor. Without increases in the price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium sufficient to compensate for that
decrease, the price of the Shares will also decline proportionately over the life of the Trust. 

The
amount of Bullion represented by each Share decreases each day by the Sponsor s Fee. In addition, although the Sponsor
has agreed to assume all organizational and certain administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust (the Trustee's
monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian's fee and reimbursement of the Custodian's expenses under the Custody Agreements,
Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses),
in exceptional cases certain Trust expenses may need to be paid by the Trust. Because the Trust does not have any income, it must
either make payments in-kind by deliveries of Bullion (as is the case with the Sponsor s Fee) or it must sell Bullion
to obtain cash (as in the case of any exceptional expenses). The result of these sales of Bullion and recurring deliveries
of Bullion to pay the Sponsor s Fee in-kind is a decrease in the amount of Bullion represented by each Share.
New deposits of Bullion, received in exchange for new Shares issued by the Trust, will not reverse this trend. 

A
decrease in the amount of Bullion represented by each Share results in a decrease in each Share s price even if the
price of gold, palladium, platinum and silver does not change. To retain the Share s original price, the price
of gold, silver, platinum and palladium must increase. Without that increase, the lesser amount of gold, silver, platinum
and palladium represented by the Share will have a correspondingly lower price. If this increase does not occur, or is not sufficient
to counter the lesser amount of Bullion represented by each Share, Shareholders will sustain losses on their investment in
Shares. 

An
increase in Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or the existence of unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust, will require
the Trustee to sell larger amounts of Bullion, and will result in a more rapid decrease of the amount of Bullion represented
by each Share and a corresponding decrease in its value. 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE CUSTODY OF BULLION 

The
Trust s Bullion may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access. 

There
is a risk that part or all of the Trust s Bullion could be lost, damaged or stolen. Access to the Trust s Bullion
could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these
events may adversely affect the operations of the Trust and, consequently, an investment in the Shares. 

40 

The
Trust s lack of insurance protection and the Shareholders limited rights of legal recourse against the Trust, the
Trustee, the Sponsor, the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian and any other sub-custodian exposes the Trust and its Shareholders
to the risk of loss of the Trust s Bullion for which no person is liable. 

The
Trust does not insure its Bullion. The Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions
as it considers appropriate in connection with its custodial obligations and is responsible for all costs, fees and expenses arising
from the insurance policy or policies. The Trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate
the existence, nature or amount of coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance
or any insurance with respect to the Bullion held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. In addition, the Custodian and
the Trustee do not require the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other direct or indirect sub-custodians to be insured or bonded with
respect to their custodial activities or in respect of the Bullion held by them on behalf of the Trust. Further, Shareholders 
recourse against the Trust, the Trustee and the Sponsor under New York law, the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian and any other
sub-custodian under English law, and any other sub-custodian under the law governing their custody operations is limited. Consequently,
a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trust s Bullion which is not covered by insurance and for which no person
is liable in damages. 

The
Custodian s limited liability under the Custody Agreements and English law may impair the ability of the Trust to recover
losses concerning its Bullion and any recovery may be limited, even in the event of fraud, to the market value of the Bullion
at the time the fraud is discovered. 

The
liability of the Custodian is limited under the Custody Agreements. Under the Custody Agreements between the Trustee and the Custodian
which establish the Trust s unallocated Bullion account Unallocated Account and the Trust s allocated Bullion
account Allocated Account ), the Custodian is only liable for losses that are the direct result of its own negligence,
fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. Any such liability is further limited to the market value of the Bullion
lost or damaged at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian provided the Custodian notifies
the Trust and the Trustee promptly after the discovery of the loss or damage. Under each Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion
Account Agreement (between the Custodian and an Authorized Participant establishing an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account),
the Custodian is not contractually or otherwise liable for any losses suffered by any Authorized Participant or Shareholder that
are not the direct result of its own gross negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties under such agreement,
and in no event will its liability exceed the market value of the balance in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account at
the time such gross negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian. For any Authorized Participant Unallocated
Bullion Account Agreement between an Authorized Participant and another Bullion clearing bank, the liability of the Bullion clearing
bank to the Authorized Participant may be greater or lesser than the Custodian s liability to the Authorized Participant
described in the preceding sentence, depending on the terms of the agreement. In addition, the Custodian will not be liable for
any delay in performance or any non-performance of any of its obligations under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Unallocated
Account Agreement or the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable
control, including acts of God, war or terrorism. As a result, the recourse of the Trustee or a Shareholder, under English law,
is limited. Furthermore, under English common law, the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian will
not be liable for any delay in the performance or any non-performance of its custodial obligations by reason of any cause beyond
its reasonable control. 

The
obligations of the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian and any other sub-custodians are governed by English law, which may
frustrate the Trust in attempting to seek legal redress against the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other
sub-custodian concerning its Bullion. 

The
obligations of the Custodian under the Custody Agreements are, and the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account
Agreements may be, governed by English law. The Custodian has entered into arrangements with the Zurich Sub-Custodian and may
enter into arrangements with any sub-custodians for the custody or temporary holding of the Trust s Bullion, which
arrangements may also be governed by English law. The Trust is a New York common law trust. Any United States, New York or other
court situated in the United States may have difficulty interpreting English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements,
is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute), LBMA and the LPPM rules or the customs and practices in the London
custody market. It may be difficult or impossible for the Trust to sue the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other sub-custodian
in a United States, New York or other court situated in the United States. In addition, it may be difficult, time consuming and/or
expensive for the Trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a United States, New York or other court situated
in the United States. 

41 

Although
the relationship between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian concerning the Trust s allocated Bullion is expressly
governed by English law, a court hearing any legal dispute concerning their arrangement may disregard that choice of law and apply
Swiss law, in which case the ability of the Trust to seek legal redress against the Zurich Sub-Custodian may be frustrated. 

The
obligations of the Zurich Sub-Custodian under its arrangement with the Custodian with respect to the Trust s allocated gold,
silver, platinum and palladium is expressly governed by English law. Nevertheless, a court in the United States, England or Switzerland
may determine that English law should not apply and, instead, apply Swiss law to that arrangement. Not only might it be difficult
or impossible for a United States or English court to apply Swiss law to the Zurich Sub-Custodian's arrangement, but application
of Swiss law may, among other things, alter the relative rights and obligations of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian
to the extent that a loss to the Trust s Bullion may not have adequate or any legal redress. Further, the ability of
the Trust to seek legal redress against the Zurich Sub-Custodian may be frustrated by application of Swiss law. 

The
Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its Bullion is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed. 

If
the Trust s Bullion is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Trust,
the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trust s claim. For example, as to a
particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust might be limited to the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian
or any other sub-custodian or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of
which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust. 

Shareholders
and Authorized Participants lack the right under the Custody Agreements to assert claims directly against the Custodian, the Zurich
Sub-Custodian, and any other sub-custodian. 

Neither
the Shareholders nor any Authorized Participant have a right under the Custody Agreements to assert a claim of the Trust against
the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian. Claims under the Custody Agreements may only be asserted
by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. 

The
Custodian may be reliant on the Zurich Sub-Custodians for the safekeeping of the Trust s platinum and palladium held in
Zurich on an allocated basis. Furthermore, the Custodian has limited obligations to oversee or monitor the Zurich Sub-Custodians.
As a result, failure by a Zurich Sub-Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s platinum and palladium
could result in a loss to the Trust. 

While
some trading occurs in London, platinum and palladium generally trade on a loco Zurich basis, whereby the physical precious metal
is held in vaults located in Zurich or is transferred into accounts established in Zurich. The Custodian does not have a vault
in Zurich and will be reliant on one or more Zurich Sub-Custodians for the safekeeping of that portion of the Trust s allocated
platinum and palladium that is held in Zurich. Other than obligations to (1) use reasonable care in appointing a Zurich Sub-Custodian,
(2) require the Zurich Sub-Custodians to segregate the platinum and palladium held by it for the Trust from any other platinum
and palladium held by it for the Custodian and any other customers of the Custodian by making appropriate entries in its books
and records and (3) ensure that a Zurich Sub-Custodian provides confirmation to the Trustee that it has undertaken to segregate
the platinum and palladium held by it for the Trust, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions of the Zurich
Sub-Custodians. Other than as described above, the Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by the Zurich Sub-Custodians
of their custody functions. The Trustee s obligation to monitor the performance of the Custodian is limited to receiving
and reviewing the reports of the Custodian. The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Zurich Sub-Custodians or any other
sub-custodian. In addition, the ability of the Trustee and the Sponsor to monitor the performance of the Custodian may be limited
because, under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee and the Sponsor have only limited rights to visit the premises of the Custodian
or a Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s platinum or palladium and certain related records maintained
by the Custodian or the Zurich Sub-Custodians. 

42 

As
a result of the above, any failure by a Zurich Sub-Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s platinum
or palladium may not be detectable or controllable by the Custodian, the Sponsor or the Trustee and could result in a loss to
the Trust. 

Because
the Trustee does not, and the Custodian has limited obligations to, oversee and monitor the activities of sub-custodians who may
hold the Trust s Bullion, failure by the sub-custodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s Bullion
could result in a loss to the Trust. 

Under
the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian may appoint from time to time one or more sub-custodians to hold the Trust s
Bullion on a temporary basis pending delivery to the Custodian. The Custodian currently uses UBS AG for palladium
and platinum. The custodian may use LBMA and LPPM market-making members that provide bullion vaulting
and clearing services to third parties. The Custodian will select the Zurich Sub-Custodians, and each Zurich Sub-Custodian will
custody that portion of the Trust s allocated platinum and palladium to be held in Zurich for the Custodian. The Custodian
is required under the Allocated Account Agreement to use reasonable care in appointing the Zurich Sub-Custodians and any other
sub-custodian, making the Custodian liable only for negligence or bad faith in the selection of such sub-custodians, and has an
obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of the Trust s Bullion from any sub-custodians appointed
by the Custodian. Otherwise, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions of its sub-custodians. These sub-custodians
may in turn appoint further sub-custodians, but the Custodian is not responsible for the appointment of these further sub-custodians.
The Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by sub-custodians of their custody functions or their selection of
further sub-custodians. The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Custodian other than to review the reports provided
by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements and does not undertake to monitor the performance of any sub-custodian. Furthermore,
except for the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes
of examining the Trust s Bullion or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian will be obligated
to cooperate in any review the Trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such
sub-custodian. In addition, the ability of the Trustee to monitor the performance of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian
may be limited because under the Allocated Account Agreement and the Unallocated Account Agreement the Trustee has only limited
rights to visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s Bullion and certain related records
maintained by the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. See Custody of the Trust s Bullion for more
information about sub-custodians that may hold the Trust s bullion. 

The
obligations of any sub-custodian of the Trust s Bullion are not determined by contractual arrangements but by LBMA and LPPM
rules and London or Zurich Bullion market customs and practices, which may prevent the Trust s recovery of damages for losses
on its Bullion custodied with sub-custodians. 

Except
for the Custodian s arrangements with the Zurich Sub-Custodians, there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements
between sub-custodians that hold the Trust s Bullion and the Trustee or the Custodian because traditionally such arrangements
are based on the LBMA s and the LPPM s rules and on the customs and practices of the London or Zurich Bullion markets.
In the event of a legal dispute with respect to or arising from such arrangements, it may be difficult to define such customs
and practices. The LBMA s and the LPPM s rules may be subject to change outside the control of the Trust. Under English
law, neither the Trustee nor the Custodian would have a supportable breach of contract claim against a sub-custodian for losses
relating to the safekeeping of Bullion. If the Trust s Bullion is lost or damaged while in the custody of a sub-custodian,
the Trust may not be able to recover damages from the Custodian or the sub-custodian. Whether a sub-custodian will be liable for
the failure of sub-custodians appointed by it to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s Bullion will depend
on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. Shareholders cannot be assured that the Trustee will be able to recover
damages from sub-custodians whether appointed by the Custodian or by another sub-custodian for any losses relating to the safekeeping
of Bullion by such sub-custodian. 

43 

Physical
Bullion allocated to the Trust in connection with the creation of a Basket may not meet the Good Delivery Standards and, if a
Basket is issued against such Bullion, the Trust may suffer a loss. 

Neither
the Trustee nor the Custodian independently confirms the fineness of the physical gold, silver, platinum or palladium allocated
to the Trust in connection with the creation of a Basket. The Bullion allocated to the Trust by the Custodian may be different
from the reported fineness or weight required by the LBMA s standards for gold and silver bars or the LPPM s standards
for platinum and palladium plates and ingots delivered in settlement of a Bullion trade Good Delivery Standards ),
the standards required by the Trust. If the Trustee nevertheless issues a Basket against such Bullion, and if the Custodian fails
to satisfy its obligation to credit the Trust the amount of any deficiency, the Trust may suffer a loss. 

Bullion
held in the Trust s unallocated Bullion account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated Bullion account will
not be segregated from the Custodian s assets. If the Custodian becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy
a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the Custodian s insolvency, there may be
a delay and costs incurred in identifying the gold and silver bars and platinum and palladium plates and ingots held in the Trust s
allocated Bullion account. 

Bullion
which is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution is held for a time in the Trust Unallocated
Account and, previously or subsequently, in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account of the purchasing or redeeming Authorized
Participant. During those times, the Trust and the Authorized Participant, as the case may be, have no proprietary rights to any
specific bars of gold or silver or plates or ingots of platinum or palladium held by the Custodian and each is an unsecured creditor
of the Custodian with respect to the amount of Bullion held in such unallocated accounts. In addition, if the Custodian fails
to allocate the Trust s Bullion in a timely manner, in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the
Unallocated Account Agreement, or if a sub-custodian fails to so segregate Bullion held by it on behalf of the Trust, unallocated
Bullion will not be segregated from the Custodian s assets, and the Trust will be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian
with respect to the amount so held in the event of the insolvency of the Custodian. In the event the Custodian becomes insolvent,
the Custodian s assets might not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or the Authorized Participant for the amount
of Bullion held in their respective unallocated Bullion accounts. 

In
the case of the insolvency of the Custodian, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the Bullion held in all of the accounts
held by the Custodian, including the Trust Allocated Account. Although the Trust would be able to claim ownership of properly
allocated Bullion, the Trust could incur expenses in connection with asserting such claims, and the assertion of such a claim
by the liquidator could delay creations and redemptions of Baskets. 

In
issuing Baskets, the Trustee relies on certain information received from the Custodian which is subject to confirmation after
the Trustee has relied on the information. If such information turns out to be incorrect, Baskets may be issued in exchange for
an amount of Bullion which is more or less than the amount of Bullion which is required to be deposited with the Trust. 

The
Custodian s definitive records are prepared after the close of its business day. However, when issuing Baskets, the Trustee
relies on information reporting the amount of Bullion credited to the Trust s accounts which it receives from the Custodian
during the business day and which is subject to correction during the preparation of the Custodian s definitive records
after the close of business. If the information relied upon by the Trustee is incorrect, the amount of Bullion actually received
by the Trust may be more or less than the amount required to be deposited for the issuance of Baskets. 

GENERAL
RISKS 

The
Trust relies on the information and technology systems of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Marketing Agent and, to a lesser degree,
the Sponsor, which could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions
which could have a material adverse effect on the Trust s record keeping and operations. 

The
Custodian, the Trustee and the Marketing Agent depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network, hardware
and software systems to conduct their business as it relates to the Trust. A cybersecurity incident, or a failure to protect their
computer systems, networks and information against cybersecurity threats, could result in a loss of information and adversely
impact their ability to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Trust. Despite implementation of network
and other cybersecurity measures, their security measures may not be adequate to protect against all cybersecurity threats. 

44 

War,
a major terrorist attack and other geopolitical events, including but not limited to the war between Russia and Ukraine, outbreaks
or public health emergencies (as declared by the World Health Organization), the continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities,
or a prolonged government shutdown may cause volatility in the price of Bullion due to the importance of a country or region to
the Bullion markets, market access restrictions imposed on some local Bullion producers and refiners, potential impacts to global
transportation and shipping and other supply chain disruptions. These events are unpredictable and may lead to extended periods
of price volatility. 

The
operations of the Trust, the exchanges, brokers and counterparties with which the Trust does business, and the markets in which
the Trust does business, could be severely disrupted in the event of war, a major terrorist attack and other geopolitical events,
including but not limited to, the war between Russia and Ukraine, outbreaks or public health emergencies (as declared by the World
Health Organization), the continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities, or a prolonged government shutdown. Such events
may cause volatility in the price of Bullion due to the importance of a country or region to the Bullion markets, market access
restrictions imposed on some local Bullion producers and refiners, or potential impacts to global transportation, shipping, and
other supply chain disruptions. 

In
late February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other
countries in the region and in the West. The responses of countries and political bodies to Russia's actions, the larger overarching
tensions, and Ukraine's military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally,
have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium and the share price
of the Trust. The conflict in Ukraine, along with global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions,
collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict beyond Ukraine's borders, could disturb the Bullion markets.
Russia is one of the world's largest producers of gold, palladium, platinum and silver. On March 7, 2022, the LBMA suspended its
accreditation of six Russian refiners of gold and silver, and, on April 8, 2022, the LPPM suspended its accreditation of two Russian
refiners of platinum and palladium. The LBMA and LPPM each stated that existing bars produced by the refiners before their suspension
will still be accepted as good delivery. Following an announcement at the G7 Summit to collectively ban the import of Russian
gold, the UK passed regulations which prohibit the direct or indirect (i) import of gold that originated in Russia, (ii) acquisition
of gold that originated in Russia or is located in Russia and (iii) supply or delivery of gold that originated in Russia, all
after July 21, 2022. Similarly, US regulations prohibit the import of gold of Russian origin into the United States on or after
June 28, 2022 and EU regulations prohibit the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of gold if it originates in Russia
and has been exported from Russia after July 22, 2022. War and other geopolitical events in eastern Europe, including but not
limited to Russia and Ukraine, may cause volatility in commodity prices including precious metals prices. These events are unpredictable
and may lead to extended periods of price volatility. 

The
Trust as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of public health crises, including the ongoing
novel coronavirus pandemic. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to economies and markets around the world, including the markets in which the Trust
invests, and which has and may continue to negatively impact the value of certain of the Trust s investments. Although vaccines
for COVID-19 and variants thereof are becoming more widely available, the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts thereof may continue for
an extended period of time and may vary from market to market. To the extent the impacts of COVID-19 continue, the Trust may experience
negative impacts to its business that could exacerbate other risks to which the Trust is subject. Policy and legislative changes
in countries around the world are affecting many aspects of financial regulation, and governmental and quasi-governmental authorities
and regulators throughout the world have previously responded to serious economic disruptions with a variety of significant fiscal
and monetary policy changes.

Potential
conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust. 

Conflicts
of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust and its Shareholders, on the other
hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the Trust
and its Shareholders. As an example, the Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging
in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust.

Introduction. 

The
abrdn Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust (the Trust is a trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The
Trust does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee acting as trustee pursuant to the Depositary Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement between the Trustee and abrdn
ETFs Sponsor LLC the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). The Trust issues shares Shares representing
fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist of gold, silver, platinum and palladium
bullion Bullion held by a custodian as an agent of the Trust and responsible only to the Trustee. 

The
Trust is a passive investment vehicle and the objective of the Trust is for the value of each Share to approximately reflect,
at any given time, the price of the Bullion owned by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (anticipated to be principally
for accrued operating expenses), divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed
to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of Bullion. 

The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for Bullion, only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares or integral multiples thereof
(each, a Basket ), and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers, or other securities market participants
not required to register as broker-dealers, such as a bank or other financial institution, that (1) are participants in DTC and
(2) have previously entered into an agreement with the Trust governing the terms and conditions of such issuance (such dealers,
the Authorized Participants ). As of the date of this annual report the Authorized Participants that have signed
an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trust are Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas, LLC.

Investing
in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The following table illustrates the
movement in the NAV of the Shares against the price per ounce of gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the proportions held
by the Trust (the Proportionate Price since inception. 

NAV per Share vs. Proportionate Price from October 18, 2010
(the Date of Inception) to December 31, 2022 

The
divergence of the NAV per Share from the Proportionate Price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the Trust expenses that
arise if an investment had been held since inception. 

Critical
Accounting Policy 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s
financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting
policies. Below we describe the valuation of Bullion, a critical accounting policy that we believe is important to understanding
the results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of our accounting policies. 

Valuation
of Bullion 

The
Trust s Bullion is recorded, per individual metal type, at fair value. The cost of Bullion is determined according to the
average cost method and the fair value is based on the relevant London Metal Price for each metal held
by the Trust. The cost of gold is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the
LBMA PM Gold Price. For silver this is the LBMA Silver Price as established by the seven LBMA authorised bullion banks. For platinum
and palladium this is the LME PM Fix for platinum or palladium (as applicable) of the price of an ounce of such
metal performed in London, England by fixing members of the LPPM. Realized gains and losses on transfers of Bullion, or Bullion
distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost
of Bullion transferred. 

Once
the value of Bullion has been determined, the NAV is computed by the Trustee by deducting all accrued fees and other liabilities
of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the
Bullion and all other assets held by the Trust.

Inspection of Bullion 

Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s
auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit the premises of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose
of examining the Trust s Bullion and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. Under the Allocated Account Agreement,
the Custodian agreed to procure similar inspection rights from the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Visits by auditors and inspectors to the Zurich
Sub-Custodian s facilities will be arranged through the Custodian. Other than with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee
and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes of examining the Trust s Bullion or any
records maintained by the sub-custodian and no sub-custodian is obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish
to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such sub-custodian. 

The Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian in order to
examine the Bullion and the records maintained by the Custodian. An inspection was conducted by Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd, a leading
commodity inspection and testing company retained by the Sponsor, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 

There can be no guarantee that the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors
and inspectors will be able to perform physical inspections of the Trust s Bullion as planned. Local policies, regulations, or ordinances,
as well as polices or restrictions adopted by the Custodian or a sub-custodian, may temporarily prevent, or otherwise impair the ability
of, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors, from performing a physical inspection of the Trust s Bullion on a
desired date. In those situations, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may seek to verify the Bullion held by the
Trust by alternate means, including through virtual inspections of the Trust s Bullion and/or a review of pertinent records. 

Liquidity 

The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material
changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses
incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s
Fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its transfers and sales of Bullion. 

50 

The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s Bullion (only in the specified
proportion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium held by the Trust) as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses not
otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell Bullion to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s
Fee through in-kind transfers of Bullion to the Sponsor. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Trust did not have any cash
balances.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

The
Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, the
Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Internal
controls over financial reporting have been maintained throughout the Trust s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There
have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or Sponsor s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Sponsor s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trust s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the Trust s assets; 

(2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with appropriate authorizations; and 

(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Trust s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Their assessment
included an evaluation of the design of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

KPMG
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the financial statements included in this
Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is included herein, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Trust s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Sponsor, Trustee and Shareholders 
abrdn Precious
Metals Basket ETF Trust: 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 We have audited abrdn Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust's
(known as Aberdeen Standard Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust) internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the statements of assets and liabilities of the Trust, including the
schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and the financial
highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the financial
statements), and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

 The Trust s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Trust s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the 

 U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

 A company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Sponsor, Trustee and Shareholders 
abrdn Precious
Metals Basket ETF Trust: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying statements of
assets and liabilities of abrdn Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust (known as Aberdeen Standard Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust prior to
March 31, 2022) (the Trust), including the schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations
and changes in net assets and the financial highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the
related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets and
financial highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter
arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence
of the bullion holdings 

 As presented on the December 31, 2022 schedule of investments
and in Note 2.2, the fair value of the Trust s investment in bullion is 1,003,576 thousand, representing 99.61 of the Trust s
net assets, and 11,976,598 ounces of bullion holdings. The investment in bullion was held by a third-party custodian or sub-custodian
(collectively, the custodian). 

We identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining
to the existence of the bullion holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the bullion holdings, subjective auditor
judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the existence of bullion held by the custodian. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to
address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related
to the critical audit matter. This included controls over (1) the comparison of the Trust s records of bullion held to the custodian s
records, (2) the approval of bullion deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of the Trust and (3) the physical counts of the Trust s
bullion holdings performed at the custodian s locations by a third party engaged by the Trust s sponsor. We obtained a schedule
directly from the custodian of the Trust s bullion holdings held by the custodian as of December 31, 2022. We compared the total
ounces on such schedule to the Trust s record of bullion holdings. We also attended and observed a part of the physical counts of
the Trust s bullion holdings. We obtained and read the physical counts results reports of the third party and reconciled those reports
to both the Trust s and custodian s records.

ounces of gold it holds ounces of silver, ounces of platinum and ounces of palladium (together, Bullion ).
The Trust issues abrdn Physical Precious Metals Basket Shares ETF Shares in minimum blocks of 
Shares (also referred to as Baskets in exchange for deposits of Bullion and distributes Bullion in
connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership
of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
abrdn Inc. abrdn Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of abrdn (formerly known as Standard Life Aberdeen) plc. The Trust
is governed by the Trust Agreement. 

The investment objective of the Trust is
for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium, less the Trust s expenses
and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a Shareholder an opportunity to participate in the gold, silver, platinum and palladium markets through an investment in securities. 

of the Trust s palladium and of the Trust s platinum was held by one or more sub-custodians. At December 31, 2022 of the Trust s
gold or silver was held by a sub-custodian. 

The Trust s Bullion is recorded, per individual metal
type, at fair value. The cost of Bullion is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the
relevant London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust. This is the applicable London Bullion Market
Association LBMA PM Gold Price for the price of an ounce of gold, the LBMA Silver Price for
silver, and for platinum and palladium the applicable London Metal Exchange LME PM Price . 

Realized gains and losses on transfers of Bullion, or Bullion
distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and average
cost of Bullion transferred. 

The LBMA PM Gold Price is set using the afternoon session of
the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA equilibrium auction, an electronic, tradable and auditable over-the-counter
auction market with the ability to settle trades in US Dollars, Euros or British Pounds for LBMA authorized participating gold
bullion banks or market makers that establishes a reference gold price for that day s trading. The London Metal Price 
for gold held by the Trust is the LBMA PM Gold Price. 

The IBA conducts an electronic, over-the-counter silver auction
in London, England to establish a fixing price for an ounce of silver once each trading day, which is disseminated by major market
vendors (the LBMA Silver Price ). The LBMA Silver Price is established by the thirteen LBMA authorized bullion banks and
market makers participating in the auction and disseminated by major market vendors. The London Metal Price 
for silver held by the Trust is the LBMA Silver Price. 

The LME is responsible for the administration of the electronic
platinum and palladium bullion price fixing system LMEbullion as well as providing electronic market clearing processes
for platinum and palladium bullion transactions at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. LMEbullion establishes
and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of platinum and palladium twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning
at 9:45 a.m. London time (the LME AM Fix and 2:00 p.m. London time (the LME PM Fix ). The London
Metal Price for platinum and palladium held by the Trust is the LME PM Fix. 

Once the value of Bullion has been determined, the net
asset value (the NAV is computed by the Trustee by deducting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of
the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the Bullion
and all other assets held by the Trust. 

The Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment
in Bullion as changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment in Bullion through the Statement of Operations. 

The per Share amount of Bullion exchanged for a purchase
or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee using the London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust to calculate the
Bullion amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering Bullion sales have not yet been made, and represents the per
Share amount of Bullion held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any
losses that may have occurred. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are as follows: 

Level 1. Unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level 2. Observable inputs other
than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument
on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data. 

Level 3. Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s own assumptions
about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best
information available. 

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that
are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree
of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3. 

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which
the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety. 

The Trust s investment in Bullion is classified as
a level 1 asset, as its value is calculated using unadjusted quoted prices from primary market sources. 

There were no transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

of Bullion receivable for the creation of Shares and 
Bullion payable for the redemption of Shares. At December 31, 2021, the Trust had Bullion receivable or payable
for the creation or redemption of Shares. 

Shares). The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized
Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust.
An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank
or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions; (2) is
a participant in The Depository Trust Company; (3) has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trustee and the
Sponsor; and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account with the Trust s Custodian or other Bullion
clearing bank. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor and
the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the Bullion required
for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is an unallocated Bullion account, either
loco London or loco Zurich, established with the Custodian or a Bullion clearing bank by an Authorized Participant. 

The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in
exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of Bullion represented by the Baskets
being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being
created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized Participants may, on any business day, place an order
with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. The typical settlement period for Shares is two business days. In the
event of a trade date at period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective account receivable and/or payable will be recorded.
When Bullion is exchanged in settlement of a redemption, it is considered a sale of Bullion for financial statement purposes. 

The amount of Bullion represented by the Baskets created
or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce. As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption
of Shares may differ from the value of Bullion to be delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the
correct amount of Bullion is available at all times to back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its management
fees in the event of any shortfall or excess on each transaction. For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th of
an ounce of Bullion. 

As the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the
option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding Shares as Net Assets. Changes in the number of Shares
outstanding are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. 

reserves for uncertain tax positions are
required as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

The Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing
expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee
and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to per annum in legal expenses.

At December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021, the
fees payable to the Sponsor were and , respectively. 

With respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor,
the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s Bullion as necessary to
pay these expenses. When selling Bullion to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of Bullion
needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than Bullion. Other than the Sponsor s
Fee, the Trust had expenses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling Bullion
the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust. The Trustee
will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable
price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such Bullion only if the sale transaction is made at
the London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust used by the Trustee to value the Trust s Bullion. A gain or loss
is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost of the Bullion sold. Neither the Trustee
nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized gains and losses result from the transfer of Bullion
for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value
and average cost of Bullion transferred.
