Our
corporate structure is as follows: 

DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS 

The
Company has seen a business opportunity in wholesaling and retailing high quality, sustainable, environmentally friendly bio-carbon-based
fertilizer (herein referred to as BCBF ), which is capable of not only increasing the crop yield but also at the same time
preserving the environment. The Company s BCBF is sourced from, and produced by, a third party through heating straw in a closed
container with little or no available air. This method is also known as thermal decomposition of organic material under limited supply
of oxygen at relatively low temperature. In accordance with requirements imposed by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, the Company s
Supplier of BCBF has registered with Sichuan Province Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which has an effective
period of 5 years, from December 2019 to December 2024. The Company does not maintain or operate any production and/or manufacturing
of any BCBF facility, machine and/or equipment. 

5 

The
Company is currently wholesaling and retailing BCBF through its wholly owned subsidiary SCQC. Management of the Company believes that
the BCBF sold by the Company is capable of maintaining soil fertility, enhancing crop yield, improving soil structure, improving water
and fertilizer retention capability and improving fertilizer utilization efficiency and effectiveness. This is achieved through balancing
carbon and nitrogen content, neutralizing soil pH while at the same time creating soil particle structure that is conducive to plant
growth. 

The
BCBF sold by the Company, produced through straw thermal decomposition, replaces the function of activated carbon. The combination of
soil and BCBF is capable of absorbing and reducing pollution content such as heavy metals from agricultural residual wastes. Further,
the combination of water and BCBF is capable of purifying water by producing carbohydrate and glucose, which could be absorbed by, and
is conducive to the growth of, plants. Additionally, BCBF possesses outstanding water storage capacity, which can store up to 10 times
the water content when compared to soil without BCBF, which in turn provides farmers greater flexibility during times of hardship such
as a drought. 

As
such, the management of the Company believes that the Company s BCBF is not only a superior option compared to conventional fertilizer
in terms of environmentally sustainability, but also from an economic perspective due to the improvement in crop yield quality and quantity.
The Company s BCBF consists of roughly 45 organic matter, 20 bio-charcoal, 10 humic acid, 5 NPK and boats an effective microorganism
count of 20,000,000 per gram. 

On
July 25, 2022, the Company ventures into online retailing business through e-commerce platform, retailing a series of daily use products
covering from healthcare products, cosmetic products, fashion products, household products and so forth. Customer will place order through
platform and make payment accordingly of which shall be collected by Company. Meanwhile Company shall place exact order towards supplier
and supplier will deliver such ordered products directly to customer, settlement between Company and supplier will take place once a
week. It is worth mentioning that the Company act as the intermediary role and do not keep any form of inventory throughout the transaction. 

Bio-carbon-based-fertilizer,
BCBF

Business
Model 

The
Company previously sources all supply of BCBF from an independent single supplier and doesn t have any definitive plan to continue
to source from such supplier or any other alternative. The Company believes current stock level is sufficient to cover next 12 months
sales demand. 

The
Company adopts what is commonly referred to as a virtual network business structure, as the Company only maintains internal procurement,
sales and marketing, operational, accounting and finance functions. We rely entirely on an independent third party for other crucial
functions, such as production and packaging, storage, courier inward and outward. It is our belief that this business structure empowers
the Company with a higher degree of flexibility to exploit market opportunity, but it is also difficult to ascertain the quality of BCBF
sourced and stored externally. Confidentiality of information, such as the identity of customers, is also at risk because such information
is shared amongst designated warehouses, the responsibility of which is discussed below. 

Procurement
Order and Courier Inward 

As
per our practices with previous supplier, the Company, through subsidiary SCQC, has prepaid a mutually agreed upon deposit to the supplier.
Upon placing an order with the supplier, they will either move to production of the requested BCBF or, if stock is readily available,
they will ship the requested amount to designated warehouse operate and owned by third party (herein referred as the Warehouser ). 

Shipment
costs are borne solely by SCQC, while any remaining outstanding payable balance to supplier, if not covered by the deposit to the supplier,
shall be settled upon arrival of products. 

The
Company believes, for future procurement with alternate supplier is highly likely to follow this pattern of procurement order. 

Storage,
Dispatch Order and Courier Outward 

Upon
the arrival of BCBF, Warehouser shall examine the condition and quantity of BCBF based upon instructions provided by SCQC. If the BCBF
meets quality standards, they will unload the BCBF from the supplier s logistic vehicle and will proceed to store the BCBF. Warehouser
bears responsibility to ensure that the condition of the warehouse is optimal for storage. 

Upon
receiving dispatch orders from SCQC, the warehouse personnel shall be responsible to deliver BCBF to customers location, as designated
by SCQC and to subsequently collect a receipt from SCQC customers. 

Sales
and Marketing 

The
Company, through SCQC, retails and wholesales BCBF, primarily to farmers. We rely upon sales and marketing personnel at present, and
it is our intention to establish product branding and a positive reputation which will allow us to grow beyond internal sales and marketing.
On top of existing sales personnel, the Company also intends to capitalize on customer connections through a referral program which rewards
referring customers with discounts. All such plans pertaining to the referral program remain in development, and we cannot state with
any level of specificity when they will move beyond the planning stages. 

Generally,
retail and wholesale customers are not entitled for a credit term, the only difference is that for retail customers all payments must
be settled immediately upon placing the order, at which point SCQC will issue a dispatch order to the warehouse. Whereas for wholesale
customers, a deposit can be made upon placing the order and the remaining balance is to be settled upon delivery of BCBF. However, in
certain cases, or from time to time at the discretion of Management, SCQC may grant customers a certain credit term if they believe it
to be beneficial to the performance and business sustainability of the Company in the long term. 

Employees
and Function 

The
Company has 6 employees. All of them work on a full-time basis, including our director, Ms. Wang Min. The Company provides benefits to
each employee excluding sales, marketing and after sales service department employee, in the form of 40 travelling allowance per month
and a 40 telecommunication allowance per month. Additionally, the Company maintains mandatory social security for pensions, medical,
unemployment, work-related injury and maternity insurance. The Company segregates individual employees in accordance to function as displayed

Competition 

Overall,
the competitive environment of China s fertilizer industry is very tense despite its market size. The Company competes with other
manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers such as China Green Agriculture, Inc. (NYSE: CGA), Sinofert Holdings Limited (HKG: 0297) and
Xinyangfeng Agricultural Technology Co Ltd (SHE: 000902). These competitors possess significantly greater financial and non-financial
resources, manufacturing capacity, well established business models and distribution channels and branding. 

At
present, the Company relies entirely on its existing relationship with customers in order to function within this competitive fertilizer
industry. However, despite intensive competition our director is confident to develop and enlarge our market share in China.

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock.

In
regards to all of the above transactions we claim an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4a(2) and/or Regulation S of the

(as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were
made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of
the foregoing.

was fully utilized after 6 months, up to December 31, 2021. Due to inexperience in managing public company, the Company relied on external
professional parties to prepare report in compliance with Securities Exchange Act 1934, as such compliance and reporting expenses is
close to 12 months use of proceeds budget despite 6 months down. while offering expenses is fairly close to use of proceed disclosed
in Registration Statement. 

Actual
general and administrative expenses has substantially exceeded use of proceed disclosed in Registration Statement as the Company has
allocated a substantial portion of use of proceed for the payment of consulting fee to unrelated third party for the provision of corporate
management consultancy including corporate management, corporate development strategy, organization management, human resources management,
and corporate culture development, for the fiscal year 2021. In absence of such consulting fee, general and administrative expenses should
be fairly close to use of proceed disclosed in Registration Statement.

as all use of proceeds from public offering was fully utilized. All of aforementioned expenses were direct payment to non-related third-party

Company
Overview 

The
Company has seen a business opportunity in wholesaling and retailing high quality, sustainable, environmentally friendly bio-carbon-based
fertilizer (herein referred to as BCBF ), which is capable of not only increasing the crop yield but also at the same time
preserving the environment. The Company s BCBF is sourced from, and produced by, a third party through heating straw in a closed
container with little or no available air. This method is also known as thermal decomposition of organic material under limited supply
of oxygen at relatively low temperature. In accordance with requirements imposed by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, the Company s
Supplier of BCBF has registered with Sichuan Province Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which has an effective
period of 5 years, from December 2019 to December 2024. The Company does not maintain or operate any production and/or manufacturing
of any BCBF facility, machine and/or equipment. 

The
Company is currently wholesaling and retailing BCBF through its wholly owned subsidiary SCQC. Management of the Company believes that
the BCBF sold by the Company is capable of maintaining soil fertility, enhancing crop yield, improving soil structure, improving water
and fertilizer retention capability and improving fertilizer utilization efficiency and effectiveness. This is achieved through balancing
carbon and nitrogen content, neutralizing soil pH while at the same time creating soil particle structure that is conducive to plant
growth. 

The
BCBF sold by the Company, produced through straw thermal decomposition, replaces the function of activated carbon. The combination of
soil and BCBF is capable of absorbing and reducing pollution content such as heavy metals from agricultural residual wastes. Further,
the combination of water and BCBF is capable of purifying water by producing carbohydrate and glucose, which could be absorbed by, and
is conducive to the growth of, plants. Additionally, BCBF possesses outstanding water storage capacity, which can store up to 10 times
the water content when compared to soil without BCBF, which in turn provides farmers greater flexibility during times of hardship such
as a drought. 

As
such, the management of the Company believes that the Company s BCBF is not only a superior option compared to conventional fertilizer
in terms of environmentally sustainability, but also from an economic perspective due to the improvement in crop yield quality and quantity.
The Company s BCBF consists of roughly 45 organic matter, 20 bio-charcoal, 10 humic acid, 5 NPK and boats an effective microorganism
count of 20,000,000 per gram. 

On
July 25, 2022, the Company ventures into online retailing business through e-commerce platform, retailing a series of daily use products
covering from healthcare products, cosmetic products, fashion products, household products and so forth. Customer will place order through
platform and make payment accordingly of which shall be collected by Company. Meanwhile Company shall place exact order towards supplier
and supplier will deliver such ordered products directly to customer, settlement between Company and supplier will take place once a
week. It is worth mentioning that the Company act as the intermediary role and do not keep any form of inventory throughout the transaction.

Foreign
Currency 

Most
of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently freely convertible under the current
account, which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, 
which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Under our current corporate structure, our company in the United States may rely
on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. 

Under
existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including payment of dividends, interest payments and trade
and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Our PRC subsidiaries may also retain foreign exchange
in its current account, subject to a ceiling approved by SAFE, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However,
we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC governmental authorities will not limit or eliminate our ability to purchase and retain foreign
currencies in the future. 

Since
a significant amount of our future revenues will be denominated in Renminbi, the existing and any future restrictions on currency exchange
may limit our ability to utilize revenues generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China, if any, or expenditures
denominated in foreign currencies. 

Foreign
exchange transactions under the capital account are subject to limitations and require registration with or approval by the relevant
PRC governmental authorities. In particular, any transfer of funds from us to any of our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan
or as an increase in registered capital, is subject to certain statutory limit requirements and registration or approval of the relevant
PRC governmental authorities, including the relevant administration of foreign exchange and/or the relevant examining and approval authority.
Our ability to use the U.S. dollar proceeds of the sale of our equity or debt to finance our business activities conducted through our
PRC subsidiaries will depend on our ability to obtain these governmental registrations or approvals. In addition, because of the regulatory
issues related to foreign currency loans to, and foreign investment in, domestic PRC enterprises, we may not be able to finance the operations
of our PRC subsidiaries by loans or capital contributions. We cannot assure you that we can obtain these governmental registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

The
amount of cash denominated in RMB is approximately CNY1,573,043 (Equivalent to USD227,680) as of December 31, 2022.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of YCQH Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of YCQH Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd together with its subsidiaries the
Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders 
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

Going
concern uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company incurred loss of 74,450
for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting in accumulated deficit of 389,987 and a working capital deficit of 263,641 that raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Emphasis
of Matter 

The
Company has significant transactions with a director, which are described in Note 8 to the financial statements. Transactions involving
related party cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market
dealings may not exist.

value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial
direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line
basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. 

In
determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company
incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments.

The
Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire funding through
public offering. If funding from public offering is insufficient, then the Company shall rely on the financial support from its controlling
shareholder. 

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer , of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation
of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting,
our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority
of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (4) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified
resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet
to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive
officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

1. 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

2. 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and 

3. 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

31 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls. 

As
of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on such evaluation, the Company s management concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, our internal control
over financial reporting were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

Since
2021, we engaged Dude Business Consultants Limited as an external consultant to assist with the identification and address of complex
and proper accounting issues. 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we also plan to initiate
the following series of measures to further strengthen the Company s internal controls going forward: 

1. 
 hire
 a reporting manager Internal Finance Manager who has the requisite relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience
 and qualifications; 

2. 
 make
 an overall assessment on the current finance and accounting resources and hire additional accounting members with appropriate levels
 of accounting knowledge and experience; 

3. 
 streamline
 our accounting department structure and enhance our staff s U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements on a continuous basis
 through internal training provided by the Internal Finance manager; 

4. 
 participate
 in trainings and seminars provided by professional services firms on a regular basis to gain knowledge on regular U.S. GAAP / SEC
 reporting requirements updates; and 

5. 
 engage
 an external Sarbanes-Oxley 404 consulting firm to help us implement Sarbanes-Oxley 404 internal controls compliance
 together with the establishment of our internal audit function. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2022. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members on our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believe that it is not necessary to have
such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Executive
Compensation Philosophy 

Our
Board of Directors determines the compensation given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors reserves
the right to pay our executives or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock issued in consideration for
services rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s
performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance
of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance
base stock options to date, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination
believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company. 

Incentive
Bonus 

The
Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the
Board of Directors believes such bonuses are in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and
growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability
of such executives. 

Long-term,
Stock Based Compensation 

In
order to attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award
our executives and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our Board
of Directors, which we do not currently have any immediate plans to award.

Beneficial
ownership in the table above has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares
may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose
of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for
example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the
percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person
by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table
does not necessarily reflect the person s actual voting power at any particular date.

made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of
the foregoing.

of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officer, Director and significant stockholders. We intend to establish
formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional Directors, so that such
