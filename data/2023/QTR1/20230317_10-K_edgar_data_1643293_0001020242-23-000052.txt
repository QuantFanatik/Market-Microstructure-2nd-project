EXPLANATORY NOTES 

 The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their
capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 1.8 of the
asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is
part of a loan combination that includes the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan and two other pari passu loans, which are not assets of
the issuing entity. A pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized in the COMM 2015-CCRE24 Mortgage Trust transaction,
Commission File Number 333-193376-21 (the COMM 2015-CCRE24 Transaction ). This loan combination, including the La
Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2015-CCRE24
Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

 The master servicer of a pooling and servicing agreement or trust and servicing
agreement also functions as the primary servicer of the related mortgage loans serviced and administered pursuant to such agreement unless
a separate primary servicer is identified herein. If this report does not identify a separate primary servicer, the servicer compliance
statement provided by the master servicer under any such agreement also encompasses its responsibilities as primary servicer of the related
mortgage loan or mortgage loans. 

 Park Bridge Lender Services LLC is the operating advisor of the mortgage
loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan. As a result, Park Bridge Lender Services
LLC is a servicing function participant in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 5 
or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and
accountants attestation reports delivered by Park Bridge Lender Services LLC in the capacities described above are listed in the
Exhibit Index. 

 Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark is an affiliate of Cantor Commercial
Real Estate Lending, L.P., one of the sponsors. Therefore, the Depositor included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a servicer
compliance statement for Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark pursuant to Item 1123. Because Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a
Newmark is servicing less than 5 of the pool assets, an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and an accountants 
attestation report pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB are not required by Regulation AB. As the attestation made in the servicer
compliance statement required by Item 1123 relates to a review of the servicing activities of Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark
under the applicable servicing agreement, and that review was conducted in conjunction with the servicer s preparation of its assessment
of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, that assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and the accompanying
accountants attestation report are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sake of completeness. 

 Wilmington Trust, National Association acts as trustee of the mortgage loans
serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
and the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2015-CCRE24 Transaction, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees
regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved
as specified in the transaction agreements). However, during the reporting period, the trustee did not perform any servicing function
with respect to the servicing criteria specified in Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB. The master servicer or the special servicer,
to the extent required, performed the servicing function identified with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, and each such
party included Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB in the assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant s
attestation report for the subject transaction. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. One or more other servicers of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan have delivered one or more assessments of compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii)
of Regulation AB. 

 The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants 
attestation report and servicer compliance statement of the certificate administrator of the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan is omitted from
this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the certificate administrator pursuant to the related pooling and servicing agreement or trust and
servicing agreement does not perform any activities that address servicing criteria with respect to the issuing entity and because it
is not a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB. 

 With respect to the pari passu loan combination that includes the
La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan, (i) the reports on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria and attestation reports on assessment
of compliance with servicing criteria of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as primary servicer and custodian of the La Gran Plaza
Mortgage Loan and LNR Partners, LLC as special servicer of the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan, listed on the Exhibit Index are omitted from
this Annual Report on Form 10-K as they are not required to be included on this Annual Report on Form 10-K per Instruction 3 to Item 1122
of Regulation AB because they are parties performing activities that address servicing criteria relating to 5 or less of the assets of
the issuing entity; and (ii) the servicer compliance statements of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as primary servicer of the La
Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan and LNR Partners, LLC as special servicer of the La Gran Plaza Mortgage Loan, listed on the Exhibit Index are
omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K as they are not required by Item 1123 of Regulation AB to be included on this Annual Report
on Form 10-K because they are each an unaffiliated party that is not a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i)
through (iii) of Regulation AB.

 Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

 The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the
trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following,
with respect to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Certificate Administrator and Custodian, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as Certificate Administrator and Custodian. 

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential
mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 

On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors,
LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and
DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of representations and warranties
as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing obligations for the trusts.
During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the Superior
Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the
 BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed on January 11, 2019. 

On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain
special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which
the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs
filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts
at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation
of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence;
violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs
acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence
claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs breach of contract
claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions
of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and
DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank
case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary
judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s
supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs 
motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March
10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s
orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. 

On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank
AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged
incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint
that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee
for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract;
breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second amended
complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the
trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith,
and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA
caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint does not include a demand for
money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018,
DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs,
filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s
motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs 
claims and theories were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 

On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank
A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims
for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation
of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are
liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits
by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as
to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court
granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation
of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice
of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding certain aspects of the court s order on
the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30,
2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the court s order on
the motion to dismiss. On November 10, 2022, the First Department granted DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for leave to appeal to the Court
of Appeals, and denied IKB s separate motion for reargument and leave to appeal. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument
regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021,
DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice
all claims as to seven additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice
all claims as to one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims
as to 17 certificates at issue (including all claims as to 5 trusts), leaving 17 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 

 It is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including,
based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability
to perform its duties under the related servicing agreement. 

 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related
entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar
allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank
in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and
plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default,
and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s
claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National
Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar
lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective
mortgage loan documentation.

and Related Transactions. 

 The information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a prospectus
supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing entity filed on June 18, 2015 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5). 

 Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

 The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria for
asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the mortgage loans are attached

 The report on assessment of compliance for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022, furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by KeyBank National Association KeyBank ), as
servicer, discloses that the following material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to its platform: 

 The examination performed by Ernst Young LLP identified an instance
of material noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(4)(ix) of Regulation AB applicable to KeyBank during the
year ended December 31, 2022. During compliance testing, it was discovered, that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates
within 45-60 days before the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset documents. Per the related note, if the holder fails
to offer a loan rate within 45-60 days of any change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification was not made to the
borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The noncompliance in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which is
wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

 The following remediation procedures have been initiated by KeyBank: (i)
the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the process of being identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective
actions are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if
necessary, to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided
to the relevant staff members to prevent a recurrence.

MANAGEMENT S ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE 

Management of the Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company is responsible for assessing the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine which criteria
are applicable to the Company in respect of the servicing platform described below. Management has determined that the servicing criteria
are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: 

Platform : Publicly-issued i.e. , transaction-level reporting required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e. , for which transaction-level reporting
is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities
administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored
or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform (see Appendix A). 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d),
to the extent required by Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform
as to any transaction, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has determined are
not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).
With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) there were no activities
performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would
require the Company to perform such activities. 

Period : Year ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Management's interpretation of Applicable Servicing Criteria : The Company s
management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) is applicable only with respect to its continuing obligation to act
as, or locate a, successor servicer under the circumstances referred to in certain transaction agreements. It is management's interpretation
that the Company has no other active back-up servicing responsibilities in regards to servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) as of and for
the Period. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the activities
the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the accurate conveyance
of such information within reports to investors. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii)
is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s obligation
to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. 

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company s management
provides the following assertion of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

The Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. 

The Company s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation
AB. 

Based on such assessment, the Company has complied, in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. 

Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report with respect to management s assertion of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for
the Period.

RE: Management's Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance by 
Park Bridge Lender Services LLC with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

 Park Bridge Lender Services LLC (the Asserting Party or PBLS is responsible for assessing its compliance, as of and for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ),
with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

 The transactions covered by this assertion are those transactions processed
by the Asserting Party in its capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor for the asset-backed securities transactions listed in Exhibit
A attached hereto (the Platform ). 

 The Asserting Party is responsible for assessing its compliance with
the servicing criteria applicable to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R.
229.1122) to assess its compliance. The full outline of the Asserting Party's contractually applicable servicing criteria under various
securitization pooling and servicing agreements can be found in Exhibit B attached hereto. The servicing criteria listed in the
column title Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto are not applicable to the Asserting Party based on
the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 

 Based on its assessment, the Asserting Party believes that, as of and for the
periods the contractual obligations existed for the Platform in the Reporting Period, the Asserting Party has complied in all material
respects with the servicing criteria listed in the column title Applicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

 FORVIS, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in
this assertion.

MANAGEMENT S ASSERTION ON 

 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank National Association, as successor
by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance for
the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ), with
the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for
the servicing criteria which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable
Servicing Criteria ), to the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans
and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122 (d)(1)(iii)
of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2022, that required
this servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The Asserting Party has assessed compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material
respects, except as discussed in Appendix C, with the applicable servicing criteria for the transactions listed on Appendix A backed by
commercial real estate mortgage loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The Asserting Party has engaged a vendor
to perform the activities required by the servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to
take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation
AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers 
C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
the vendor and related criteria. 

Ernst Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

KeyBank National Association 
Management s Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 
For the Period of January 1 through December 31, 2022 
Appendix C 

 KeyBank National Association (KeyBank) has identified the following
material instance of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix) during the calendar year ended December 31, 2022, with respect
to the Platform. 

1) Servicing Criteria impacted 

 1122(d)(4)(ix) Adjustments to interest rates or rates
of return for pool assets with variable rates are computed based on the related pool asset documents. 

2) Material Instance of Noncompliance with Servicing Criteria 

 During compliance testing, it
was discovered, that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within 45-60 days before the rate change date, as required
per the related pool asset documents. Per the Note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60 days of any change date a margin
of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification was not made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The noncompliance in
Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which is wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security . 

3) Remediation 

 The following remediation procedures have been initiated by KeyBank:
(i) the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the process of being identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective
actions are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if
necessary, to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided
to the relevant staff members to prevent a recurrence.

MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA
PURSUANT TO ITEM 1122 OF REGULATION AB 

Management of Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark Newmark is responsible
for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC relating to its role in the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions conducted by
Newmark (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ). Appendix A identifies
the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. 

 Newmark's management has assessed Newmark's compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria during the Reporting Period. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the SEC in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Appendix B, which management has determined are not applicable
to the servicing activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 

 With respect to applicable servicing criteria identified
in Appendix C, there were no activities performed for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform, because there was no occurrence
of events that would require Newmark to perform such activities. 

 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii),
management has engaged Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association Midland to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. Newmark management has determined that Midland is not a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Newmark's management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria
applicable to Midland as permitted by the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C D1 200.06, Vendors Engaged
by Servicers (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Regulation AB Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations, 17.06). Management
has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that Midland's activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to Midland. Newmark has not identified and is not aware of any material instances of noncompliance
by Midland with the applicable servicing criteria during the Reporting Period, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole, nor has
it identified any material deficiencies in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by Midland with the applicable servicing
criteria during the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. Newmark is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for Midland and the related criteria. 

 Based on such assessment, management believes that with respect to the Reporting
Period, Newmark has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the SEC,
including servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v),1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06
as described above relating to its role in the servicing of the Platform. 

Ernst and Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
Issued an attestation report with respect to management's assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria with respect
to the Reporting Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To the Board of Directors, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National
Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! 
Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company
has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by them with respect to the Platform. Midland s management
is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based
on our examination. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has
engaged certain vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors
are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation
200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it
has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures
with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects,
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or
subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered
by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide,
a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management s assertion that Midland
complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for all transactions serviced

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects,
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including
tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected
activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction
included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior
to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered
by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

 As described in management s assertion, for
servicing criteria Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as
permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ).
As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors.
The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 

200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion,
and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied
with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the commercial mortgage loan platform,
is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm 

 Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas 

 We have examined management s assertion,
included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank
National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level
reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level
reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities
and other asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator,
securities administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities
sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 except
for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs
with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the
asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

 Our examination was conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated
or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although
the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii)
of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these
servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

 We are required to be independent of
the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination
engagement. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the platform is
fairly stated, in all material respects.

all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether management s assertion is
fairly stated, in all material respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 The Board of Directors and Shareholder KeyBank National Association 

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying
Management s Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as successor by merger
to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate mortgage loans platform, except for the instance of material
noncompliance described therein, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c),
1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122 (d)(3)(ii), 1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of management s assertion.
See Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for
the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all
of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division
of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were
limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures
were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were
no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be
complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 A member firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

Our examination disclosed the following material
noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix) applicable to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. With respect to
servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix), the servicer did not consistently process adjustments to interest rates in accordance with pool asset
documents. 

 We are required to be independent of Key Bank National
Association and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination
engagement. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company
has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company
has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted
by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to
the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor
and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to
apply C DI 200.06. 

 In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance
described in the third paragraph, the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi)
for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

As described in management s assertion, for
servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) , the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it
has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect
to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation
AB, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions platform,
is fairly stated, in all material respects.
