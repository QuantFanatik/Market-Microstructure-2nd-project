DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. As used in this annual report, the terms "we", "us", or "the Company", mean Metaterra Corp., unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated. DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 20, 2021. Our principal office address is located at Calle Principal 54, Munoz, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Our telephone number is 346-308-4967. We are in the business of selling auto parts that we purchase in the United States to customers in the Dominican Republic. We keep a small inventory of auto parts. Our goal is to maintain a 30 day turn around period for all inventory . We plan to develop a website that will display a variety of auto parts and their prices, and will advertise our services and fees. Our customers will be able to select auto parts on our website according to their budget and preferences. Our customers are also able to order auto parts which are not displayed on our website by specifying the make, model and year. When we do not have the auto parts that our client wants, we will search for it. We offer our auto parts at price marked-up from 15 to 25 of our cost. Our customers are asked to pay us the full price in advance. There is no guarantee that our customer will pay the full purchase price in advance. In some cases, we ask for lower advance payments and the remainder during 7 days after the auto parts are delivered. Also, there is no guarantee that we will receive desired commission payment and may have to lower our prices of auto parts, resulting in diminished profits or losses. When we do not take prepayment and buy auto parts at our own expense, there a chance that we do not sell them for an extended period of time or never at all, which will result in loss of revenue and disruption of our business. 3 | Page Table of Contents ITEM 1A.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 5 | Page Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATION As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 38,473. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the Period from Inception (January 20, 2021) to December 31, 2021 Revenue During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company generated 16,705 in revenue compared to -0- for the period from inception (January 20, 2021) to December 31, 2021. Operating Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred total expenses and professional fees of 37,732 compared to 741 for the period from inception (January 20, 2021) to December 31, 2021. Total operating expenses included costs of goods sold, general and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs. Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 37,732 compared to 741 for the period from inception (January 20, 2021) to December 31, 2021. The change in net loss was due to increase in operational expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at December 31, 2022 our total assets were 26,921 compared to 2,084 in total assets at December 31, 2021. As at December 31, 2022, our current liabilities were 24,044 compared to 825 as of December 31, 2021. Stockholders equity was 2,877 as of December 31, 2022 compared to deficit of 1,259 as of December 31, 2021. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 44,924, consisting of net loss of 37,732, depreciation expense of 112, increase in inventory of 17,304 and increase in accounts payable of 10,000. For the period from inception (January 20, 2021) to December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities was 741 consisting entirely of net loss.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased fixed assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 were 52,569, consisting of advances from a related party of 13,219 and proceeds from issuance of common shares of 39,350 compared to 2,825 for the period from inception (January 20, 2021) to December 31, 2021, consisting of advances from a related party of 825 and proceeds from issuance of common shares of 2,000. 6 | Page Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Metaterra Corp. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders (deficit)/equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 20, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 20, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /S/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022. PCAOB ID: March 29, 2023 F-1 Table of Contents METATERRA CORP.

F-5 Table of Contents METATERRA CORP. NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JANUARY 20, 2021) TO DECEMBER 31, 2022 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Further to above, In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in China, which initially been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and subsequently as Pandemic by the World Health Organization. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business; however, if the current economic conditions continue, the Company will be forced to significantly scale back its business operations and its growth plans, and could ultimately have a significant negative impact on the Company.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
