CONIFER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 PART I 
 ITEM 1. B USINESS 
 Legal Organization 
 Conifer Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNFR) is a Michigan domiciled insurance holding company formed in 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 3001 West Big Beaver Road, Suite 200, Troy, MI 48084 (telephone number: (248) 559-0840). Our corporate website address is www.cnfrh.com. 
 As used in this Form 10-K, references to Conifer, Conifer Holdings, the Company, our Company, we, us, and our refer to Conifer Holdings, Inc., a Michigan corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries Conifer Insurance Company CIC ), Red Cedar Insurance Company RCIC ), White Pine Insurance Company WPIC ), Sycamore Insurance Agency, Inc. Sycamore ), and, as of October 13, 2022, VSRM, Inc. VSRM ). CIC, RCIC and WPIC are collectively referred to as the Insurance Company Subsidiaries. On a stand-alone basis Conifer Holdings, Inc. is referred to as the Parent Company. 
 Business Overview 
 The Company is engaged in the sale of property and casualty insurance products and has organized its business model around three classes of insurance businesses: commercial lines, personal lines, and wholesale agency business. Within these three businesses, the Company offers various insurance products and insurance agency services. 
 Through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, we offer insurance coverage in specialty commercial and specialty personal product lines. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines E S carrier in 45 states including the District of Columbia. We are also licensed to write insurance as an admitted carrier in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states. 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write. Prior to June 30, 2021, we also generated commission and fee revenue in our wholesale agency business from third-party insurers. 
 Many of our products are targeted to traditionally profitable classes of policyholders that we believe are under-served by other insurers. We market and sell these insurance products through a network of over 4,900 independent agents that distribute our policies through approximately 940 sales offices. We are focused on growing our business in non commoditized property and casualty insurance markets, while maintaining underwriting discipline and a conservative investment strategy. 
 We have substantial expertise in serving the unique commercial insurance needs of owner operated businesses in the following markets: 
 Hospitality, such as restaurants, bars, taverns, and bowling centers (that require, among other lines, liquor liability insurance), as well as small grocery and convenience stores; 

Artisan contractors, such as plumbers, painters, carpenters, electricians and other independent contractors; and 

Security service providers, such as companies that provide security guard services, security alarm products and services, and private investigative services. 

In our commercial lines business, we seek to differentiate ourselves and provide value to small business owner operators by bundling different insurance products that meet a significant portion of their insurance needs. For example, in the hospitality market we offer property, casualty, and liquor liability, as well as, in some jurisdictions, workers compensation coverage. The breadth of our specialty commercial insurance products enables our agents and their small business clients to 
 3 

avoid the administrative costs and time required to seek coverage for each of these items from separate insurers. As such, we compete for commercial lines business based on our flexible product offerings and customer service, rather than on pricing alone. Of the commercial lines policies that were in-force on December 31, 2022, the average premium amount of an individual policy was 6,700. 
 We also have substantial expertise in providing specialty homeowners insurance products to targeted customers that are often under-served by other homeowners' insurance carriers. Our personal lines products primarily include low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we currently offer in Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana and Texas. 
 In our personal lines business, we largely target homeowners in need of dwelling insurance that is currently under-served by the insurance market, due to the modest value of their homes or the exposure to natural catastrophes in their geographic area. Because these homeowners are under-served, this portion of the market is typically subject to less pricing pressure from larger nationwide insurers that offer a more commoditized product. We believe our underwriting expertise enables us to compete effectively in these markets by evaluating and appropriately pricing risk. In addition, we believe our willingness to meet these under-served segments of the personal lines insurance market fosters deeper relationships with, and increased loyalty from, the agents who distribute our products. Of the personal lines policies that were in-force on December 31, 2022, the average premium amount of an individual policy was 1,200. 
 Overall, we structure the multi-line distribution of our premium between commercial and personal lines to better diversify our business and mitigate the potential cyclical nature of either market. In serving these markets, we write business on both an admitted and excess and surplus lines E S basis. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 48.0 of our gross written premiums were admitted, and approximately 52.0 were E S. Insurance companies writing on an admitted basis are licensed by the states in which they sell policies and are required to offer policies using premium rates and forms that are typically filed with and approved by the state insurance regulators. Carriers writing in the E S market are not bound by most of the rate and form regulations imposed on standard market (admitted) companies, allowing them the flexibility to change the coverage offered and the rate charged without the time constraints and financial costs associated with the filing and approval process subject to admitted business. Our corporate structure allows us to offer both admitted and E S products in select markets through either CIC or WPIC. Our experience with specialty insurance products enables us to react to new market opportunities and underwrite multiple specialty lines. 
 The wholesale agency business provides non-risk bearing revenue through commissions and policy fees. The wholesale agency business increases the product options to the Company s independent retail agents by offering both insurance products from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as products offered by other insurers. The wholesale agency business was sold to our 50 -owned affiliate, Venture Agency Holdings, Inc. Affiliate on June 30, 2021. As of that date, this business was no longer consolidated in the Company s financial statements. 
 Geographic Diversity and Mix of Business 
 Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on specific core commercial lines of business. We have shifted our focus to low-value dwelling lines of business in order to bring personal lines premium levels back up and to maintain a strategic balance of commercial and personal lines of business. 
 While we pursue top line premium growth, we do not do so at the expense of losing underwriting discipline. Our underwriters have the experience and institutional flexibility to recognize when to exit certain products in favor of more profitable opportunities as insurance market conditions dictate. The following tables summarize our gross written premiums by segment and state for the years indicated therein (dollars in thousands):

The Conifer Approach 
 We have built our business in a manner that is designed to adapt to changing market conditions and deliver predictable results over time. The following highlights key aspects of our model that contribute to our balanced approach: 
 Focus on under-served markets. We focus on providing specialty insurance products to targeted policyholders in under-served markets. We believe that most of our small business customers, many of which are owner operated, value the efficiency of dealing with a single insurer for multiple products. By targeting small- to medium-sized accounts, we add value to the business owner directly without competing solely on price. 

Strong relationships with our agents. We develop strong relationships with our independent agents providing them with responsive service, attractive commissions and competitive products to offer policyholders. We believe our agents understand that we view them as key partners in risk selection that help us serve our ultimate client - the insured. 

Deep understanding of the business and regulatory landscapes of our markets. The competition for insurance business and the regulatory operating environment vary significantly from state to state. We focus on tailoring our business to concentrate on the geographic markets and regulatory environments with the greatest opportunities for growth and profitability. Our business plan centers on identification of market opportunities in jurisdictions where our insurance products can profitably suit the needs of our potential customers. 

Emphasis on flexibility. We offer coverage to our insureds both on an E S and admitted basis. We believe this flexibility enables us to pivot effectively between E S and admitted policies as customer needs and regulatory conditions dictate. 

Conservative risk management with an emphasis on lowering volatility. We focus on the risk/reward of insurance underwriting, while maintaining a prudent investment policy. We employ conservative risk management practices and opportunistically purchase reinsurance to minimize our exposure to liability for individual risks. In addition, we seek to maintain a diversified liquid investment portfolio to reduce overall balance sheet volatility. As of December 31, 2022, our investments primarily consisted of fixed income investments with an average credit rating of AA+ and an option adjusted duration of 3.5 years.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following competitive strengths have allowed us to grow our business and will continue to support our strategic growth initiatives: 
 Talented underwriters with broad expertise. Our underwriters have significant experience managing account profitability across market cycles. With an average of over 28 years of experience, our senior underwriters possess the required expertise to respond appropriately to market forces. 

Controlled and disciplined underwriting. We underwrite substantially all policies to our specific guidelines with our experienced, in-house underwriting team. We customize the coverages we offer, and continually monitor our markets and respond to changes in our markets by adjusting our pricing, product structures and underwriting guidelines. By tailoring the terms and conditions of our policies, we align our actual underwriting risk with the profit of each insurance account that we write. 

Proactive claims handling. We employ a proactive claims handling philosophy that utilizes an internal team of experienced in-house attorneys to manage and supervise our claims from inception until resolution. We pay what we owe, contest what we don't, and make sound judgment for those claims that fall in between. Our proactive handling of claims reinforces our relationships with our customers and agents by demonstrating our willingness to defend our insureds aggressively and help them mitigate losses. 

Proven management team. Our senior management team has an average of over 29 years of experience in the insurance industry. Our senior management team has successfully created, managed and grown numerous insurance companies and books of business, and has longstanding relationships with many independent agents and policyholders in our targeted markets. 

Ability to leverage technology to drive efficiency. We utilize a web based information technology system that creates greater organizational efficiency in our company. Leveraging the infrastructure of programmers and support staff of third party vendors allows our in house business analysts to focus on new product development and roll out. We believe this capability reduces our time to market for new products, enhances services for insureds, increases our ability to capture data, and reduces cost. 

Marketing and Distribution 
 Independent agents are our main distribution source. The selection of an insurance company by a business or individual is strongly influenced by the business or individual s agent. We seek to maintain favorable relationships with our select group of agents. Our distribution philosophy is to treat our agents as partners, and we provide them with competitive products, personal service and attractive commissions. We believe these factors contribute to our positive agency retention. 
 In 2022, our top six independent agencies accounted for approximately 42 of our gross written premiums in our commercial lines, and our top four independent agencies accounted for approximately 45 of our gross written premiums in our personal lines. We have long term relationships with each of these agencies. We anticipate our concentration in these agencies will decrease in future periods as we establish relationships with additional agencies, as part of our strategic growth plan. Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries market and distribute their products mainly through an independent agency network, however we utilize managing general agents and certain key wholesalers when appropriate. 
 We recruit our producers through referrals from our existing network of agents, word of mouth, advertisement, as well as direct contacts initiated by potential agents. Our marketing efforts are directed through our offices in Michigan and Florida. 
 We view our agents as key partners in risk selection. We actively solicit their input regarding potential improvements to our business methods and consult with them in developing new products and entering new customer markets. At the same time, we take careful measure to appropriately control and monitor our agents operations. Controls include frequent review of the quality of business, loss experience and other mechanisms. We retain sole binding authority on the majority of our business. Binding authority is only granted to select long-term agents. When binding authority is granted, we restrict this authority to a specific set of guidelines that are provided to each agent. Moreover, our experienced underwriters review each risk to ensure the guidelines are followed. 
 6 

In addition to marketing to individual agents, our Sycamore Insurance Agency reviews specific opportunities to write select business on a direct basis. 
 Underwriting 
 We are focused on underwriting profitability and effective enterprise risk management. With an average of over 28 years of experience, our senior underwriters have the experience to properly manage account profitability across market cycles. 
 Our underwriting philosophy for our specialty commercial risks in the hospitality industry is to look at each risk individually and selectively before writing any policies. We remain focused on small- to medium-sized businesses where the owner is often on site and in a better position to efficiently and safely run the overall operations. We understand the risks associated with the smaller enterprises and, due to lighter competition, believe we can receive a fair premium to compensate for the risk taken. 
 With respect to commercial property coverages, we believe it is important to focus on the profitability of the insureds business, as well as the traditional risk factors. Therefore, in addition to obtaining inspections on commercial risks, we strive to understand the insureds business operations and bottom line to verify the underlying business is an acceptable risk. 
 All commercial and personal policy applications are underwritten according to established guidelines that have been provided to our independent agency force. These guidelines have been integrated into our information technology system framework and only policies that meet our guidelines are accepted by our system. Our underwriting staff has substantial industry experience in matching policy terms, conditions, and pricing to the risk profiles of our policyholders and therefore strengthens our ability to achieve profitability in the product lines we write. 
 Commercial Lines. In writing commercial lines policies, we frequently employ tailored limiting endorsements, rating surcharges and customized limits to align our product offerings to the risk profile of the class and the specific policyholder being underwritten. Furthermore, we consistently monitor our markets so that we are able to quickly implement changes in pricing, underwriting guidelines and product offerings as necessary to remain competitive. We do not pursue commercial product lines where competition is based primarily on price. We augment our own internally developed pricing models with benchmark rates and policy terms set forth by the Insurance Services Office, or ISO. The ISO system is a widely recognized industry resource for common and centralized rates and forms. It provides advisory ratings, statistical and actuarial services, sample policy provisions and other services to its members. 
 Personal Lines. We employ internal product managers to review our position relative to our competition, create better segmentation of pricing and originate premium rate changes as appropriate. Consistent with industry practice, we grant our personal lines agents limited binding authority within our specific guidelines. Once a completed application and premium payment are submitted to us, the application is placed in a bound status, and reviewed for final approval. If the agent has underwritten and submitted the account according to our guidelines, we process the application as complete. If our guidelines have not been followed, the application may be cancelled or updated and re submitted for further underwriting review. 
 Claims 
 We believe that effective claims management is vitally important to our success, allowing us to cost effectively pay valid claims, while vigorously defending those claims that lack merit. Our claims department consists of experienced claims professionals located in Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas. We utilize a proactive claims handling philosophy to internally manage or supervise all of our claims from inception through final disposition. By handling our claims internally, we can quickly assess claims, improve communication with our policyholders and claimants and better control our claims management costs. 
 7 

We have several in house attorneys with considerable legal experience in trying cases in the lines of business we write. Included among these attorneys is our head in house litigator, who consults on all trials and has 28 years of litigation experience. We also have numerous seasoned property and liability adjusters which allow us to manage our claims exposures more carefully, across all markets. In addition, our claims professionals utilize a network of independent local adjusters and appraisers to assist with specific aspects of claims investigations, such as securing witness statements and conducting initial appraisals in states where it is practical to do so. These outside vendors are mainly compensated based on pre negotiated fee schedules to control overall costs. 
 Claims personnel are organized by line of business, with specific managers assigned as supervisors for each line of business. Reserving and payment authority levels of claims personnel are set by our Senior Vice President of claims and our Executive Vice President. Those limits of authority are integrated into our claims information technology systems to ensure strict compliance. 
 Initial claim reserves are determined and set using our statistical averages of paid indemnity and loss adjustment expenses by line of business. After reviewing statistical data and consulting with our internal actuary, our Senior Vice President of claims, together with other members of management, set initial reserves by line of business. Once initial reserves have been set, reserves are evaluated periodically as specific claim information changes to generate management s overall best estimate of reserves. In addition, claim reviews with in house adjusters and attorneys provide a regular opportunity to review the adequacy of reserves. Changes to claims reserves are made by senior management based on claim developments and input from these attorneys and adjusters. We utilize an in house actuary to support our financial efforts. 
 Reinsurance 
 We routinely purchase reinsurance for our commercial and personal lines to reduce volatility by limiting our exposure to large losses and to provide capacity for growth. In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a portion of the premium. We remain legally responsible for the entire obligation to policyholders, irrespective of any reinsurance coverage we may purchase. 
 Information relating to our reinsurance structure and treaty information is included within Note 8 ~ Reinsurance.

(1) The 2022 column includes 25.9 million of reinsurance recoverables from the loss portfolio transfer LPT described in Item 6: Selected Consolidated Financial Data. All previous years do not reflect any recoverables from the LPT. 

The first line of the table presents the unpaid loss and LAE reserves at December 31 for each year, net of reinsurance recoverables, including the incurred but not reported IBNR reserve. The next section of the table sets forth the re estimates of incurred losses from later years, including payments, for the years indicated. The increase/decrease from the original estimate would generally be a combination of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 Claims being settled for amounts different from the original estimates; 

Reserves being increased or decreased for individual claims that remain open as more information becomes known about those individual claims; and 

More or fewer claims being reported after the related year end, than had been expected to be reported before that date. 

As our historical data for a particular line of business increases, both in terms of the number of years of loss experience and the size of our data pool, we will increasingly rely upon our own loss experience rather than industry loss experience in 
 9 

establishing our loss and LAE reserves. We applied reserving practices consistent with historical methodologies and incorporated specific analyses where appropriate. 
 Additional information relating to our reserves is included within the Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses section of Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 ~ Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as in the Critical Accounting Policies: Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves section of Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis . 
 Regulation 
 Insurance Company Regulation 
 Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the states where they conduct business. State insurance regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of policyholders, consumers or claimants rather than shareholders or other investors. The nature and extent of such state regulation varies by jurisdiction, but generally involves: 
 Prior approval of the acquisition of control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company; 

Regulation of certain transactions entered into by such insurance company subsidiary with any of its affiliates; 

Approval of premium rates, forms and policies used for many lines of admitted insurance; 

Standards of solvency and minimum amounts of capital and surplus that must be maintained; 

Limitations on types and concentration of investments; 

Licensing of insurers and agents; 

Deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; and 

The filing of periodic reports with state insurance regulators with respect to financial condition and other matters. 

In addition, state regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. The results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other corrective action. 
 Insurance Holding Company Regulation 
 We operate as an insurance holding company and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These regulations require that each of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. The insurance laws similarly provide that all transactions among members of a holding company system must be fair and reasonable. Certain types of transactions between our Insurance Company Subsidiaries and the Company and our other affiliates generally must be disclosed to the state regulators, and prior approval of the state insurance regulator generally is required for any material or extraordinary transaction. In addition, a change of control of a domestic insurer or of any controlling person requires the prior approval of the state of domicile insurance regulator. 
 Various State and Federal Regulations 
 Insurance companies are also affected by a variety of state and federal legislative and regulatory measures and judicial decisions that define and extend the risks and benefits for which insurance is sought and provided. In addition, for some classes of insureds individual state insurance departments may prevent premium rates for some classes of insureds from reflecting the level of risk assumed by the insurer for those classes. Such developments may adversely affect the profitability of various lines of insurance. In some cases, if permitted by applicable regulations, these adverse effects on profitability can be minimized through repricing of coverages or limitations or cessation of the affected business. 
 Reinsurance Intermediary 
 Our reinsurance intermediaries are also subject to regulation. Under applicable regulations, an intermediary is responsible, as a fiduciary, for funds received on account of the parties to the reinsurance transaction. The intermediaries are 
 10 

required to hold such funds in appropriate bank accounts subject to restrictions on withdrawals and prohibitions on commingling. 
 Licensing and Agency Contracts 
 We, or certain of our designated employees, must be licensed to act as agents by regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business. Regulations and licensing laws vary in each state and are often complex. 
 Insurance licenses are issued by state insurance regulators upon application and may be of perpetual duration or may require periodic renewal. There are often requirements to obtain appropriate new licenses before we can begin writing or offer new coverages in a new state. The requirements are more stringent when writing on an admitted basis, as opposed to on an E S basis where there is greater form and rate flexibility. 
 Insurers operating on an admitted basis must file premium rate schedules and policy or coverage forms for review and approval by the insurance regulators. In many states, rates and policy forms must be approved prior to use, and insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether or not an insurer s rates are adequate, excessive and unfairly discriminatory. 
 The applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities, and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension and renewal of licenses. We, or our employees, could be excluded, or temporarily suspended, from continuing with some or all of our activities in, or otherwise subjected to penalties by, a particular state. 
 Membership in Insolvency Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools and Insurance Facilities 
 Most states require admitted property and casualty insurers to become members of insolvency funds or associations, which generally protect policyholders against the insolvency of insurers. Members of the fund or association must contribute to the payment of certain claims made against insolvent insurers. The Company's assessments from insolvency funds were minimal for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are also required to participate in various mandatory insurance facilities or in funding mandatory pools, which are generally designed to provide insurance coverage for consumers who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary insurance market. Among the pools participated in are those established in certain states to provide windstorm and other similar types of property coverage. These pools typically require all companies writing applicable lines of insurance in the state for which the pool has been established to fund deficiencies experienced by the pool based upon each company s relative premium writings in that state, with any excess funding typically distributed to the participating companies on the same basis. To the extent that reinsurance treaties do not cover these assessments, they may have an adverse effect on the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, total assessments paid to all such facilities were minimal. 
 Restrictions on Dividends and Risk-Based Capital 
 For information on Restrictions on Dividends and Risk-based Capital that affect us please refer to Note 11 ~ Statutory Financial Data, Risk-Based Capital and Dividend Restrictions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Regulatory and Rating Issues section within Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis . 
 NAIC-IRIS Ratios 
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System IRIS was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners. However, the generation of ratios outside of the usual values does not necessarily indicate a financial problem. For example, premium growth, alone, can trigger one or more unusual values. Refer to the Regulatory and Rating Issues section within Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis .

Effect of Federal Legislation 
 The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act TRIA was enacted in November 2002. After several extensions, Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization of 2015 Act ). The Act was extended through December 31, 2027 in December of 2019. The Act continues to require insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage. There is minimal exposure to this coverage as most of our policyholders decline this coverage option. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 109 employees. Substantially all of our employees are full-time. Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such an agreement. We believe we have good working relations with our employees.

Glossary 

Accident year 
 The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. 

Accident year combined ratio 
 The accident year combined ratio is an insurance industry measure that excludes changes in net ultimate loss estimates from prior accident year loss reserves. The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year s profitability (which matches policy pricing with related losses) and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written. Management uses accident year combined ratio as one component to assess the Company's current year performance and as a measure to evaluate, and if necessary, adjust current year pricing and underwriting. 

Adjusted operating income (loss) 
 Net income (loss) excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, the effects of tax reform, the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income, the change in the fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the capitalization and amortization of deferred gains from the adverse development cover (ADC). 

Adjusted operating income (loss), per share 
 Adjusted operating income (loss) on a per share basis. 

Assignment of Benefits 
 A legal tool that allows a third party to assert a claim and be paid for services performed for an insured who would normally be reimbursed directly by the insurance company after making a claim themselves. 

Book value per share 
 Total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. 

Case reserves 
 Estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific reported claim. 

Combined Ratio based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP 
 The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios differ from statutory ratios to reflect GAAP accounting, as management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations using the GAAP combined ratio. 

Combined Ratio based on statutory accounting practices SAP 
 The combined ratio based on SAP, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business. The combined ratio is a statutory accounting measurement, which represents the sum of (i) the ratio of losses and loss expenses to net earned premiums (loss ratio), plus (ii) the ratio of underwriting expenses to net written premiums (expense ratio). 

Combined Ratio (Overall) 
 When the combined ratio is under 100 , underwriting results are generally considered profitable; when the combined ratio is over 100 , underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable. 

Deferred policy acquisition costs 
 Primarily commissions and premium-related taxes that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new contracts and are deferred and amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Deficiency 
 With regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are insufficient to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as new information becomes available. 

13 

Expense Ratio 
 For GAAP, it is the ratio of GAAP underwriting expenses incurred to net earned premiums plus other income. For SAP, it is the ratio of Statutory underwriting expenses incurred to net written premiums. 

Incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves 
 Reserves for estimated losses and LAE that have been incurred but not yet reported to the insurer. This includes amounts for unreported claims, development on known cases, and re-opened claims. 

Lender 
 The Huntington National Bank 

Loss 
 An occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a claim. Losses may be covered, limited or excluded from coverage, depending on the terms of the policy. 

Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) 
 The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. 

Loss ratio 
 The ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums plus other income. 

Loss reserves 
 Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims incurred that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE, and consist of case reserves and IBNR reserves. As the term is used in this document, loss reserves is meant to include reserves for both losses and LAE, unless stated otherwise. 

Loss reserve development 
 The increase or decrease in Losses or LAE as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development. 

Losses incurred 
 The total losses sustained by an insurance company under a policy or policies, whether paid or unpaid. Incurred losses include a provision for IBNR. 

NAIC-IRIS ratios 
 Financial ratios calculated by the NAIC to assist state insurance departments in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. 

Policyholders' surplus 
 As determined under SAP, the amount remaining after all liabilities are subtracted from all admitted assets. Admitted assets are assets of an insurer prescribed or permitted by a state to be recognized on the statutory balance sheet. Policyholders' surplus is also referred to as surplus or statutory surplus for statutory accounting purposes. 

Premium leverage ratio 
 The ratio of written premium (gross or net) to consolidated statutory surplus. 

Redundancy 
 With regard to reserves for a given liability, a redundancy exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are greater than what will be needed to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the redundancy is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of redundancy (or even the finding of whether or not a redundancy exists) may change as new information becomes available. 

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) 
 A measure adopted by the NAIC and enacted by states for determining the minimum statutory policyholders' surplus requirements of insurers. Insurers having total adjusted capital less than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. 

Statutory accounting practices (SAP) 
 The practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by domiciliary state insurance regulatory authorities in the United States for recording transactions and preparing financial statements. 

Underwriting gain or loss 
 Net earned premiums plus other income, less losses, LAE, commissions, and operating expenses.

ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 Risk Factors 
 You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition in the future. 
 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. We have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us. These material risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Operational Risks 

Investment Risks 

Liquidity Risks 

Legal and Regulatory Risks 

Rating Agency Risks 

General Risk Factors 

Operational Risks 
 
 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and societal impact could adversely impact our businesses, assets and financial performance. 
 COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to public health, the global economy, financial markets, and commercial, social and community activity generally. The pandemic and the economic uncertainty may result in higher levels of loss and claims activity in certain lines of business and our premium revenue may reduce by a suppression of national and global commercial activity. If the ongoing pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, and continue to meet our liquidity needs. 
 
 Governmental, regulatory and judicial actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to conduct our businesses. 
 Insurance and financial regulators may attempt to impose new obligations on insurers in connection with the pandemic that could materially affect our business or profitability, including any retroactive change to the terms of existing insurance contracts that specifically exclude business interruption losses arising from the pandemic. While we believe that any retroactive attempt to rewrite the terms of existing contracts would be unconstitutional, we cannot be certain of ultimate judicial outcomes. In addition, there is a risk that novel litigation theories, in conjunction with a diverse range of potential jury and judicial venues across many jurisdictions, could give rise to unforeseen pandemic related liability. 
 
 The disruption and other effects caused by COVID-19 could adversely impact the efficiency and productivity of our Business operations. 
 To protect our employees and in response to the global and regional restrictions on interpersonal contact and travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of our work force is working remotely, placing increased demands on our IT systems. There is no assurance that our ability to continue to function in this new environment will not be adversely affected by an extended period of limited access to our physical facilities or by other developments such as an extended disruption in the telecommunications and internet infrastructure that support our remote work capability. 
 15 

Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Insurance companies financial condition and results of operations depend upon their ability to accurately assess the potential losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies they underwrite. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what the expected ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the current estimate. In the insurance industry, there is always the risk that reserves may prove inadequate as it is possible for insurance companies to underestimate the cost of claims. There has been considerable adverse development reported by the Company in recent years. 
 We base our estimates on our assessment of known facts and circumstances, as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events that could increase our exposure to losses, including changes in actuarial projections, claims handling procedures, inflation, severe weather, climate change, economic and judicial trends, and legislative changes. We continually monitor reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques to update our current estimate. Our estimates could prove to be inadequate, and this underestimation could have a material adverse effect on our financial strength. 
 The uncertainties we encounter in establishing our loss reserves include: 
 For the majority of our policies, we are obligated to pay any covered loss that occurs while the policy is in force. Accordingly, claims may be reported and develop many years after a policy has lapsed; 

Even when a claim is received, it may take considerable time to fully appreciate the extent of the covered loss suffered by the insured and, consequently, estimates of loss associated with specific claims can increase over time; 

New theories of liability are enforced retroactively from time to time by courts; 

Volatility in the financial markets, economic events, weather events and other external factors may result in an increase in the number of claims and the severity of the claims reported. In addition, elevated inflationary conditions would, among other things, drive loss costs to increase; 

When we enter new lines of business, or encounter new theories of claims liability, we may encounter an increase in claims frequency and greater claims handling costs than we had anticipated; and 

Estimation of IBNR losses is a complex and inherently uncertain process which involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise, which adds to the overall difficulty of estimating loss reserves. 

If any of our insurance reserves should prove to be inadequate for the reasons discussed above, or for any other reason, we will be required to increase reserves, resulting in a reduction in our net income and shareholders equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Such adverse development can result in the unplanned need for additional capital, which may need to be obtained through the sale of assets or additional issuance of common stock which could dilute current shareholder value. 
 If we are unable to underwrite risks accurately and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our policyholders, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 In general, the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of our underlying costs are known. Like other insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. Establishing adequate premium rates is necessary, together with investment income, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, LAE and other underwriting costs and to earn a profit. If we do not accurately assess the risks that we underwrite, we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our profitability. Alternatively, we could set our premiums too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues. 
 16 

Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. In order to accurately price our policies, we must: 
 Collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds; 

Develop, test and apply appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas; 

Closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and 

Project both frequency and severity of our insureds losses with reasonable accuracy. 

We seek to implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and, as a result, accurately price our policies, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: 
 Insufficient or unreliable data; 

Incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data; 

Uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions; 

Our failure to implement appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas or other pricing methodologies; 

Regulatory constraints on rate increases; and 

Our failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses, as well as unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action. 

In addition, as a result of current industry non-weather factors, such as the increase in litigation surrounding the Assignment of Benefits claims and lawsuits in Florida, in particular, we may experience additional losses that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to manage our growth effectively. 
 We intend to continue to grow our business, which could require additional capital, systems development and skilled personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate profitable business opportunities, meet our capital needs, expand our systems and our internal controls effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, identify qualified employees or agents or incorporate effectively the components of any businesses we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth. The failure to manage our growth effectively and maintain underwriting discipline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment and we may not continue to be able to compete effectively against larger or more well established business rivals. 
 We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and may enjoy better name recognition, substantially greater financial resources, higher financial strength ratings by rating agencies, broader and more diversified product lines and more widespread agency relationships than we do. Insurers in our markets generally compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition, coverages offered, claims handling, financial stability, customer service and geographic coverage. Although pricing is influenced to some degree by that of our competitors, it is not in our best interests to compete solely on price, and we may from time-to-time experience a loss of market share during periods of intense price competition. A number of new, proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry including, but not limited to: 
 An increase in capital raising by companies in our lines of business, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an excess of capital in the industry; 

The deregulation of commercial insurance lines in certain states and the possibility of federal regulatory reform of the insurance industry, which could increase competition from standard carriers for our E S lines of insurance business; and 

17 

Changing practices caused by the Internet may lead to greater competition in the insurance business. Among the possible changes are shifts in the way insurance is purchased. If our distribution model were to be significantly altered by changes in the way products are marketed, including, without limitation, through use of the Internet, it could have a material adverse effect on our premiums, underwriting results and profits. 

There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the insurance markets in which we participate. Increased competition in our market could result in a change in the supply and/or demand for insurance, affect our ability to price our products at risk adequate rates and retain existing business, or underwrite new business on favorable terms. If this increased competition so limits our ability to transact business, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crimes pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. 
 Our business is dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems. We rely upon our systems, as well as the systems of our vendors, to underwrite and process our business; make claim payments; provide customer service; provide policy administration services, such as endorsements, cancellations and premium collections; comply with insurance regulatory requirements; and perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. 
 Our systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Information technology security threats from user error to cybersecurity attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. We could also be subject to fines and penalties related to a security breach. The cost to remedy a severe breach could be substantial. 
 Severe weather conditions and other catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition. 
 Our property insurance business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including natural events such as hurricanes, winter weather, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, fires and other non-natural events such as explosions or riots. 
 The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Severe weather conditions and catastrophes can cause greater losses in our property lines and cause our liquidity and financial condition to deteriorate. In addition, our inability to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable rates and in amounts adequate to mitigate the risks associated with severe weather conditions and other catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable prices or on terms that provide us adequate protection. 
 We purchase reinsurance in many of our lines of business to help manage our exposure to insurance risks that we underwrite and to reduce volatility in our results. 
 The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity, each of which can affect our business volume and profitability. The availability of reasonably affordable reinsurance is a critical element of our business plan. One important way we utilize reinsurance is to reduce volatility in claims payments by limiting our exposure to losses from large risks. Another way we use reinsurance is to purchase 
 18 

substantial protection against concentrated losses when we enter new markets. As a result, our ability to manage volatility and avoid significant losses, expand into new markets or grow by offering insurance to new kinds of enterprises may be limited by the unavailability of reasonably priced reinsurance. We may not be able to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms or from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. Under such circumstances, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, which would reduce our revenues. 
 Many reinsurance companies have begun to exclude certain coverages from, or alter terms in, the reinsurance contracts we enter into with them. Some exclusions relate to risks that we cannot exclude from the policies we write due to business or regulatory constraints. In addition, reinsurers are imposing terms, such as lower per occurrence and aggregate limits, on direct insurers that do not wholly cover the risks written. As a result, we, like other direct insurance companies, write insurance policies which, to some extent, do not have the benefit of reinsurance protection. These gaps in reinsurance protection expose us to greater risk and greater potential losses. For example, certain reinsurers have excluded coverage for terrorist acts or priced such coverage at unreasonably high rates. 
 We distribute our insurance products through a select group of agents, several of which account for a significant portion of our business, and there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue, or if they do continue, that the relationship will be on favorable terms to us. In addition, reliance on agents subjects us to their credit risk. 
 Our distribution model depends almost entirely on the agencies that distribute our products. In 2022, six independent agencies accounted for approximately 42 of our gross written premiums in our commercial lines, and four independent agencies, accounted for approximately 45 of our gross written premiums in our personal lines. We cannot assure you that these relationships, or our relationships with any of our agencies will continue. Even if the relationships do continue, they may not be on terms that are profitable for us. The termination of a relationship with one or more significant agents could result in lower premium revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business prospects. 
 Certain premiums from policyholders, where the business is produced by agents, are collected directly by the agents and forwarded to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. In certain jurisdictions, when the insured pays its policy premium to these agents for payment on behalf of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, the premiums might be considered to have been paid under applicable insurance laws and regulations. Accordingly, the insured would no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from that agent. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with agents. There may be instances where agents collect premiums but do not remit them to us and we may be required to provide the coverage set forth in the policy despite the absence of premiums. If we are unable to collect premiums from agents, underwriting profits may decline and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 The property and casualty insurance business is historically cyclical in nature, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates, which could adversely affect our business. 
 Historically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, adverse litigation trends, regulatory constraints, general economic conditions and other factors. The supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of capital available to the industry that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry. As a result, the insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity increased premium levels. Demand for insurance depends on numerous factors, including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, the introduction of new capital providers, and general economic conditions. All of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the insurance industry. 
 We cannot predict with certainty whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to underwrite insurance at rates we consider appropriate and commensurate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot underwrite insurance at appropriate rates, our ability to transact business will be materially and adversely affected. Any of these factors could lead to an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 19 

Adverse economic factors, including recession, inflation, periods of high unemployment or lower economic activity could result in the sale of fewer policies than expected or an increase in the infrequency or severity of claims and premium defaults or both, which, in turn, could affect our growth and profitability. 
 Factors, such as business revenue, economic conditions, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation can all affect the business and economic environment in which we operate. These same factors affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. In an economic downturn that is characterized by higher unemployment, declining spending and reduced corporate revenues, the demand for insurance products is adversely affected, which directly affects our premium levels and profitability. Negative economic factors may also affect our ability to receive the appropriate rate for the risk we insure with our policyholders and may adversely affect the number of policies we can write, including with respect to our opportunities to underwrite profitable business. In an economic downturn, our customers may have less need for insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify their coverage or not renew with us. Existing policyholders may exaggerate or even falsify claims to obtain higher claims payments. These outcomes would reduce our underwriting profit to the extent these factors are not reflected in the rates we charge. 
 The failure of any of the loss limitations or exclusions we employ, or changes in other claims or coverage issues, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our policies include provisions to limit our exposure to known risks. In addition, we design our policy terms to manage our exposure to expanding theories of legal liability like those which have given rise to claims for lead paint, asbestos, mold, construction defects and environmental matters. Many of the policies we issue also include conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and entitle us to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. Also, many of our policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy, which in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which such claims can be brought against our policyholders. 
 As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond the underwriting intent or by increasing the size or number of claims. 
 It is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void any number of the provisions we put in place to limit our exposure. Regulatory authorities or courts may not interpret the limitations or exclusions that we included in the policies in the manner we intended. Or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations. These types of governmental actions could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. 
 If we are unable to retain key management and employees or recruit other qualified personnel, we may be adversely affected. 
 We believe that our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees, particularly our chairman and chief executive officer, James G. Petcoff. There can be no assurance that we can attract and retain the necessary employees to conduct our business activities on a timely basis or at all. Our competitors may offer more favorable compensation arrangements to our key management or employees to incentivize them to leave our Company. Furthermore, our competitors may make it more difficult for us to hire their personnel by offering excessive compensation arrangements to certain employees to induce them not to leave their current employment and bringing litigation against employees who do leave (and possibly us as well) to join us. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel as we grow, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, and could prevent us from fully implementing our growth strategies. 
 20 

We rely on our systems and employees, and those of certain third party vendors and service providers in conducting our operations, and certain failures, including internal or external fraud, operational errors, or systems malfunctions, could materially adversely affect our operations. 
 We are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and recordkeeping errors and computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Our business depends on our ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of our operational, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. Similarly, we depend on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or intentional sabotage or fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. 
 Third parties with whom we do business, including vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns, failures, or capacity constraints of their own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate our business, or cause financial loss, potential liability to insureds, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage or regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect us. 
 Litigation and legal proceedings against our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 As an insurance holding company, our Subsidiaries are named as defendants in various legal actions in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the outcome of presently pending matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, operating results or liquidity. However, the outcomes of lawsuits cannot be predicted and, if determined adversely, could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
 Our geographic concentration ties our performance to the business, economic, natural perils, man-made perils, and regulatory conditions within our most concentrated region. 
 Our revenues and profitability are subject to the prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, political, demographic, competitive, weather and other conditions in the principal states in which we do business. Changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in such states and would have a more pronounced effect on us compared to companies that are more geographically diversified. In addition, our exposure to severe losses from localized perils, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wind, ice storms, hail, fires, terrorism, riots and explosions, is increased in those areas where we have written significant numbers of insurance policies. 
 We are subject to credit risk with regard to our reinsurance counterparties. 
 Although reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the risk ceded, we are not relieved of our primary liability to our insureds as the direct insurer. We cannot be sure that our reinsurers will pay all reinsurance claims on a timely basis or at all. For example, reinsurers may default in their financial obligations to us as the result of insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud, asserted defenses based on agreement wordings or the principle of utmost good faith, asserted deficiencies in the documentation of agreements or other reasons. The failure of a reinsurer to pay us does not lessen our contractual obligations to insureds. If a reinsurer fails to pay the expected portion of a claim or claims, our net losses might increase substantially and adversely affect our financial condition. Any disputes with reinsurers regarding coverage under reinsurance contracts could be time consuming, costly and uncertain of success. 
 Downgrades to the credit ratings of our reinsurance counterparties may result in the reduction of rating agency capital credit provided by those reinsurance contracts and could, therefore, result in a downgrade of our own credit ratings. We evaluate each reinsurance claim based on the facts of the case, historical experience with the reinsurer on similar claims and existing case law and include any amounts deemed uncollectible from the reinsurer in our reserve for uncollectible reinsurance. 
 21 

Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our reputation is one of our key assets. Our ability to attract and retain policyholders is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters, including from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation. Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence among existing and potential policyholders, regulators and other parties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new policyholders and maintain existing ones, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Investment Risks 
 Our investment portfolio is subject to significant market and credit risks, which could result in an adverse impact on our financial conditions or results of operations. 
 Our results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investment portfolio. We seek to hold a diversified portfolio of investments that is managed by professional investment advisory management firms in accordance with our investment policy and routinely reviewed by our Investment Committee. However, our investments are subject to general economic conditions and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities. 
 The value of our investment portfolio is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held, or due to deterioration in the financial condition of an entity that guarantees an issuer s payments of such investments. Such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. 
 A severe economic downturn could cause us to incur substantial realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, debt and financial strength ratings, Insurance Company Subsidiaries capital liquidity and ability to access capital markets. In addition, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate the adverse effect of the losses on us. 
 We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes . 
 Our investment portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income securities. These securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. An increase in interest rates typically reduces the fair market value of fixed income securities. In addition, if interest rates decline, investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower. Rising interest rates could result in a significant reduction of our book value. A low investment yield environment could adversely impact our net earnings, as a result of fixed income securities maturing and being replaced with lower yielding securities which impact investing results. 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control including general economic conditions, governmental monetary policy, and political conditions. See Item 7A ~ Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion on interest rate risk. 
 Liquidity Risks 
 Any debt service obligations will reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating to our current and future indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 24.4 million of senior unsecured notes (the Notes outstanding and 10.5 million of subordinated notes (the Subordinated Notes outstanding. The Company's line of credit matured on December 1, 2022, and was not renewed. See Note 9 ~ Debt for additional details. We are subject to risks typically associated with debt financing, such as insufficient cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness. The Notes are due on September 30, 2023. 
 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt 
 22 

and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. In addition, the Subordinated Notes contain various restrictive covenants that relate to the Company s tangible net worth, fixed-charge coverage ratios, dividend paying capacity, reinsurance retentions, and risk-based capital ratios. If we are unable to meet debt covenant requirements or to obtain future waivers regarding such failures, we could be in breach of our credit agreement. Any such breach could cause significant disruption to our operations, including a requirement to immediately repay our indebtedness, and would have severe adverse effects on our liquidity and financial flexibility. 
 Our ability to meet ongoing cash requirements, service debt and pay dividends may be limited by our holding company structure and regulatory constraints restricting dividends or other distributions by our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. 
 We are a holding company that transacts the majority of our business through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries and, as a result, our principal sources of funds are payments from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, including intercompany service fees and dividends. Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and pay our expenses, depends on continuing to receive sufficient funds from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. We have met our outstanding cash flow obligations at the holding company level primarily through intercompany service fees we receive as well as direct expense reimbursements. We may also use dividends from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, however, insurance regulations limit such dividend payments. At this time any dividend payment from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries would need prior regulatory approval. Any significant reduction in the intercompany service fees we receive, and any regulatory or other limitations on the payment of dividends to us from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, may adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and pay our expenses. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 As a holding company which owns insurance companies domiciled in the United States, we and our admitted Insurance Company Subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, primarily by Michigan (the domiciliary state for CIC and WPIC) and to a lesser degree, the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. These regulations generally are administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, authorizations to write certain lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, reserve requirements, rate and form approvals, investment and underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions, dividend limitations, cancellation and non renewal of policies, changes in control, solvency and a variety of other financial and non financial aspects of our business. These laws and regulations are regularly re examined and any changes in these laws and regulations or new laws may be more restrictive, could make it more expensive to conduct business or otherwise adversely affect our operations. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may impose timing and expense or other constraints that could adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. 
 In addition, regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe are generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
 The admitted market is subject to more state regulation than the E S market, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various 
 23 

state associations, such as guaranty associations. Some states have deregulated their commercial insurance markets. We cannot predict the effect that further deregulation would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The State of Michigan has adopted the NAIC s calculation to measure the adequacy of statutory capital of U.S. based insurers, known as RBC. The RBC calculation establishes the minimum amount of capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure to maintain adequate RBC at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct their business. 
 The State of Michigan has adopted the NAIC s holding company act and regulations. This act requires, among other things, that: 
 An insurance holding company system s ultimate controlling person submit an annual enterprise risk report to its domiciliary state insurance regulator which identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that may have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole, 

A controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control, and 

Insurers comply with certain minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between the insurer and its affiliates. 

The State of Michigan also adopted the NAIC s Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the ORSA Model Act ). The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurance holding company system s Chief Risk Officer to submit annually to its domiciliary regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report ORSA ). The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with the insurer s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. The Company is currently exempt from providing an ORSA summary report as it does not meet the minimum premium requirements. We may be required to comply with this requirement in the future if our gross written premium exceeds 500 million annually. 
 We cannot predict the impact these requirements or any other regulatory requirements may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements. Failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action. 
 Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile and each state in which they issue policies. As of December 31, 2022, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in compliance with all such reserves. Any failure by one of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements will subject it to corrective action. This may include requiring the adoption of a comprehensive financial plan, revocation of its license to sell insurance products or placing the subsidiary under state regulatory control. It may also result in our Insurance Company Subsidiaries being limited in their ability to make a dividend to us and could be a factor in causing rating agencies to downgrade our ratings. Any new minimum capital and surplus requirements adopted in the future may require us to increase the capital and surplus of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, which we may not be able to do. 
 We may become subject to additional government or market regulation which may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 Market disruptions like those experienced during the credit driven financial market collapse in 2008, as well as the dramatic increase in the capital allocated to alternative asset management during recent years, have led to increased governmental as well as self regulatory scrutiny of the insurance industry in general. In addition, certain legislation proposing greater regulation of the industry is periodically considered by governing bodies of some jurisdictions. 
 Our business could be adversely affected by changes in state laws, including those relating to asset and reserve valuation requirements, surplus requirements, limitations on investments and dividends, enterprise risk and RBC requirements and, at 
 24 

the federal level, by laws and regulations that may affect certain aspects of the insurance industry, including proposals for preemptive federal regulation. The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may affect the insurance industry, including tort reform and corporate governance. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act also established the Federal Insurance Office, which is authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the insurance industry and to recommend that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to U.S. financial stability in the event of the insurer s material financial distress or failure. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office issued a report on alternatives to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. Any additional regulations established as a result of the Dodd Frank Act or actions in response to the Federal Insurance Office Report could increase our costs of compliance or lead to disciplinary action. In addition, legislation has been introduced from time to time that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry, including federal licensing in addition to or in lieu of state licensing and reinsurance for natural catastrophes. We are unable to predict whether any legislation will be enacted or any regulations will be adopted, or the effect any such developments could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 It is impossible to predict what, if any, changes in the regulations applicable to us, the markets in which we operate, trade and invest or the counterparties with which we do business may be instituted in the future. Any such regulation could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 The effect of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business is uncertain. 
 As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. 
 
 Rating Agency Risks 
 A decline in our financial strength rating may result in a reduction of new or renewal business. 
 Participants in the insurance industry use ratings from independent ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best Company, Inc. A.M. Best and Kroll Bond Rating Agency Kroll as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. In setting their ratings, A.M. Best and Kroll utilize a quantitative and qualitative analysis of a company s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. These analyses include comparisons to peers and industry standards as well as assessments of operating plans, philosophy and management. For A.M. Best, the ratings range from A++, or superior, to F for in liquidation. Kroll's ratings range from AAA (extremely strong) to R (under regulatory supervision). As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, A.M. Best has assigned financial strength ratings of B+ with a stable outlook for CIC and WPIC. A rating of B+ means A.M. Best considers both companies to have a good ability to meet ongoing financial obligations. Kroll has given CIC and WPIC an insurance financial strength rating of BBB+ with a stable outlook as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A BBB+ rating indicates that the insurer's financial condition is adequate. 
 A.M. Best and Kroll assign ratings that are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurance company s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and such ratings are not evaluations directed to investors. A.M. Best and Kroll periodically review our ratings and may revise ratings downward or revoke them at their sole discretion based primarily on their analyses of our balance sheet strength (including capital adequacy and loss and loss adjustment expense reserve adequacy), operating performance and business profile. Factors that could affect such analyses include but are not limited to: 
 If unfavorable financial, regulatory or market trends affect us, including excess market capacity; 

If we incur operating losses or significant investment portfolio losses; 

If we have unresolved issues with government regulators; 

25 

If we are unable to retain our senior management or other key personnel; 

If A.M. Best or Kroll alters its capital adequacy assessment methodology in a manner that would adversely affect our rating. 

In addition, with a heightened level of scrutiny placed on many financial institutions (including insurance companies) in recent years, rating agencies may increase the capital and other requirements to maintain certain ratings levels. These and other factors could result in a downgrade of our rating. A downgrade of our rating could cause our current and future agents, retail brokers and insureds to choose other, more highly rated competitors. A downgrade of this rating could also increase the cost or reduce the availability of reinsurance to us. A downgrade or withdrawal of any rating could severely limit or prevent us from writing new and renewal insurance contracts and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to assessments and other surcharges from state guaranty funds, and mandatory state insurance facilities, which may reduce our profitability. 
 Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries are subject to assessments in most states where we are licensed for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies. These assessments are levied by guaranty associations within the state in proportion to the premiums written by member insures in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer was engaged. Maximum contributions required by law in any one year vary by state, and have historically been less than one percent of annual premiums written. We cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments because they depend on factors outside our control, such as insolvencies of other insurance companies. Significant assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 The price of our common stock may be volatile and limited public float and low trading volume for our shares may have an adverse impact on the share price or make it difficult to liquidate. 
 The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could be significant and could cause a loss in the amount invested in our shares of common stock. 
 In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for insurance companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. At times, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 As a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price or may not be able to resell them at all. These market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and the trading volume of our common stock remain low. 
 We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or available only on unfavorable terms. 
 Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to grow premium volume and underwrite the business profitably. To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient, we may need to raise additional capital in the future through offerings of debt or equity securities or otherwise to: 
 Fund liquidity needs caused by underwriting or investment losses; 

Replace capital lost in the event of significant losses or adverse reserve development; 

Satisfy letters of credit or guarantee bond requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators; 

26 

Meet rating agency or regulatory capital requirements; or 

Respond to competitive pressures. 

Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute your ownership interest in the Company and may cause the value of our shares to decline. Additional capital raised through the issuance of debt may result in creditors having rights, preferences and privileges senior or otherwise superior to those of the holders of our shares and may limit our flexibility in operating our business and make it more difficult to obtain capital in the future. Disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. If we are not able to obtain adequate capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 We cannot assure you that we will declare or pay dividends on our common shares in the future so any returns may be limited to the value of our stock. 
 We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to appreciation in value of their stock, if any. 
 In addition, any determination to declare or pay future dividends to our shareholders will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on a variety of factors, including (1) our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including our ability to generate cash flow in excess of expenses and our expected or actual net income), retained earnings and collateral and capital requirements, (2) general business conditions, (3) legal, tax and regulatory limitations, (4) contractual prohibitions and other restrictions, (5) the effect of a dividend or dividends upon our financial strength ratings and (6) any other factors that our Board deems relevant. 
 Our principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our executive officers, directors, 5 shareholders and their affiliates owned approximately 69.3 of our voting stock. Therefore, these shareholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position. These shareholders may be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval. For example, these shareholders may be able to significantly influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our shareholders. 
 We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to related compliance initiatives. 
 As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC, annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of Nasdaq and provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which imposes significant compliance obligations upon us. 
 The Sarbanes Oxley Act and the Dodd Frank Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, have increased regulation of, and imposed enhanced disclosure and corporate governance requirements on, public companies. Our efforts to comply with these laws, regulations and standards have increased our operating costs and may divert management s time and attention from revenue generating activities. 
 Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. 
 27 

Certain provisions of our corporate governance documents and Michigan law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price. 
 Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors (our Board ). These include provisions that, among other things: 
 Permit the Board to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may determine (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in control); 

Provide that the authorized number of directors may be fixed only by the Board in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws; 

Do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election); 

Provide that all vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 

Prohibit removal of directors without cause; 

Prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; 

Requires unanimous consent for shareholders to take action by written consent without approval of the action by our Board; 

Provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide advance notice in writing and also comply with specified requirements related to the form and content of a shareholder s notice; 

Require at least 80 supermajority shareholder approval to alter, amend or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation; and 

Require at least 80 supermajority shareholder approval in order for shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws. 

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of the Board, which is responsible for appointing members of our management. 
 In addition, our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan permits the Board or a committee thereof to accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to outstanding equity awards, in the event of, or immediately prior to, a change in control. Such vesting or acceleration could discourage the acquisition of our Company. 
 We could also become subject to certain anti takeover provisions under Michigan law which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not an acquisition or merger is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. If a corporation s board of directors chooses to opt in to certain provisions of Michigan Law, such corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 of the corporation s outstanding voting shares unless the holder has held the shares for five years or more or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the business combination. Our Board has not elected to be subject to this provision, but could do so in the future. Any provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws or Michigan law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock otherwise. 
 28 

Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt, including making principal and interest payments on the Notes and the Subordinated Notes, may be limited by our holding company structure and regulatory constraints restricting dividends or other distributions by our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. 
 We are a holding company that transacts the majority of our business through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries and, as a result, our principal sources of funds are payments from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, including intercompany service fees and dividends. Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt obligations, including making principal and interest payments on the Notes, depends on continuing to receive sufficient funds from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. We have met our outstanding debt obligations primarily through intercompany service fees we receive. We may also use dividends from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, however, insurance regulations limit such dividend payments. Dividend payments may be further constrained by rating agency capital requirements or other business considerations. As a result, our ability to use dividends as a source of funds to meet our debt obligations may be significantly limited. Any significant reduction in the intercompany service fees we receive, and any regulatory and other limitations on the payment of dividends to us by our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, may adversely affect our ability to pay interest on the Notes as it comes due and the principal of the Notes at their maturity. 
 Although the Notes are currently listed on Nasdaq, the trading market for the Notes may be limited, which could affect the market price of the Notes or your ability to sell them. 
 Although the Notes are currently listed on Nasdaq, we cannot provide any assurances that it will remain on Nasdaq or that an active trading market will exist for the Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes. The Notes may trade at a discount to their face value depending on access to markets, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. We cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will be available for the Notes, that you will be able to sell the Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not exist, the liquidity and trading price for the Notes may be harmed. 
 If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes. 
 Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including other indebtedness to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under any other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 There are limited covenants in the Indenture relating to our Notes. 
 In addition to our currently outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, the Indenture does not restrict us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including additional senior debt or secured debt under our secured credit facilities. If we incur additional debt or liabilities, our ability to pay the obligations on the Notes could be adversely affected. 
 Our indebtedness, including the indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur in the future, could have important consequences for the holders of the Notes, including: 
 limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; 

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

29 

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements; 

requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements; and 

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; and putting us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less indebtedness. 

In addition, we have limited restrictions under the Indenture from granting security interests in our assets, paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing securities. 
 Moreover, the Indenture does not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity and, accordingly, does not protect holders of the Notes in the event that we experience material adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations. Holders of the Notes have limited protection under the Indenture in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, default under our existing indebtedness, restructuring, merger or similar transaction. 
 For these reasons, you should not consider the covenants in the Indenture a significant factor in evaluating whether to invest in the Notes. 
 The Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
 The Notes are obligations exclusively of Conifer Holdings, Inc. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the Notes and the Notes are not guaranteed by any subsidiary we may acquire or create in the future. Any assets of our subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. Our subsidiaries may incur substantial indebtedness in the future, all of which would be structurally senior to the Notes. 
 Volatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock could adversely impact the trading price of the Notes. 
 The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section or any number of our financial filings or disclosures or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. A decrease in the market price of our common stock could adversely impact the trading price of the Notes. 
 We may redeem the Notes before maturity, and holders of the redeemed Notes may be unable to reinvest the proceeds at the same or a higher rate of return. 
 We may redeem all or a portion of the Notes. If redemption does occur, holders of the redeemed Notes may be unable to reinvest the money received in the redemption at a rate that is equal to or higher than the rate of return on the Notes.

Neither Michigan law nor our amended and restated articles of incorporation requires our board of directors to declare dividends on our common stock. Conifer Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that has no substantial revenues of its own, and relies primarily on intercompany service fees, cash dividends or distributions from its subsidiaries to pay operating expenses, service debts, and pay dividends to shareholders. The payment of dividends by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries is limited under the laws and regulations of their respective state of domicile. These regulations stipulate the maximum amount of annual dividends or other distributions available to shareholders without prior approval of the relevant regulatory authorities. Any future determination to declare cash dividends on our common stock will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. The Parent Company has not historically paid dividends and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future. 
 32 

For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
 Shareholders of Record 
 As of March 27, 2023, there were 27 shareholders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of holders are beneficial owners whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other nominees. 
 Repurchases of Company's Stock 
 On December 5, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to one million shares of the Company's common stock. Shares may be purchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program may be terminated or suspended at any time, at the discretion of the Company. The Company may in the future enter into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to effect a portion of the authorized purchases, if criteria set forth in the plan are met. Such a plan would enable the Company to repurchase its shares during periods outside of its normal trading windows, when the Company typically would not be active in the market. The timing of purchases, and the exact number of any shares to be purchased, will depend on market conditions. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables. The company did not repurchase any shares of stock for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the stock repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 1,968 shares of stock valued at approximately 4,000 related to the vesting of the Company s restricted stock units. Upon the repurchase of the Company's shares, the shares remain authorized, but not issued or outstanding. 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 In August 2022, the Company issued 5.0 million of common equity through a private placement of 2,500,000 shares priced at 2.00 per share. The participants in the private placement consisted of members of the Company's Board of Directors. 
 No underwriters were involved in the foregoing sale of securities. The issuances of the securities described above were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.

(1) Regulatory and capital surplus is the excess of assets over liabilities of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries and is determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles as determined by the domiciliary state for each Insurance Company Subsidiary. In 2018, CIC issued a surplus note to WPIC for 10.0 million. The 10.0 million surplus note is eliminated from the combined regulatory capital and surplus balance as of December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

 Recent Developments 
 COVID-19 
 COVID-19 (the Pandemic caused significant disruption to public health, the global economy, financial markets, and commercial, social and community activity in general. As there has been a significant reduction in reported cases and correspondingly a reduction in government restrictions, we see reduced risk to our business. We continue to monitor potential risks the Pandemic may present including a potential resurgence. Our exposure to the Pandemic is manifold. The majority of our employees continue to work remotely however strict shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders have been lifted. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the hospitality sector within the U.S. which remains under stress due to the threats of resurgence and resource shortages that resulted from the Pandemic. 
 We have continued to provide customer service, process new and renewal business, handle claims and otherwise manage all operations even though the vast majority of the staff is working remotely. To date, we have not seen a major disruption in our business as a result of the Pandemic and currently do not expect to see a material negative impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of the Pandemic. 
 VSRM Transaction 
 Prior to October 13, 2022, Sycamore owned 50 of Venture Agency Holdings, Inc. Venture and has accounted for its ownership under the equity method of accounting. On October 13, 2022, Sycamore purchased the other 50 of Venture from an individual for 9.7 million. Following this purchase, Sycamore owned 100 of Venture, which was then renamed to VSRM, Inc. VSRM ). VRSM and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, The Roots Insurance Agency, Inc. Roots and Mitzel Insurance Agency, Inc. Mitzel were incorporated into the Company's consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. 
 The Company recognized Sycamore's purchase of the individual's shares of VSRM as a step acquisition and revalued all assets and liabilities upon the acquisition date. This resulted in the recognition of an 8.8 million non-operating gain reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Gain from VSRM Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company also utilized 12.5 million of federal tax net operating losses carried forward and 14.8 million state tax net operating losses 
 36 

carried forward, for a net-of-tax benefit of 9.4 million. VSRM retained 8.9 million of debt, and 9.4 million of tax liabilities, as well as other smaller assets and liabilities that did not go with the transaction. 
 The fair value of the equity interest of VSRM immediately prior to the acquisition by Sycamore was 10.1 million. The fair value techniques used to measure the fair value of VSRM included using the carrying value of all current assets and liabilities as their carrying values approximated their fair values. Intangible assets were reviewed based on recent valuations performed by third party valuation experts and the net realized proceeds received upon the sale of the Security Alarm Business sold the following day. 
 On October 14, 2022, VSRM sold all of its security guard and alarm installation insurance brokerage business (the Security Alarm Business to a third party insurance brokerage firm for 38.2 million. As part of the transaction, the individual who previously owned 50 of VSRM transitioned employment to the buyer, along with a team of approximately eight other employees of VSRM. The Company recognized this transaction as the sale of a business. Because all assets and liabilities were just adjusted to fair value from the step acquisition described above, the basis of the net assets sold equaled the net proceeds from the sale, thus there was no gain recognized upon the sale of the Security Alarm Business. 
 On December 30, 2022, VSRM contributed its remaining business, including its two wholly owned subsidiaries (Mitzel and Roots) to a new wholly owned subsidiary, Sycamore Specialty Underwriters, LLC SSU ). The business contributed to SSU consisted of customer accounts of substantially all of the personal lines business and a small subset of the commercial lines business underwritten by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries, and all of the customer accounts VSRM produced for third-party insurers, other than the security guard and alarm installation brokerage business previously sold. 
 On December 31, 2022, Andrew D. Petcoff purchased 50 of SSU from VSRM, Inc. for 1,000. As a result, SSU and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Roots and Mitzel, are no longer consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, and VSRM's investment in SSU is accounted for using the equity method. The net assets transferred to SSU had a fair value of 0 at the time of the contribution. There was no gain or loss recognized upon the sale of half of SSU to Mr. Petcoff. Included in the net assets transferred to SSU was a 1.0 million promissory note payable, a liability that was assumed by SSU. The note payable was an obligation that originated as part of the Venture Transaction described below, and is payable to CIC. 
 In order to determine the value of the portion of the business contributed to SSU, the Company obtained a third party valuation based on a weighting of discounted cash flows and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple valuation methods. The valuation included significant estimates and assumptions related to (i) forecasted revenue and EBITDA and (ii) the selection of the EBITDA multiple and discount rate. 
 Sale of Certain Agency Business 
 On June 30, 2021, Sycamore sold to Venture Agency Holdings, Inc., a related party, the customer accounts and other related assets of some of its personal and commercial lines of business (the Venture Transaction ). Sycamore will continue to produce various personal and commercial lines that it did not sell which is substantially all produced for, and underwritten by, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. We recognized an 8.9 million gain on the sale which is reflected in Other Gains in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In order to determine the value of the portion of the business sold, the Company obtained a third party valuation based on a weighting of discounted cash flows and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple valuation methods. The valuation included significant estimates and assumptions related to (i) forecasted revenue and EBITDA and (ii) the selection of the EBITDA multiple and discount rate. 
 The purchase price was 10.0 million of which 1.0 million was paid in cash on June 30, 2021, and 9.0 million was in the form of two promissory notes (one for 6.0 million and one for 3.0 million). Both notes require interest-only quarterly payments at a per annum rate of 7.0 , with a five-year maturity. There are no prepayment penalties. On December 14, 2021, Venture paid off the 3.0 million note. On October 20, 2022, Venture paid down 5.0 million of the 6.0 million note. 
 37 

The remaining 1.0 million promissory note was assumed by SSU as part of the contribution of business to SSU described above. 
 The assets sold included the customer accounts (mainly agency-related new and renewal rights) of substantially all of the personal lines business and a small subset of the commercial lines business underwritten by our Insurance Company Subsidiaries, and all of the customer accounts Sycamore produced for third-party insurers. The Venture Transaction included the transition of 21 employees from Conifer to Venture as well as necessary systems and office functions to operate the business. Venture did not assume any in-force business or liabilities. The business transitioned to Venture as it produced new or renewal business effective July 1, 2021. Our Insurance Company Subsidiaries continued to underwrite substantially all of the business we sold to Venture that we underwrote prior to the transaction. 
 
 Loss Portfolio Transfer 
 On November 1, 2022, the Company entered into a loss portfolio transfer LPT reinsurance agreement with Fleming Reinsurance Ltd Fleming Re ). Under the agreement, Fleming Re will cover an aggregate limit of 66.3 million of paid losses on 40.8 million of stated net reserves as of June 30, 2022, relating to accident years 2019 and prior. This covers substantially all of the commercial liability lines underwritten by the Company. Within the aggregate limit, there is a 5.5 million loss corridor in which the Company retains losses in excess of 40.8 million. Fleming Re is then responsible to cover paid losses in excess of 46.3 million up to 66.3 million. Accordingly, there is 20.0 million of adverse development cover for accident years 2019 and prior. Under the agreement, Fleming Re was paid 40.8 million for stated net reserves as of June 30, 2022, plus a one-time risk fee of 5.4 million. Recoverables due to the Company under this agreement are recorded as reinsurance recoverables. The agreement is between CIC and WPIC and Fleming Re. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded losses through the 5.5 million corridor and 644,000 into the 20.0 million layer. 
 The Company paid 25.0 million in cash on October 14, 2022, which was netted down for claims paid through September 30, 2022 and 13.6 million of funds withheld. Cash used in the transaction was generated from the existing investment portfolios held by CIC and WPIC. 
 
 A.M. Best 
 On April 21, 2022, A.M. Best downgraded the Company s Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) from bb (Fair) to bb- (Fair), and downgraded the Company s insurance subsidiaries Financial Strength Rating from B++ (Good) to B+ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR from bbb (Good) to bbb- (Good). The outlook assigned to all these ratings by A.M. Best was Stable. We do not believe the rating changes will have a material effect on our business. 
 Business Overview 
 We are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 45 states, including the District of Columbia. We are licensed to write insurance as an admitted carrier in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states. 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write. 
 Our expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in three insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines, personal lines, and agency business. Together, the commercial and personal lines refer to underwriting operations that take insurance risk, and the agency business refers to non-risk insurance business. 
 38 

Through our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis. 
 Through our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance product line is primarily comprised of low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we offer in Illinois, Indiana and Texas. 
 Through our wholesale agency business segment, we offer commercial and personal lines insurance products for our Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as third-party insurers. The wholesale agency business segment provides our agents with more insurance product options. However, as a result of the sale of certain agency business on June 30, 2021, going forward, our agency segment will not be producing any significant amounts of business for third party insurers and will produce approximately 50 less business for the Insurance Company Subsidiaries. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 General 
 We identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details. 
 Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves 
 Our recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses LAE reserves represent management s best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of: 
 Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been reported; and 

Incurred but not reported IBNR reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development on case reserves. 

We do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money. 
 Case reserves are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim. Our claims department updates their case basis valuations upon receipt of additional information and reduces case reserves as claims are paid. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors: 
 The type of loss; 

The severity of injury or damage; 

Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim; 

The jurisdiction of the occurrence; 

Policy provisions related to the claim; 

39 

Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and 

Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim. 

IBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves and paid loss and LAE from the estimated ultimate loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review Committee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE. 
 We use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including: 
 Written and earned premiums; 

Paid and reported losses and LAE; 

Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and 

Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable. 

The principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include: 
 Loss ratio method This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year; 

Loss development methods Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date; 

Bornheutter Ferguson method This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and 

Frequency/severity method This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products. 

Our actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates. 
 Our actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year. 
 Our actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense 
 40 

ULAE reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date. 
 We allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet. 
 The estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to: 
 Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known; 

Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency; 

Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and 

Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions. 

Most or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised. 
 Our reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly. 
 The following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands):

Included in the reinsurance recoverables were reinsurance recoverables from the LPT which were 24.4 million of reinsurance recoverables on case reserves and 1.5 million of reinsurance recoverables on IBNR. All of the reinsurance recoverables from the LPT are included in commercial lines. 
 Although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations. 
 41 

Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors. 
 We generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10 for the most recent accident year, 5 for the preceding accident year, and 2.5 for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years maturity. 
 The following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2022. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2022 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders equity at December 31, 2022. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year s reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. The shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 21 , however due to the net operating losses NOL available to use against taxable income and the offsetting valuation allowance, there is no difference between pre-tax income and shareholders equity in this schedule. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.

 Investment Valuation and Impairment 
 We carry debt securities classified as available for sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in net income. We carry other equity investments that do not have a readily 
 42 

determinable fair value at cost, less impairment and adjusted for observable price changes under the measurement alternative provided under GAAP. We review these investments for impairment during each reporting period. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held to maturity. 
 We evaluate our available for sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other than temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other than temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss. 
 We consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other than temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer s near term prospects. In addition, for debt securities, we consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis. 
 Fair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements . The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company s best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. The Company also has investment company limited partnership investments, which are measured at net asset value (NAV). The fair value of these investments is based on the capital account balances reported by the investment funds subject to their management review and adjustment. The capital account balances reflect the fair value of the investment funds. 
 The fair values of debt and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities). 
 The values for publicly traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for debt securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short term investments approximate their fair values due to their short term maturity. 
 We review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy. 
 Income Taxes 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have federal and state income tax NOL carryforwards of 65.6 million and 107.2 million, respectively. Of the NOL carryforwards, 50.4 million will expire in tax years 2030 through 2042 and 15.2 million will never expire. Of the federal NOL amount, 7.6 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized. 
 A valuation allowance of 21.7 million and 14.6 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three-year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2022 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance 
 43 

with ASC 740, Income Taxes . If the 21.7 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 were reversed in the future, it would increase book value by 1.77 per share. The net deferred tax assets were zero as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 If, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future.

 Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment gains and losses, net of tax, change in fair value of equity securities, net of tax, the gain from VSRM Transaction, net of tax, the loss portfolio transfer risk fee, net of tax, and other gains and losses, net of tax. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:

We use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.

Executive Overview 
 The Company's gross written premiums increased 5.9 million, or 4.5 , to 138.0 million in 2022, compared to 132.1 million in 2021. This was due to a substantial increase in gross written premiums in our personal lines of business, specifically low-value dwelling. This increase was primarily due to additional exposures and increased rates. Our personal lines gross written premium increased 6.1 million, or 40.8 , to 21.1 million in 2022, compared to 15.0 million in 2021. 
 The Company reported a net loss of 10.7 million, or 1.00 per share, in 2022, compared to a net loss of 1.1 million, or 0.11 per share, in 2021. 
 Adjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, was 13.0 million, or 1.22 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an adjusted operating loss of 13.6 million, or 1.40 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 The 2022 results included an 8.8 million non-operating gain in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the step acquisition of VSRM and subsequent sale of its security guard and alarm installation insurance brokerage business to a third party insurance brokerage firm. The Company also recorded a tax benefit of 9.4 million from the utilization of net operating loss tax carryforwards NOLs applied against the taxable gain on the transaction. The deferred tax assets associated with the NOLs had a valuation allowance against it, and thus there was the recognition of the benefit in the period it was used. 
 The Company entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement on November 1, 2022 with Fleming Re in order to reduce its exposure to future unfavorable development on its reserves. The Company was charged a one-time risk fee of 5.4 million, which was reflected as a non-operating loss. Fleming Re will cover an aggregate limit of 66.3 million of paid losses on 40.8 million of stated net reserves as of June 30, 2022, relating to accident years 2019 and prior. Within the aggregate limit, there is a 5.5 million loss corridor in which the Company retains losses in excess of 40.8 million. Fleming Re is then responsible to cover paid losses in excess of 46.3 million up to 66.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded losses through the 5.5 million corridor and 644,000 into the 20.0 million layer. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company incurred 2.0 million of losses and 1.6 million reinsurance reinstatement costs related to Hurricane Ian. 
 The 2021 results included an 8.9 million gain from the June 30, 2021 Venture Transaction, and a 2.8 million gain from the forgiveness of the PPP loan. Both gains are reflected in Other Gains on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also saw continued improvement in our current accident year underwriting results as our mix of business and other underwriting changes helped to produce a 2021 accident year combined ratio of 93.3 . These positive results were offset by 19.4 million of adverse development from prior accident years. 
 The Company experienced 2.0 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoverables, during 2021 from Winter Storm Uri. The Company had 86,000 of reinsurance reinstatement costs relating to Hurricane Irma in 2021.

 Premiums 
 Premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.

Gross written premiums increased by 5.9 million, or 4.5 , to 138.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 132.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to an increase in written premium in our small business and low-value dwelling programs, which was offset by a decrease in written premium in our hospitality programs. Increases in the personal lines business was primarily attributable to an increase in policies, but also due to increases in rates. 
 Commercial lines gross written premiums decreased 207,000, or 0.2 , to 116.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by 4.5 million, or 5.3 , to 89.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was offset by our hospitality programs gross written premiums, which decreased by 4.7 million, or 14.9 , to 27.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Personal lines gross written premiums increased 6.1 million, or 40.8 , to 21.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was largely driven by our low-value dwelling business. 
 Net written premiums decreased 10.2 million, or 10.1 , to 91.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company entered into new specific loss reinsurance treaties on December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2022, which included a 40 ceding commission. This increased ceded written premiums by approximately 11.4 million in 2022. There was no ceding commission on excess of loss treaties during 2021. Ceded earned premiums also increased due to the new treaties by 8.9 million. The increase in ceded earned premiums was offset by the same increase in ceding commissions, which reduced acquisition costs. 
 Other Income 
 Other income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings and policy issuance costs. Other income also includes the interest income from the 6.0 million and 3.0 million promissory notes relating to the Venture Transaction. The 3.0 million promissory note was paid down by Venture on December 14, 2021, and 5.0 million of the 6.0 million promissory note was paid down by Venture on October 20, 2022. Commission income is also received by the Company s insurance agency for writing policies for third-party insurance companies. All of the third-party business was sold to Venture at June 30, 2021. Accordingly, other income from that business diminished in 2022 as that business transitioned to Venture.

Other income increased by 97,000, or 3.6 , to 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other income relating to installment billings and policy issuance costs was lower in 2022 because of the Venture Transaction. This was offset by the interest income received from the 6.0 million promissory note during 2022.

 The Company experienced 24.3 million of adverse development for the year ended December 31, 2022. Of the 24.3 million of adverse development, 23.9 million was related to the Company's commercial lines of business, while 406,000 was related to the Company's personal lines of business. Of the 24.3 million of adverse development, 1.8 million was related to the 2021 accident year, 4.0 million was related to the 2020 accident year, 9.6 million was related to the 2019 accident year, 5.2 million was related to the 2018 accident year, and 3.7 million was related to 2017 and prior accident years. The adverse development was mostly related to the Company's commercial liability lines and was driven by multiple factors including significant social inflation generating higher severity than historical experience, and longer tail exposure than anticipated, particularly in certain jurisdictions. 
 The 19.4 million of adverse development in 2021 consisted of 18.5 million from commercial lines and 957,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2019 and prior accident years. 
 Expense Ratio 
 Our expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.

Our expense ratio decreased by 4.0 to 38.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was largely due to a reduction in policy acquisition costs attributable to 11.4 million of ceding commission from new excess of loss reinsurance treaties. There were no commissions on excess of loss treaties in 2021. 
 Policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased by 6.3 , from 29.3 in 2021, to 23.0 in 2022, mostly due to the new ceding commission mentioned above. 
 Operating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income increased by 2.3 , from 13.1 in 2021, to 15.4 in 2022. The new excess of loss reinsurance treaties with the ceding commission drove net earned premiums lower, resulting in a slightly higher operating expense ratio.

 Net investment income increased by 1.0 million, or 54.6 , to 3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to an increase in interest income in our debt securities due to higher interest rates in 2022. Average invested assets during 2022 were 160.1 million compared to 183.0 million for the same period in 2021. The investment portfolio was comprised of 81.2 debt securities, 3.5 equity securities, and 15.3 short-term investments as of December 31, 2022.

The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.5 years and 3.6 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Realized Investment Gains (Losses) 
 Net realized investment losses were 1.5 million during 2022, compared to 2.9 million of investment gains in 2021. The 4.4 million decrease was due to the Company repositioning its equity portfolio as well as negative overall market conditions that were experienced during 2022. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We issued 25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the Notes in 2018.

Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is 260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing 10.5 million of the Subordinated Notes is 51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the Subordinated Notes. 
 The Company had a 10.0 million line of credit during 2022 and 2021, which it drew upon and paid down at various times. This contributed to the interest expense in 2022 and 2021. The Company had no outstanding balance on its line of credit on December 31, 2022, as the line of credit agreement matured on December 1, 2022. The line of credit agreement was not renewed with the Lender after it matured on December 1, 2022.

Premiums 
 Premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies. 
 Our premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):

Gross written premiums increased by 20.8 million, or 18.6 , to 132.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to an increase in written premium in our small business and low-value dwelling programs, which was slightly offset by a decrease in written premium in our hospitality programs. 
 Commercial lines gross written premiums increased 14.3 million, or 13.9 , to 117.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by 20.3 million, or 31.1 , to 85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was offset by our hospitality programs gross written premiums, which decreased by 5.9 million, or 15.8 , to 31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Personal lines gross written premiums increased 6.4 million, or 75.2 , to 15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 8.6 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was largely driven by our low-value dwelling business. 
 Net written premiums increased 8.5 million, or 9.1 , to 101.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 92.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the increase in gross written premium during 2021. However, this increase was reduced by increased reinsurance rates, and the Company entering into a new specific loss commercial liability treaty on December 31, 2021, that included a 40 ceding commission and resulted in an additional 4.4 million of ceded written premiums at the inception of the agreement. Ceding commissions increased by 1.8 million as well. Ceded earned premiums and total acquisition costs were not impacted in 2021 from this new treaty, after taking into account the change in deferred acquisition costs. However, going forward, we would expect to see higher ceded earned premiums and lower acquisition costs as a result of this treaty.

Other Income 
 Other income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings and policy issuance costs. Other income also includes the interest income from the 6.0 million and 3.0 million promissory notes relating to the Venture Transaction. The 3.0 million promissory note was paid down by Venture on December 14, 2021. Commission income is also received by the Company s insurance agency for writing policies for third-party insurance companies. All of the third-party business was sold to Venture at June 30, 2021. Accordingly, other income from that business will diminish over the next few quarters as it transitions over to Venture, and will ultimately no longer occur. Other income increased by 56,000, or 2.1 , to 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2.6 million in 2020. Other income relating to installment billings and policy issuance costs was lower in the second half of 2021, as the business that was sold to Venture at June 30, 2021, no longer produces other income for the Company. This was more than offset by an increase in the interest income in 2021 of 306,000 from the notes payable.

 The 19.4 million of adverse development in 2021 consisted of 18.5 million from commercial lines and 957,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2019 and prior accident years. 
 The 15.6 million of adverse development in 2020 consisted of 15.2 million from commercial lines and 352,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2018 and 2017 accident years. 
 Expense Ratio 
 Our expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.

Our expense ratio decreased by 3.2 , to 42.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. 
 Policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased by 1.0 , from 30.3 in 2020, to 29.3 in 2021. 
 Operating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 13.1 and 15.3 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lower operating expense ratio was largely due to the Venture Transaction, where 21 employees transitioned from Conifer to Venture on June 30, 2021.

Investment Income 
 Net investment income decreased by 1.2 million, or 37.6 , to 2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income in our debt securities due to lower interest rates. Average invested assets during 2021 were 183.0 million compared to 176.5 million for the same period in 2020. The investment portfolio was comprised of 82.5 debt securities, 7.6 equity securities, and 9.9 short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. The investment portfolio was comprised of 80.2 debt securities, 7.1 equity securities and 12.7 short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. 
 The debt securities portfolio had an average quality was AA and AA+ at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 1.4 and 1.6 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.6 years at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Realized Investment Gains 
 Net realized investment gains decreased by 5.3 million, or 64.6 , to 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to overall market conditions in 2021 that reduced the Company s ability to sell portions of its debt and equity securities for realized gains. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We issued 25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the Notes in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down 19.5 million of the 30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company did not repurchase any of the Notes in 2021. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market in 2020. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is 260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing 10.5 million of the Subordinated Notes is 51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the Subordinated Notes. 
 The Company has a 10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2021, and which contributed to interest expense. The Company had no outstanding balance on its line of credit as of December 31, 2021. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported 5,000 of current federal income tax expense and 203,000 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of 0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 There is a 14.6 million valuation allowance against 100 of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021, which would increase book value by 1.50 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was 13.3 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of 59.7 million, of which 49.8 million expire in tax years 2028 through 2041 and 9.9 million never expire. Of this amount, 12.8 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of 17.0 million, which expire in tax years 2022 through 2041.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 54.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and other income. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt. 
 Management plans to issue new public debt or sell assets that will provide sufficient cash flow to pay off the senior unsecured notes that are coming due within the next twelve months. We believe it is probable that we will be able to issue new public debt or sell assets and repay the senior unsecured notes by September 30, 2023. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities balances will be adequate to meet our operating liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis. With the expected execution of the senior debt refinancing, we believe we can meet our capital needs as well over the next twelve months. 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities balances will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis. 
 We conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the Parent Company. Secondarily, the Parent Company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the Parent Company. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10 of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. No dividends were paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 We contributed 6.8 million, 11.4 million and 1.2 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next twelve months. 
 We are aware that our outstanding debt securities are currently trading at a discount to their face amount. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common stock, or for a combination of cash and common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. The amounts involved in such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities. Cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 40.5 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of 5.4 million for the same period in 2021. The 45.9 million decrease was primarily due to a 45.2 million increase in paid losses and 8.0 million decrease in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums. This decrease was offset by a 6.9 million decrease in the amount of acquisition costs paid during 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 5.4 million, compared to 3.0 million for the same period in 2020. The 2.4 million increase was primarily due to a 12.4 million increase in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums. This increase was offset by a 6.6 million increase in paid claims, a 2.7 million increase in acquisition costs paid, and a 1.4 million decrease in investment income received. 
 Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 56.5 million compared to 1.4 million in 2021. The 55.1 million increase in cash provided by investing activities over the prior year was 
 56 

driven by 34.3 million increase in net proceeds from sale of investments in 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The Company also experienced an increase of 32.8 million from its sale of agency business in 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.4 million. Cash used in investing activities was 7.3 million in 2020. The 8.7 million increase in cash provided by investing activities over the prior year was driven by a reduction in the purchases of investments in 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. There was a significant repositioning of the Company's portfolio during the year ended 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused an increase in the purchase of investments. 
 Financing Activities . Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, was 2.1 million compared to 5.0 million of cash used by financing activities for years ended December 31, 2021. The 7.1 million increase was largely attributed to the Company raising 5.0 million through the issuance of additional common stock in August 2022. 
 Cash used by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, was 5.0 million compared to 5.1 million of cash provided by financing activities for years ended December 31, 2020. The 10.1 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to the Company paying down 8.0 million on its line of credit during 2021. The Company's borrowings under debt arrangements were also 2.7 million less in 2021 compared to 2020. 
 Outstanding Debt 
 On April 24, 2020, the Company received a 2.7 million PPP loan from the line of credit Lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act administered by the SBA. The Company received notice from the SBA that the loan was 100 forgiven, including accrued interest, on July 8, 2021. This resulted in a 2.8 million gain that is included in Other Gains on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 In 2018, the Company issued 25.3 million of Notes. The Notes bear an interest rate of 6.75 annum, payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December and mature on September 30, 2023. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down 19.5 million of the 30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company did not repurchase any of the Notes during 2022 and 2021. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market during 2020 with a face value of 919,000. The Notes were repurchased at a discount to face value, which resulted in a 260,000 gain on extinguishment in 2020. This gain is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Other gains. 
 The Company also has outstanding 10.5 million of Subordinated Notes maturing on September 30, 2038. The Subordinated Notes bear an interest rate of 7.5 per annum until September 30, 2023, and 12.5 thereafter, and allow for four quarterly interest payment deferrals. Interest is payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December. Beginning September 30, 2021, the Company may redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, for a call premium of 1.1 million. The call premium escalates each quarter to ultimately 1.75 million on September 30, 2023, then steps up to 3.05 million on December 31, 2023, and increases quarterly at a 12.5 per annum rate thereafter. 
 The carrying value of the Notes and Subordinated Notes are offset by 1.0 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the loans. Refer to Note 9 ~ Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt. 
 The Company maintained a 10.0 million line of credit with a national bank (the Lender that matured on December 1, 2022. The line of credit was not renewed after it matured. The line of credit contained interest at the London Interbank rate LIBOR plus 2.75 per annum, payable monthly.

Regulatory and Rating Issues 
 The NAIC has a RBC formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s RBC declines. 
 At December 31, 2022, all of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required. 
 Insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 2.3 to 1.0 and 1.5 to 1.0, respectively. 
 The NAIC s IRIS was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates, other relevant market rates or price changes. The volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk. The following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of December 31, 2022. Our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities, which are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our investment portfolio, excluding cash and cash equivalents, was 137.4 million and 182.7 million, respectively. Our investment portfolio consists principally of investment-grade, fixed-income securities, classified as debt securities. Accordingly, the primary market risk exposure to our debt portfolio is interest rate risk. In general, the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed-income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates, while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed-income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates. We attempt to mitigate interest rate risks by investing in securities with varied maturity dates and by managing the duration of our investment portfolio to a defined range of three to four years. The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.5 and 3.6 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The table below summarizes our interest rate risk. The table also illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of our investments, classified as debt securities and short-term investments, to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2022. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather illustrate the effect that events may have on the fair value of the fixed-income portfolio and shareholders equity (dollars in thousands).

Credit Risk 
 An additional exposure to our debt securities portfolio is credit risk. We manage our credit risk by investing primarily in investment-grade securities. In addition, we comply with applicable statutory requirements which limit the portion of our total investment portfolio that we can invest in any one security or issuer. 
 We are subject to credit risks with respect to our reinsurers. Although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage which it assumes, our reinsurance contracts do not discharge our insurance companies from primary liability to each policyholder for the full amount of the applicable policy, and consequently our insurance companies remain obligated to pay claims in accordance with the terms of the policies regardless of whether a reinsurer fulfills or defaults on its obligations under the related reinsurance agreement. To mitigate our credit risk to reinsurance companies, we attempt to select financially strong reinsurers with an A.M. Best rating of A- or better and continue to evaluate their financial condition throughout the duration of our agreements. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net amount due to the Company from reinsurers, including prepaid reinsurance, was 105.7 million and 50.0 million, respectively. We believe all amounts recorded as due from reinsurers are recoverable. 
 59 

Effects of Inflation 
 We do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations, except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claims costs. We consider the effects of inflation in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and LAE. The actual effects of inflation on our results are not known until claims are ultimately settled. In addition to general price inflation, we are exposed to a long-term upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 (a) Dismissal of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 
 On June 1, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee of Conifer Holdings, Inc. (the Company dismissed Deloitte Touche LLP Deloitte as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. 
 During the Company s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and during the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2022 through June 1, 2022, (i) there were no disagreements with Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures that, if not resolved to Deloitte s satisfaction, would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports and (ii) there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
 (b) New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 
 On June 1, 2022, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Plante Moran, PLLC Plante Moran as its new independent registered public accounting firm, subject to Plante Moran completing its client acceptance process. Plante Moran s appointment is for the Company s fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, and related interim periods. 
 During the Company s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and for the subsequent interim period through June 1, 2022, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Plante Moran regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or on the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Plante Moran concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2022. Based on such evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s 
 60 

internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 There was no change in internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 due to the Company s small reporting company status elected on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Conifer Holdings, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Conifer Holdings, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current year audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company s estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (LAE) totaled 165.5 million at December 31, 2022. The Company s reserve for unpaid losses and LAE represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred related to insured events that have occurred as of the reporting date. The Company determines the reserve for unpaid losses and LAE on an individual-case basis for those claims reported as of December 31, 2022, with bulk reserves for additional development, if any, on the reported claims and an estimate for unpaid losses and LAE for all claims incurred related to insured events that have occurred as of December 31, 2022 but have not yet been reported by the policyholders to the Company (collectively referred to as incurred but not reported, or IBNR). The Company estimates IBNR reserves by projecting ultimate losses using industry-accepted actuarial methods. Management engages an independent actuarial firm to prepare an actuarial analysis of unpaid losses and LAE and provides a statement of actuarial opinion on management s estimate of unpaid losses and LAE. 
 64 

Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and LAE requires significant judgment, relating to factors such as claim development patterns, severity, type and jurisdiction of loss, economic conditions, legislative development, and a variety of actuarial assumptions. Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and LAE is inherently uncertain, dependent on management s judgment, and significantly impacted by claim and actuarial factors and conditions that may change over time. The ultimate settlement of unpaid losses and LAE may vary materially from the recorded liability, and such variance may adversely affect the Company s financial results. For these reasons, we identified the estimate of unpaid losses and LAE as a critical audit matter, as it involved especially subjective auditor judgment. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and LAE reserve included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of key controls over the process and data used by management to estimate the liability for unpaid losses and LAE, including those controls related to the estimation of and management s review of the estimated liability of unpaid losses and LAE. 

We tested the completeness, integrity, and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company s and their engaged actuary, such as paid loss data, case reserve data, loss adjustment expense data, and loss development tables. 

With assistance from our engaged actuarial specialist, we reviewed the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions used by the Company and their engaged actuary to develop their unpaid losses and LAE reserve estimate. 

We evaluated management s prior year estimate for unpaid losses and LAE and the factors leading to changes in the estimate recognized in the current year. 

Purchase of Additional Ownership Interest and Subsequent Sale of Certain Agency Business Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 On October 13, 2022, the Company completed a step acquisition by purchasing the remaining 50 percent ownership interest in Venture Agency Holdings, Inc. (VSRM) for 9.7 million, resulting in VSRM being owned 100 percent by the Company. This resulted in a gain on the revaluation of VSRM to fair value at the acquisition date totaling 8.8 million, which is reflected in Revenues and Other income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 On October 14, 2022, VSRM sold certain producer business assets to an independent third party. The assets involved in this transaction relate to VSRM s insurance brokerage and associated services provided largely to the security sector. Collectively, these two events are referred to as the VSRM Transaction. 
 
 We identified the VSRM Transaction as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of VSRM on October 13, 2022, which was used in determining the fair value of the 50 percent ownership interest to 100 percent ownership and the resulting gain on revaluation and the fair value of the assets and liabilities sold. In addition, the events and transaction as a whole are considered complex and infrequent in nature. The audit of the fair value ofVSRM and determination of the gain recognized from revaluation as a result of the step acquisition required auditor subjectivity and judgment and increased audit effort. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the VSRM Transaction included the following, among others: 
 We reviewed all supporting transaction documents for the VSRM Transaction related to the step acquisition that resulted from the purchase of additional ownership interest and obtaining control of VSRM and documents related to the sale of producer business assets to an outside third party. 

We obtained an understanding of the business purpose of the VSRM Transaction. 

We obtained an understanding of internal controls over the process and data used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the VSRM acquisition including the related revaluation gain. 

65 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying internal financial data and supporting documents that were used by the Company to estimate the fair value of VSRM on the acquisition date and the resulting gain from obtaining control prior to the sale of the business producer assets. 

We assessed the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities that were acquired when the Company obtained control of VSRM, which included reviewing the valuation model and key inputs used by management for reasonableness. 

With the assistance of our internal valuation specialists, we evaluated the judgments made by the Company in determining the fair value of the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets and goodwill, and liabilities assumed. 

We reviewed the asset purchase agreement related to the sale of the VSRM business and agreed the assets and liabilities included in the sale to those derecognized by management of the Company at the disposal date. 

We evaluated the overall completeness and accuracy of the VSRM Transaction disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REG ISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Conifer Holdings, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Conifer Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Refer to Note 1 and Note 6 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Management s estimate of the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) relies on several key judgments, including (i) actuarial methods, (ii) relative weights given to these methods by line of business and accident year, and (iii) underlying actuarial assumptions. 
 Actuarial assumptions include (i) expected loss and LAE ratios and (ii) loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop an incurred but not reported liability by line of business and accident year. As of December 31, 
 67 

2021, the unpaid losses and LAE reserve was 139.1 million. Various factors are considered by management in the estimate for the unpaid losses and LAE, including the Company's experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in laws and regulations, judicial decisions and economic conditions. Management uses a combination of actuarial methods to project ultimate losses by line of business and by accident year. 
 We identified the reserves for unpaid losses and LAE as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to develop their valuation. This required a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment and increased audit effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate management s selection of the actuarial methods, weights given to these methods by line of business and accident year, expected loss and LAE ratios, and loss development factors. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of unpaid losses and LAE included the following, among others: 
 
 We considered changes to the Company in the current year, including: 

o Changes to the nature of insurance policies written in the current year, such as changes in retentions, limits and types of insurance risks inherent in the policies. 

o Changes in the Company s mix of business written, by state. 

o Changes in the Company s operations, including those related to changes in claim handling practices, changes in case reserving practices, and pricing changes that could impact the predictability of the trends and patterns observed in the historical data. 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data used by the Company to develop its expected loss and LAE ratios and loss development factors. 

With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the recorded unpaid losses and LAE by: 

o Evaluating the actuarial methods and weights given to these methods by management to develop the estimate of the reserve for unpaid losses and LAE. 

o Developing an independent estimate of the reserve for unpaid losses and LAE, based on actuarial methodologies. 

o Performing a retrospective analysis of management s estimated claims emergence in comparison to actual results. 

Sale of Certain Agency Business Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 During 2021, the Company sold to Venture Agency Holdings, Inc. Venture the customer accounts and other related assets of a portion of its personal and commercial lines of business for the purchase price of 10 million (the Venture Transaction ). The Company recognized an 8.9 million gain in connection with the Venture Transaction. In order to determine the value of the portion of the business sold, the Company obtained a third-party valuation based on a weighting of discounted cash flow and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiple valuation methods. The valuation included significant estimates and assumptions related to (i) forecasted revenue and EBITDA and (ii) the selection of the EBITDA multiple and discount rate. 
 
 We identified the valuation of the Venture Transaction as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the portion of the business sold and the related gain recognized. The audit of the fair value of the Venture Transaction required a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment and increased audit effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to (i) forecasted revenue and EBITDA and (ii) the selection of the EBITDA multiple and discount rate. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 68 

Our audit procedures related to the Venture Transaction included the following, among others: 
 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company to develop the forecasted financial information utilized in the valuation. 

Evaluated the reasonableness of the Company s forecasted financial information by benchmarking the Company s forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA to the industry and peer companies. 

Performed a sensitivity analysis of the key fair value assumptions impacting the discounted cash flow valuation method. 

With the assistance of our fair valuation specialists, we evaluated:

types of insurance businesses: commercial lines, personal lines, and agency business. The Company underwrites a variety of specialty insurance products, including property, general liability, liquor liability, automobile, and homeowners and dwelling policies. The Company markets and sells its insurance products through a network of independent agents, including managing general agents, whereby policies are written in all states in the United States U.S. ). The Company s corporate headquarters are located in Troy, Michigan with additional office facilities in Florida and Michigan. 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 to . Management has determined the appropriate discount rate to use in calculating the right-to-use asset and lease liability is . The Company records a right-of-use asset and lease liabilities included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a right-of-use asset of million, and lease liabilities of million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a right-of-use asset of million, and lease liabilities of million. 
 Other-than-Temporary Impairments The Company reviews its impaired securities for possible other-than-temporary impairment OTTI at each quarter-end. A security has an impairment loss when its fair value is less than its cost or amortized cost at the balance sheet date. The Company considers the following factors in performing its review: (i) the amount by which the security s fair value is less than its cost, (ii) length of time the security has been impaired, (iii) whether management has the intent to sell the security, (iv) if it is more likely than not that management will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, (v) whether the impairment is due to an issuer specific event, credit issues or change in market interest rates, (vi) the security s credit rating and any recent downgrades or (vii) stress testing of expected cash flows under different scenarios. If the Company cannot conclude that declines in fair value below amortized cost are considered temporary, an OTTI loss is recorded through the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the current period. For all other impaired securities, the Company will assess whether the net present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Such a shortfall in cash flows is referred to as a credit loss. For any such security, the Company separates the impairment loss into: (i) the credit loss and (ii) the non-credit loss, which is the amount related to all other factors such as interest rate changes, fluctuations in exchange rates and market conditions. The credit loss charge is recorded to the current period statements of operations and the non-credit loss is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), within shareholders equity, on an after-tax basis. A security s cost basis is permanently reduced by the amount of a credit loss. Income is accreted over the remaining life of a security based on the interest rate necessary to discount the expected future cash flows to the new basis. If the security is non-income producing, any cash proceeds are applied as a reduction of principal when received. 

acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense. Amortization of such policy acquisition costs is charged to expense in proportion to premium earned over the estimated policy term. To the extent that unearned premiums on existing policies are not adequate to cover the sum of expected losses and LAE, unamortized acquisition costs and policy maintenance costs, unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs are charged to expense to the extent required to eliminate the premium deficiency. If the premium deficiency is greater than the unamortized policy acquisition costs, a liability is recorded for any such deficiency. As of December 31, 2022, there was no premium deficiency reserve. The Company considers anticipated investment income in determining whether a premium deficiency exists. Management performs this evaluation at each insurance product line level. 
 
 Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that there is sufficient positive evidence, as allowed under the Accounting Standard Codification ASC 740, Income Taxes, to support the recoverability of those deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance to the extent that there is insufficient evidence to support the recoverability of the deferred tax asset under ASC 740. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If it is determined that the deferred tax assets would be realizable in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company did t have any unrecognized tax benefits and had accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 

million net unrealized loss that was reflected in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2022, total net unrealized losses in the debt securities was million. Management believes it will not need to sell debt securities at significant losses as it has the ability and intention to hold them until their values improve. Management has noted the media has reported a number of recent bank failures. The Company does not have any deposits or investments in any of these banks. Management does not expect any significant impact as a result of these events. 

of Venture Agency Holdings, Inc. Venture and has accounted for its ownership under the equity method of accounting. On October 13, 2022, Sycamore purchased the other of Venture from an individual for million. Following this purchase, Sycamore obtained control and owned of Venture, which was then renamed to VSRM, Inc. VSRM ). VRSM and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, The Roots Insurance Agency, Inc. Roots and Mitzel Insurance Agency, Inc. Mitzel were incorporated into the Company's consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. Sycamore initially purchased the Venture shares with a promissory note for million and ultimately settled the note with million of cash received from the Security Alarm Business sale, described below, and million in the form of stock from the buyer of the Security Alarm Business. The Company acquired the remaining outstanding shares of VSRM, in order to take advantage of net operating tax losses as part of a tax planning strategy to apply to the Security and Alarm Business sale described below, in addition to the strategic focus of getting out of the Security and Alarm line of business. The Company recognized Sycamore's purchase of the individual's shares of VSRM as a step acquisition and revalued all assets and liabilities upon the acquisition date. This resulted in the recognition of an million non-operating gain reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Gain from VSRM Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company also utilized million of federal income tax net operating losses carried forward and million state income tax net operating losses carried forward, for a total net-of-tax benefit of million. VSRM retained million of debt, and million of tax liabilities, as well as other smaller assets and liabilities that did not go with the transaction.

Gain on step acquisition 

The fair value of the equity interest of VSRM immediately prior to the acquisition was million. The fair value techniques used to measure the fair value of VSRM included using the recent valuations performed by third party valuation experts and the net realized proceeds received upon the sale of the Security Alarm Business sold the following day. There were no material transaction costs incurred in the acquisition of VSRM. Additionally, no results of operations for the Security and Alarm business have been included the consolidated financial statements as that business was immediately disposed of. Results of operations for the retained business have been included from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022. On October 14, 2022, VSRM sold all of its security guard and alarm installation insurance brokerage business (the Security Alarm Business to a third party insurance brokerage firm for million, of which million was paid in cash and million was in the form of the buyer's stock. The million of buyer's stock was immediately used to settle a portion of the million promissory note that was issued to buy the of Venture and the remainder of the promissory note was settled with cash from the sale of business. As part of the transaction, the individual who previously owned of VSRM transitioned employment to the buyer, along with a team of approximately eight other employees of VSRM. Also, the Company transferred to the buyer, million of accounts receivable, million of current liabilities, in cash as well as all books and records of the business being purchased. The buyer held back of cash for a future true up of the trade balances which the Company reflected as a current receivable. The Company recognized this transaction as the sale of a business. Because all assets and liabilities were just adjusted to fair value from the step acquisition described above, the basis of the net assets sold equaled the net proceeds from the sale, thus there was no gain recognized upon the sale of the Security Alarm Business.

On December 30, 2022, VSRM contributed its remaining business, including its two wholly owned subsidiaries (Mitzel and Roots) to a new wholly owned subsidiary, Sycamore Specialty Underwriters, LLC SSU ). The business contributed to SSU consisted of customer accounts of substantially all of the personal lines business and a small subset of the commercial lines business underwritten by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries, and all of the customer accounts VSRM produced for third-party insurers, other than the security guard and alarm installation brokerage business previously sold. On December 31, 2022, Sycamore Financial Group, LLC SFG ), wholly owned by Andrew D. Petcoff purchased of SSU from VSRM, Inc. for . As a result, SSU and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Roots and Mitzel, are no longer consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, and VSRM's investment in SSU is accounted for using the equity method. The net assets transferred to SSU had a fair value of at the time of the contribution. There was gain or loss recognized upon the sale of half of SSU to SFG. Included in the net assets transferred to SSU was a million promissory note obligation of VSRM that originated as part of the Venture Transaction described below, and is payable to CIC.

The valuation included significant estimates and assumptions related to (i) forecasted revenue and EBITDA and (ii) the selection of the EBITDA multiple and discount rate. 

million gain on the sale which is reflected in Other Gains on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The fair value measurements that were based on Level 1 inputs comprise of the fair value of the total marketable investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022. Level 2 investments include debt securities and equity securities, which consist of U.S. government agency securities, state and local municipal bonds (including those held as restricted securities), corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The fair value of securities included in the Level 2 category were based on the market values obtained from a third party pricing service that were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other observable market information. The third party pricing service monitors market indicators, as well as industry and economic events. The fair value measurements that were based on Level 2 inputs comprise of the fair value of the total marketable investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022. The Company obtains pricing for each security from independent pricing services, investment managers or consultants to assist in determining fair value for its Level 2 investments. To validate that these quoted prices are reasonable estimates of fair value, the Company performs various quantitative and qualitative procedures, such as (i) evaluation of the underlying methodologies, (ii) analysis of recent sales activity, (iii) analytical review of our fair values against current market prices and (iv) comparison of the pricing services fair value to other pricing services fair value for the same investment. No markets for the investments were determined to be inactive at period-ends. Based on these procedures, the Company did not adjust the prices or quotes provided from independent pricing services, investment managers or consultants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the subordinated debt reported at amortized cost was considered a Level 3 liability in the fair value hierarchy and is entirely comprised of the Company's Subordinated Notes. In determining the fair value of the Subordinated Notes outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the security attributes (issue date, maturity, coupon, calls, etc.) and market rates on September 24, 2018 (the date of the restated and amended agreement which was repriced at that time) were entered into a valuation model. A lognormal trinomial interest rate lattice was created within the model to compute the option adjusted spread OAS which is the amount, in basis points, of interest rate required to be paid under the debt agreement over the risk-free U.S. Treasury rates. The OAS was then entered back into the model along with the December 31, 2022 and 2021 , U.S. Treasury rates, respectively. A new lattice was generated and the fair value was computed from the OAS. There were no changes in assumptions of credit risk from the issuance date.

A treaty is a reinsurance agreement in which coverage is provided for a class of risks and does not require policy by policy underwriting of the reinsurer. Facultative reinsurance is where a reinsurer negotiates an individual reinsurance agreement for every policy it will reinsure on a policy-by-policy basis.

The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors the concentration of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, activities, or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables. The Company's current reinsurance structure includes the following primary categories: Casualty Clash Clash coverage is a type of reinsurance that provides additional coverage in the event that one casualty loss event results in two or more claims and recovery under the reinsurance treaties may otherwise be limited due to the amount, type or number of claims. Clash reinsurance further protects the balance sheet as it reduces the potential maximum loss on either a single risk or a large number of risks.

The net deferred tax liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company has NOL carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million, of which million expire in tax years 2030 through 2042 and million never expire. Of this amount, million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of million, which expire in tax years 2023 through 2042. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of the existing deferred tax assets under the guidance of ASC 740. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three year period ended December 31, 2022. Such objective evidence limits the Company's ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as management's projections for future growth. Based on its evaluation, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the provisions in ASC 740. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present, and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence, such as the Company s projections for growth. The Company files consolidated federal income tax returns. For the years before 2019, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations; however, the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to review years prior to 2019 to the extent the Company utilized tax attributes carried forward from those prior years. The statute of limitations on state filings is generally three to .

classes of insurance businesses: commercial lines, personal lines, and wholesale agency business. Within these three businesses, the Company offers various insurance products and insurance agency services. Such insurance businesses are engaged in underwriting and marketing insurance coverages, and administering claims processing for such policies. The Company views the commercial and personal lines segments as underwriting business (business that takes on insurance underwriting risk). The wholesale agency business provides non-risk bearing revenue through commissions and policy fees. The wholesale agency business increases the product options to the Company s independent retail agents by offering both insurance products from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as products offered by other insurers. The Company defines its operating segments as components of the business where separate financial information is available and used by the co-chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources to its segments and in assessing its performance. In assessing performance of its operating segments, the Company s co-chief operating decision makers, the Co-Chief Executive Officers, review a number of financial measures including gross written premiums, net earned premiums, losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoveries, and other revenue and expenses. The primary measure used for making decisions about resources to be allocated to an operating segment and assessing its performance is segment underwriting gain or loss which is defined as segment revenues, consisting of net earned premiums and other income, less segment expenses, consisting of losses and LAE, policy acquisition costs and operating expenses of the operating segments. Operating expenses primarily include compensation and related benefits for personnel, policy issuance and claims systems, rent and utilities. The Company markets, distributes and sells its insurance products through its own insurance agencies and a network of independent agents. All of the Company s insurance activities are conducted in the United States with a concentration of activity in Michigan, Florida, Texas and California. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 , gross written premiums attributable to these four states were , , and respectively, of the Company s total gross written premiums.

The wholesale agency business sells insurance products on behalf of the Company s commercial and personal lines businesses as well as to third-party insurers. Certain acquisition costs incurred by the commercial and personal lines businesses are reflected as commission revenue for the wholesale agency business and are eliminated in the Eliminations category. In addition to the reportable segments, the Company maintains a Corporate and Other category to reconcile segment results to the consolidated totals. The Corporate and Other category includes: (i) corporate operating expenses such as salaries and related benefits of the Company s executive management team, some finance and information technology personnel, and other corporate headquarters expenses, (ii) interest expense on the Company s debt obligations; (iii) depreciation and amortization on property and equipment, and (iv) all investment income activity. All investment income activity is reported within net investment income, net realized investment gains, and change in fair value of equity securities on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company s assets on the consolidated balance sheet are not allocated to the reportable segments. The following tables present information by reportable segment (dollars in thousands):
