 Certain acronyms and terms used throughout this Annual Report are specific to our company, commonly used in our industry, or are otherwise frequently used throughout our document. Definitions for these acronyms and terms are provided in the "Glossary of Terms," available in the front of this document. 
 Company Overview 
 
 Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. is one of North America's largest and most diversified freight transportation companies, providing multiple full truckload, LTL, intermodal, and other complementary services. Our objective is to operate our business with industry-leading margins and continued organic growth and growth through acquisitions while providing safe, high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers. Knight-Swift uses a nationwide network of business units and terminals in the US and Mexico to serve customers throughout North America. In addition to operating one of the country's largest truckload fleets, Knight-Swift also contracts with third-party equipment providers to provide a broad range of transportation services to our customers while creating quality driving jobs for our driving associates and successful business opportunities for independent contractors. 
 During 2022, we covered 1.4 billion loaded miles for shippers throughout North America, contributing to consolidated total revenue of 7.4 billion and consolidated operating income of 1.1 billion. During 2022, the Truckload segment operated an average of 18,110 tractors (comprised of 16,228 company tractors and 1,882 independent contractor tractors) and 74,779 trailers. Our LTL segment operated an average of 3,176 tractors and 8,431 trailers. Additionally, the Intermodal segment operated an average of 613 tractors and 11,786 intermodal containers. Our four reportable segments are Truckload, LTL, Logistics, and Intermodal. 
 We have historically grown through a combination of organic growth, and through mergers and acquisitions (discussed below). Mergers and acquisitions have enhanced our business and service offerings with additional terminals, driving associates, revenue equipment, and capacity. Our multiple service offerings, capabilities, and transportation modes enable us to transport, or arrange transportation for, general commodities for our diversified customer base throughout the US and Mexico using our equipment, information technology, and qualified driving associates and non-driver employees. We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of full truckload, LTL, logistics, and intermodal services and continuing to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers across multiple service offerings and transportation modes. Our overall objective is to provide full truckload, LTL, logistics, and intermodal services that, when combined, lead the industry in margin and growth, while providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for our customers. 
 Business Combinations and Investments 
 
 We became Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. on September 8, 2017 through the 2017 Merger transaction. Since 1966, we have continuously expanded our nationwide network and our service offerings through organic growth, as well as through the acquisition of twenty-two companies. 
 See Note 1 and Note 4 in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report, for more information regarding the 2017 Merger and our recent acquisitions. See Note 6 in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report, regarding our partnership agreements with Transportation Resource Partners and our other equity investments in transportation-related companies.

 Industry and Competition 
 
 The trucking industry has two primary types of motor carriers: full truckload and LTL. Full truckload carriers represent the largest part of the transportation supply chain for most retail and manufactured goods in North America and typically transport a full trailer (or container) of freight for a single customer from origin to destination without intermediate sorting and handling. By contrast, LTL carriers typically transport multiple shipments from multiple customers in the same trailer (or container). LTL shipments are then sent through a network of service centers where they may be conveyed to other trailers with nearby destinations. Generally, the full truckload industry is compensated based on miles, whereas the LTL industry is compensated based on freight density and length of haul. Overall, the US transportation and logistics industry is large, fragmented, and highly competitive. We compete with thousands of full truckload carriers, most of whom operate significantly smaller fleets than we do, as well as a number of national, regional, and inter-regional LTL carriers. Our trucking segments compete with other motor carriers for the services of driving associates, independent contractors, and management and other employees. To a lesser extent, our intermodal and logistics businesses compete with railroads, LTL carriers, logistics providers, and other transportation companies. Our logistics businesses compete with other logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees. 
 Our industry has recently encountered the following major economic cycles: 
 Period Economic Cycle 2017 2019 strong cycle, driven by a record pricing climate through 2018. The industry experienced increased demand through 2018 for transportation services, including contract and non-contract market demand, partially due to a strong retail season. Capacity became tighter in the second half of 2017 and throughout 2018, due to increasing government regulation, the driver shortage, and severe storms interrupting business, among other factors. Capacity increased in the second half of 2018 leading to an oversupply during 2019, lower spot market rates, and downward pressure on contract rates. 2020 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic led to a new source of volatility throughout the global market in 2020. Economic activities were significantly curtailed across the nation at the onset of 2020, but began to resume in the second half of the year. Accordingly, demand in the freight market was weak in the beginning of the year and gradually strengthened in the second half of the year. The 2020 freight environment was disrupted, with unpredictable shipping volumes, shifts in pricing, and continued challenges in driver sourcing throughout the year. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a source of volatility throughout the global market in 2021 creating supply chain disruptions, increased demand for many products, tight transportation capacity and congestion at ocean ports and rail terminals. 2022 some momentum from 2021 continued into the first quarter of 2022, but much of the year was characterized by uncertainty in the broader economy based on continuing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic abroad, conflicts overseas, waning consumer confidence, and significant inflationary pressures on equipment, fuel, maintenance, labor, and other cost items. Overall consumer demand moderated and shippers worked through inventory overhangs as we experienced ongoing congestion at ports and labor challenges in the rail industry. Capacity, particularly smaller carriers, exited the market rapidly, primarily due to diminished non-contract opportunities and meaningfully higher operating costs, leading to a declining used equipment market. These factors culminated in a muted peak season with fewer spot and project opportunities. 
 The principal means of competition in our industry are customer service and relationships, capacity, and price. In times of strong freight demand, customer service and capacity become increasingly important, and in times of weak freight demand, pricing becomes increasingly important. Most trucking contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee truck availability or shipment volumes. Pricing is influenced by supply and demand. 
 The trucking industry faces the following primary challenges, which we believe we are well-positioned to address, as discussed under "Our Competitive Strengths" and "Our Mission and Company Strategy," below: 
 tightening industry capacity; 
 cumulative impacts of regulatory initiatives, such as ELDs, hours-of-service limitations for drivers, and others; 
 uncertainty in the economic environment, including inflation, rising interest rates, and changing supply chain and consumer spending patterns; 
 driver shortages; 
 increased insurance costs as significant verdicts and settlement amounts for accident claims impact the industry; 
 significant and rapid fluctuations in fuel prices and availability, including in connection with the conflict in Ukraine; and 
 7 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 increased prices for and constrained availability of new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, advancements in technology of revenue equipment, and volatility in the used equipment sales market. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 
 As a provider of multiple transportation solutions, including one of North America's largest truckload fleets, we believe that our principal competitive strengths are our regional presence, customer service (including our ability to provide multiple transportation solutions and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers' needs), operating efficiency, cost control, and technological enhancements in our revenue equipment and supporting back-office functions, and our diverse offerings that allow us to offer multiple transportation services. 
 Regional Truckload and LTL Presence 
 We believe that regional truckload operations, which expanded with the 2017 Merger and our recent acquisitions of ACT, MME, and other companies, offer several advantages, including: 
 obtaining greater freight volumes, 
 achieving higher revenue per mile by focusing on high-density freight lanes to minimize non-revenue miles, 
 enhancing our ability to recruit and train qualified driving associates, 
 enhancing safety and driver development and retention, 
 enhancing our ability to provide a high level of service and consistent capacity to our customers, 
 enhancing accountability for performance and growth, 
 furthering our full truckload capabilities to provide various shipping solutions to our customers, 
 expanding into the LTL space, 
 furthering our logistics capabilities to contract with more third-party capacity providers, and 
 extending our transportation infrastructure, knowledge and scale to strengthen our relationships with third party providers. 
 Operating Efficiency and Cost Control 
 We expect to increase operational efficiencies through the adoption of best practices and capabilities across our brands, as well as the overall size of our company. We operate modern tractors and trailers in order to obtain operating efficiencies and attract and retain driving associates. We believe a generally compatible fleet of tractors and trailers simplifies our maintenance procedures and reduces parts, supplies, and maintenance costs. We regulate vehicle speed, which we believe will maximize fuel efficiency, reduce wear and tear, and enhance safety. We continue to update our fleet with more fuel-efficient post-2014 US EPA emission compliant engines, install aerodynamic devices on our tractors, and equip our trailers with trailer blades, which have led to meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency. We continue to invest capital in new equipment in our Truckload and LTL businesses to take advantage of improvements in tractor cab aerodynamic drag, engine efficiency, and developing fuel saving technologies, including continuing our investment in installing Start-Stop idle reduction technology in substantially all of our tractors to reduce emissions. Our logistics and intermodal businesses focus on effectively optimizing and meeting the transportation and logistics requirements of our customers and providing customers with various sources and modes of transportation capacity across our nationwide service network. We invest in technology that enhances our ability to optimize our freight opportunities while maintaining a low cost per transaction. 
 Customer Service 
 We strive to provide superior, on-time service at a meaningful value to our customers and seek to establish ourselves as a preferred transportation solutions provider for our customers. We provide full truckload and LTL capacity for customers in high-density lanes, where we can provide a high level of service, as well as flexible and customized logistics services on a nationwide basis. Our full truckload and LTL services together include dry van, refrigerated, and drayage, dedicated, expedited, and cross-border truckload lanes, customized according to customer needs. Our logistics and intermodal services include brokerage, intermodal, and certain logistics, freight management, and non-trucking services, which provide various shipping alternatives and transportation modes for customers by leveraging our extensive trailer fleet and utilizing our expansive network of third-party capacity providers and rail partners. We price our full truckload, LTL, logistics, and intermodal services commensurately with the level of service our customers require and market conditions. By providing customers a high level of service, we believe we avoid competing solely based on price. 
 Using Technology that Enhances Our Business 
 We purchase and deploy technology that we believe will allow us to operate more safely, securely, and efficiently. Substantially all of our company-owned tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices that enable us to communicate with our driving associates, obtain load position updates, manage our fleets, and provide our customers with freight visibility, as well as with ELDs that automatically record our driving associates' hours-of-service. The majority of our trailers are equipped with trailer-tracking technology that allows us to better manage our trailers. We have purchased and developed software for our logistics businesses that provides greater visibility of the capacity of our third-party providers and enhances our ability to provide our customers with solutions that offer a superior level of service. We have automated many of our back-office functions, and we continue to invest in technology that we expect will allow us to better serve our customers and improve overall efficiency.

 Diverse Service Offerings with Multiple Transportation Solutions 
 With the addition of LTL services in 2021, we have further expanded our service capabilities while diversifying our revenue streams. We believe our diversified mix and scope of full truckload, LTL, logistics and intermodal services, combined with our value-added service offerings, allows us to provide our customers with one source to meet their shipping and logistics needs, and represents a significant advantage over most of our competitors. We continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers across multiple service offerings and transportation modes to continue to provide efficient and cost-effective solutions for our customers. 
 
 Our Mission and Company Strategy 
 
 Our mission is to operate full truckload, LTL, logistics, intermodal and related businesses that are industry leading in both margin and growth, while providing cost-effective solutions for our customers. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers, as well as our ability to leverage efficiencies and best practices across our brands. We evaluate growth opportunities based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.

 Our operating strategy for our Truckload segment is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. We hope to achieve these goals by primarily operating in high-density, predictable freight lanes and attempting to develop and expand our customer base around each of our terminals by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. We believe this operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in the markets we serve. Our terminals enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet that we believe appeals to driving associates and customers, reduces maintenance expenses and driving associate and equipment downtime, and enhances our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue. 
 LTL Segment 
 Our LTL segment was established in 2021 by the ACT and MME acquisitions. Our operating strategy for our LTL segment is to provide regional direct service and serve our customers' national transportation needs by utilizing key partner carriers for coverage areas outside of our network. Significant investment is needed to establish and maintain a network of LTL service centers. The substantial fixed costs and capital expenditures required for LTL carriers make it challenging for new entrants or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers. We plan to grow the LTL segment through organic growth and acquisitions and believe a national expansion effort will provide enhanced value to our customers. Our business strategy includes the continuous evaluation of yield management from each customer's commodity mix and shipping volume in their corresponding lanes. Additionally, a key component of our strategy is our focused effort with respect to improving utilization of our people, technology, and other resources to maximize operational efficiency while ensuring our customers' freight is delivered safely and timely. 
 Logistics Segment 
 Our operating strategy for our Logistics segment is to match the shipping needs of our customers with the capacity provided by our network of third-party carriers and our rail providers. Our goal is to increase our market presence, both in existing operating regions and in other areas where we believe the freight environment meets our operating strategy, while seeking to achieve industry-leading operating margins and returns on investment. 
 Intermodal Segment 
 Our operating strategy for our Intermodal segment is to complement our regional operating model, allowing us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes, while leveraging our investments in fixed assets. We have intermodal agreements with most major North American rail carriers.

 Growth Strategies 
 We believe we have the terminal network, systems capability, and management capacity to support substantial growth. We have established a geographically diverse network that we believe can support a substantial increase in freight volumes, both organically and through acquisitions. Our network and business lines afford us the ability to provide multiple transportation solutions for our customers, and we maintain the flexibility within our network to adapt to freight market conditions. We believe our unique mix of regional management, together with our consistent efforts to centralize certain business functions to achieve collective economies of scale, allow us to develop future company leaders with relevant operating and industry experience, minimize the potential diseconomies of scale that can come with growth in size, take advantage of regional knowledge concerning capacity and customer shipping needs, and manage our overall business with a high level of performance accountability. 
 Strengthening our customer relationships 
 We market our services to both existing and new customers who value our broad geographic coverage, suite of transportation and logistics services, and industry-leading full truckload and LTL capacity and freight lanes that complement our existing operations. We seek customers who will diversify our freight base. We market our Truckload and LTL dry van, refrigerated, drayage, brokerage, and intermodal services, including dedicated and cross-border services within those offerings, to logistics customers seeking a single-source provider of multiple services but do not currently take advantage of our full array of transportation solutions. 
 Improving asset productivity 
 We focus on improving the revenue generated from our tractors and trailers without compromising safety. We anticipate that we can accomplish this objective through increased miles driven and rate per mile in our Truckload businesses. In our LTL business, our primary focus is increasing density, realizing efficiencies from connecting our ACT and MME networks, and obtaining appropriate yield, measured by revenue per hundredweight. 
 Acquiring and growing opportunistically 
 We regularly evaluate potential opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, and other development and growth opportunities. We became Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. on September 8, 2017 through the 2017 Merger transaction. Since 1966, we have continuously expanded our nationwide network and our service offerings through organic growth, as well as through the acquisition of twenty-two companies. 
 Expanding existing Truckload terminals and LTL door count 
 Historically, a substantial portion of our Truckload revenue growth has been generated by our expansion into new geographic regions through the opening of additional terminals. Although we continue to seek opportunities to further increase our Truckload business in this manner, our primary focus is on developing and expanding our existing terminals by strengthening our customer relationships, recruiting qualified driving associates and non-driver employees, adding new customers, and expanding the range of transportation and logistics solutions offered from these terminals. With our acquisitions of ACT and MME we have created a super-regional LTL footprint and continue to seek opportunities to expand our door count. 
 Diversifying our service offerings 
 We are committed to providing our customers a broad and growing range of full truckload, LTL, logistics, and intermodal services and continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers. We believe that these offerings contribute meaningfully to our results and reflect our strategy to bring complementary services to our customers to assist them with their supply chain needs. We plan to continue to leverage our nationwide footprint and expertise to add value to our customers through our diversified service offerings. 
 Customers and Marketing 
 
 Marketing 
 Our marketing mission is to be a strategic, efficient transportation capacity partner for our customers by providing transportation and logistics solutions customizable to the unique needs of our customers. We deliver these capacity solutions through our network of owned assets, independent contractors, third-party capacity providers, and rail providers. The diverse and premium services we offer provide a comprehensive approach to supply chain solutions for our customers. At December 31, 2022, we had a sales staff of approximately 200 individuals across the US and Mexico, who work closely with management to establish and expand accounts. Our sales and marketing leaders are members of our senior management team, who are assisted by other sales professionals in each segment. Our sales team emphasizes our industry-leading service, environmental leadership, and our ability to accommodate a variety of customer needs, provide consistent capacity, and financial strength and stability. 
 Customers 
 Our customers are typically large corporations in the retail (including discount and online retail), food and beverage, consumer products, paper products, transportation and logistics, housing and building, automotive, and manufacturing industries. Many of our customers have extensive operations, geographically distributed locations, and diverse shipping needs.

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 Consistent with industry practice, our typical customer contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee shipment volumes by our customers or truck availability by us. This affords us and our customers some flexibility to negotiate rates in response to changes in freight demand and industry-wide truck capacity. Our dedicated services within the Truckload and LTL segments assign particular driving associates and revenue equipment to prescribed routes, pursuant to multi-year agreements. This dedicated service provides individual customers with a guaranteed source of capacity, and allows our driving associates to have more predictable schedules and routes. Under our dedicated transportation services, we provide driving associates, equipment, maintenance, and, in some instances, transportation management services that supplement the customer's in-house transportation department. 
 A majority of our terminals are linked to our corporate information technology systems at our headquarters. The capabilities of this system and its software enhance our operating efficiency by providing cost-effective access to detailed information concerning equipment location and availability, shipment tracking, on-time delivery status, and other specific customer requirements. The system also enables us to respond promptly and accurately to customer requests and assists us in geographically matching available equipment with customer loads. Additionally, our customers can track shipments and obtain copies of shipping documents via our website. We also provide electronic data interchange services to customers desiring these services. 
 We believe our fleet capacity, terminal network, customer service and breadth of services offer a competitive advantage to major shippers, particularly in times of rising freight volumes when shippers must quickly access capacity across multiple facilities and regions. 
 We strive to maintain a diversified customer base. Services provided to our largest customer generated 13.1 and 16.1 of total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue generated by our largest customer is reported in each of our reportable operating segments. No other customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue in 2022 or 2021. 
 Our top 25 customers drive a substantial portion of our total revenue, as follows: 
 In 2022, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 48.5 , 36.1 , and 26.8 of our total revenue, respectively. 
 In 2021, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 54.9 , 40.9 , and 29.4 of our total revenue, respectively. 
 Revenue Equipment 
 
 We operate a modern fleet of company tractors to help attract and retain driving associates, promote safe operations, and reduce maintenance and repair costs. 
 In 2022, we obtained the majority of our revenue equipment through cash purchases, and in the future, we will continue to monitor leasing opportunities. We typically obtain tractors and trailers manufactured to our specifications in order to meet a wide variety of customer needs. Growth of our tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and our experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization. In acquiring revenue equipment, we consider a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driving associate comfort, and resale value. We maintain strong relationships with our equipment vendors and have the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate. 
 Our current approach is to replace our tractors between three years and nine years after purchase and to replace our trailers every seven or more years. Changes in the current market for used tractors and trailers, regulatory changes, and difficult market conditions faced by tractor and trailer manufacturers, which have recently resulted in constrained availability of revenue equipment, may result in price increases that may affect the period of time for which we operate our equipment. 
 Our newer equipment has enhanced features, which we believe tends to lower the overall life cycle costs by reducing safety-related expenses, lowering repair and maintenance expenses, improving fuel economy, and improving driving associate satisfaction. In 2023 and beyond, we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of this relatively short tractor trade-in cycle against the lower capital expenditure and financing costs of a longer tractor trade-in cycle, based on current and future business needs.

 Human Capital 
 
 Employees 
 The strength of our company is our people, working together with common goals. There were approximately 28,100 full-time employees in our total headcount of approximately 28,500 employees as of December 31, 2022, which was comprised of: 
 Company driving associates (including driver trainees) 19,500 Technicians and other equipment maintenance personnel 1,600 Corporate and terminal leadership and support personnel 7,400 Total 28,500 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,500 Trans-Mex driving associates in Mexico that were represented by a union. 
 Company Driving Associates 
 We recognize that the recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driving associate workforce, which is one of our most valuable assets, is essential to our continued growth and meeting the service requirements of our customers. In order to attract and retain safe driving associates who are committed to the highest levels of customer service and safety, we focus our operations for driving associates around a collaborative and supportive team environment. To help retain driving associates we provide late model and comfortable equipment, direct communication with management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives designed to encourage driving associate safety, retention, and long-term employment. Some examples of these incentive programs include our Million Miler, military apprenticeship, and Drive for a Degree programs. To help recruit drivers, we have established various driving academies across the US. Our academies are strategically located in areas where external driver-training organizations were lacking. In other areas of the US, we have contracted with driver training schools, which are managed by third parties. There are certain minimum qualifications for candidates to be accepted into the academy, including passing the DOT physical examination and drug/alcohol screening. 
 Terminal Staff 
 Most of our large terminals are staffed with terminal leaders, fleet leaders, driver leaders, planners, safety coordinators, shop leaders, technicians, and customer service representatives. Our terminal leaders work with driver leaders, customer service representatives, and other operations personnel to coordinate the needs of both our customers and our driving associates. Terminal leaders are also responsible for serving existing customers in their areas. Fleet leaders supervise driver leaders, who are responsible for the general operation of our trucks and their driving associates, focusing on driving associate retention, productivity per truck, fuel consumption, fuel efficiency (with respect to driver-controllable idle time), safety, and scheduled maintenance. Customer service representatives are assigned specific customers to ensure specialized, high-quality service, and frequent customer contact. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 Diversity, equity, and inclusion are pillars supporting our innovative culture. We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment, which we believe allows us to leverage the effects of diversity to achieve a competitive business advantage. These efforts are evidenced in our hiring practices and employee training programs. Additionally, our diversity and inclusion networks demonstrate that when diverse voices and perspectives are heard, unique, powerful, and creative solutions are the result. It is with this commitment in mind that we build upon our Employee Resource Groups ("ERG"s) now and in the immediate future. Sponsored and supported by leadership, our ERGs as of December 31, 2022 include the Women in Leadership Network, Somos for LatinX employees and allies, and Inspire, a resource group intended to support Black and African American employees and allies. These, and additional groups launching soon, are integral to ensuring different voices and perspectives contribute to our strategy for long-term profitable growth. 
 Succession Planning and Talent Management 
 We regularly review talent development and succession plans to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. We understand the potential costs and risks of bringing in an outside executive officer in today s environment, and that businesses are often, but not always, more successful in promoting internal 
 12 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 candidates. Accordingly, the Board makes an effort to identify potential successors for those positions long in advance of any potential positional vacancies, perform skills gap analyses for those internal candidates, and provide training and exposure on those gap areas to those candidates in order to develop better potential successors. The Board is primarily responsible for succession planning for the CEO, but also participates in succession planning discussions for other executive officer positions. We believe that our culture, compensation structure, long-term equity program, and robust training and development program provide motivation for talented leaders to remain with the Company. 
 Independent Contractors 
 In addition to our employed driving associates, we enter into contractor agreements with third parties who own and operate tractors (or hire their own driving associates to operate the tractors) that service our customers. We pay these independent contractors for their services, based on a contracted rate per mile. By operating safely and productively, independent contractors can improve their own profitability and ours. Independent contractors are responsible for most costs incurred for owning and operating their tractors. In 2022, independent contractors comprised 8.6 of our total fleet, as measured by average tractor count. 
 Safety and Insurance 
 
 Safety 
 We are committed to safe and secure operations. We conduct an intensive driver qualification process, including defensive driving training. We require prospective drivers to meet higher qualification standards than those required by the DOT, including extensive background checks and hair follicle drug testing. We regularly communicate with drivers to promote safety and instill safe work habits through effective use of various media and safety review sessions. We dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operation and regulatory compliance. We employ technology to assist us in managing risks associated with our business. We have event recorders in substantially all of our tractors, which are used daily by drivers and operations leaders to provide feedback and coaching in regard to driving behaviors. In addition, we have an innovative recognition program for driver safety performance and emphasize safety through our equipment specifications and maintenance programs. Our Corporate Directors of Safety review all accidents and report weekly to leadership. 
 Insurance 
 The primary claims arising in our business consist of auto liability, including personal injury, property damage, physical damage, and cargo loss. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses. We also maintain insurance that covers our directors and officers for losses and expenses arising out of claims, based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. While under dispatch and our operating authority, the independent contractors we contract with are covered by our liability coverage and self-insurance retention limits. However, each is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage, and liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes. Additionally, fleet operators are responsible for any applicable workers' compensation requirements for their employees. 
 We insure certain casualty risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, Mohave and Red Rock. Mohave and Red Rock provide reinsurance associated with a share of our automobile liability risk. In addition to insuring a proportionate share of our corporate casualty risk, Mohave provides reinsurance to third-party insurance companies who provide insurance coverage for affiliated carriers and independent contractors. 
 Please refer to Note 12 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our insurance policies and self-insurance retention limits. 
 Fuel 
 
 We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce our Truckload and LTL fuel costs. Additionally, we utilize a fuel surcharge program to pass a majority of increases in fuel costs to our customers. In 2022, we purchased 21.4 of our fuel in bulk at our locations across the US and Mexico. We purchased substantially all of the remainder through a network of retail truck stops with which we have negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The volumes we purchase at terminals and through the fuel network vary based on procurement costs and other factors. We seek to reduce our fuel costs by routing our driving associates to 
 13 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 truck stops when fuel prices at such stops are more affordable than the bulk rate paid for fuel at our terminals. We primarily store fuel in above-ground storage tanks at most of our other bulk fueling terminals. We believe that we are sufficiently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and dispensing of fuel. 
 Seasonality 
 
 See Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report, regarding the impact of seasonality on our operations. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 
 General 
 We have bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at many of our terminals, as well as vehicle maintenance, repair, and washing operations at some of our facilities, which exposes us to certain environmental risks. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of our facilities in prior years, for which we have been responsible for remediating the environmental contamination. Also, a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials, which are generally rated as low to medium-risk, and subject us to a wide array of regulation. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of clean-up of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events. 
 We have instituted programs to monitor and mitigate environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws governing the hauling, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials, fuel spillage or seepage, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine-idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews. We are a Charter Partner in the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing environmental condition that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. 
 If we are held responsible for the cleanup of any environmental incidents or conditions caused by our operations or business, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to clean-up costs and other liabilities, including substantial fines, penalties and/or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have paid penalties for spills and violations in the past; however, they have not been material to our financial results or position. 
 Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards 
 California ARB In 2008 , the State of California's Air Resources Board ("ARB") approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to utilize technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation, which became effective in 2010, required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to be EPA SmartWay certified or replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low-rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for refrigerated trailers. 
 In February 2018, California's ARB approved California Phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 standards, (discussed in further detail below), with some minor additional requirements, and which would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 standards are affected. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. 
 14 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 In June 2020, ARB passed the Advanced Clean Trucks ("ACT") regulation, requiring original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production and sales of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. The most aggressive ACT standards apply to Class 4-8 trucks, which range from 14,000-33,000 pounds, by requiring that 9 of such trucks be zero emission beginning in 2024 and increasing to 75 by 2035. Similar (albeit lower) increasing zero emission requirements apply to Class 2b-3 trucks, and Class 7-8 trucks between 2024 and 2035. Among other impacts, ACT could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors. It has also led to similar legislation in other states, with Oregon, Washington, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts already adopting ACT, and a number of other states either considering adoption of ACT or affirmatively conducting a preliminary rulemaking process to that effect. ARB is also in the process of considering and finalizing what is known as the Advanced Clean Fleets ACF regulation, also aimed at transitioning to zero emission vehicles beginning in 2024. ACF is a purchase requirement for medium and heavy-duty fleets to adopt an increasing percentage of zero emission trucks, designed to complement the sell-side obligations of ACT. The proposed ACF regulations, generally set to begin in January 2024, apply to three categories of fleet operators: (1) high priority fleets who meet certain thresholds of trucks or revenue (including fleets that operate 50 or more trucks, or generate 50 million or more in gross annual revenue), (2) drayage fleets, and (3) state and local government public fleets. For high priority fleets who meet the applicable thresholds, compliance can be achieved by either (i) ensuring that all new vehicles added to the fleet be zero emission, and removing older vehicles once their statutory useful life is reached, or (ii) meeting certain fleet composition requirements (e.g., percentage of zero emission vehicles in the fleet) by certain dates, with the percentage of zero emission vehicles increasing over time, and resulting in 100 zero emission fleets by 2042 (or earlier for certain classes of vehicles). As with ACT, adoption and implementation of ACF could materially and negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations, operating costs, and related expenses. 
 EPA and NHTSA The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") have begun taking coordinated steps in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency at a national level. In September 2011, the EPA finalized the Phase 1 federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, related to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low-rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions, and reduced accessory loads. 
 In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA announced the final rule regarding Phase 2, which builds upon Phase 1, and would apply to certain trailer types beginning with model-year 2018 for EPA standards (voluntary for NHTSA standards through model-year 2020). Tractors and certain trailer types would be subject to the Phase 2 standards beginning with model-year 2021, increasing in stringency through model-year 2024, and phasing in completely by model-year 2027. This rule marks the first time federal mandates will be applied to trailers, with respect to aerodynamics and low-rolling resistance tires. The final rule was effective in December 2016, but has since been subject to challenges and delays. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment), which proposal has not been resolved. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been challenged in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In November 2021, a panel for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the association challenging the standards and vacated all portions of the Phase 2 Standards that applied to trailers. As a result, the Phase 2 Standards will only require reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for tractors. The Company s new tractor purchases in 2022 complied with the emission and fuel consumption reductions required by the Phase 2 Standards. 
 Even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards have been removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards. 
 In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. In March 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule that included nitrogen oxide emission standards which are more stringent than the Phase 2 Standards for certain heavy-duty motor vehicles. In December 2022, the EPA adopted a final rule that reflected a compromise of the options previously proposed, with new emissions standards of nitrogen oxides for heavy-duty motor vehicles beginning with model year 2027 being more than 80 stronger than current emission standards, with the intent to reduce heavy-duty emissions by almost 50 from today s levels by 2045. The EPA has indicated that the December 2022 rule is the first part of a multi part plan focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, which is commonly referred to as the Cleaner Trucks Initiative, or the Clean Trucks Plan. The EPA has indicated that it plans to release proposals for the remaining steps in the Clean Trucks Plan by the end of March 2023 and is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect. The EPA has 
 15 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 also previously indicated it is working on enacting additional, more stringent, greenhouse gas emission standards (beginning with model year 2030 vehicles) by the end of 2024. 
 Complying with these and any future GHG regulations enacted by California s ARB, the EPA, the NHTSA and/or any other state or federal governing body has increased and will likely continue to increase the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of new trailers, may require us to retrofit certain of our trailers, may increase our maintenance costs, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating costs, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of our equipment, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. We will continue monitoring our compliance with federal and state GHG regulations. 
 Climate-change Proposals 
 Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals related to carbon emissions and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions within certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered tractors (like ours) may idle. 
 These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our driving associates' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driving associate turnover. 
 Industry Regulation 
 
 Our operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies in North America, including the DOT, the FMCSA, and the US Department of Homeland Security, among others. Our company, as well as our driving associates and independent contractors, must comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, including drug and alcohol testing, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state, and local regulations that could have an impact on our operations. 
 Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Bill 
 In July 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century bill into law. Included was a provision that mandates electronic logging devices in commercial motor vehicles to record hours-of-service. Additionally, in response to the bill, a final rule related to entry-level driver training was passed in 2016, as well as amendments to the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. 
 ELD The ELD rule became effective in February 2016 and was phased in over a four-year period, with all drivers and carriers subject to the rule being required to use certified and registered ELDs that comply with the requirements of the ELD regulations by December 16, 2019. 
 Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse In December 2016, the FMCSA amended the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to establish requirements of the Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, a database under its administration containing information about violations of the FMCSA's drug and alcohol testing program for holders of commercial driver's licenses. The final rule became effective in January 2017, with a compliance date in January 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver s licensing agencies to comply with certain requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading or transferring a commercial driver's license. This new action allowed states compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule, however. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market. Pursuant to a new rule finalized by the FMCSA, beginning in November 2024 states will be required to query the Clearinghouse when issuing, renewing, transferring, or upgrading a commercial driver s license and must revoke a driver s commercial driving privileges if such driver is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for one or more drug or alcohol violations.

 In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS") announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral fluid test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in prior court cases. In 2022, an industry group known as the Trucking Alliance, of which the Company is a member, sought an exemption from the FMCSA that would allow positive hair specimen tests to be uploaded into the FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. This request was denied by the FMCSA, however, noting they cannot act until the DHHS finalizes these guidelines. Additionally, in February 2022 the DOT issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would include oral fluid testing as an alternative to urine testing for purposes of the DOT s drug testing program, with a goal of improving the integrity and effectiveness of the drug testing program, along with potential cost savings to regulated parties. Public comment on the proposed rule closed in April 2022, with industry participants generally being in favor. It is unclear if, and when, a final rule may be put in place, however. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers. We currently perform hair follicle testing and will continue to monitor any developments in this area to ensure compliance. Finally, federal drug regulators have announced a proposal to add fentanyl to a drug testing panel that would detect the use of such drug among safety-sensitive federal employees, which would include truck drivers if adopted by the DOT. If the proposal is accepted, DHHS expects to add fentanyl to the testing panel as early as the first quarter of 2023. 
 Entry-Level Driver Training In December 2016, the FMCSA established new minimum training standards (the "ELDT Regulations") which unified curriculum to be followed and completed by certain individuals applying for (or upgrading) a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license, or obtaining a hazardous materials, passenger, or school bus endorsement on their commercial driver's license. Such individuals are subject to the entry-level driver training requirements and must complete a prescribed curriculum of theory and behind-the-wheel instruction prior to taking the skills test. The final rule had an initial compliance date in February 2020. However, in May 2020, the FMCSA approved an interim rule delaying implementation of the ELDT Regulations by two years, which extended the compliance date until February 2022. Now that the rule is effective, training schools and other programs (including ours) are required to implement the prescribed curriculum and register with the FMCSA's Training Provider Registry to certify that their program meets the classroom and driving standards. We will also be required to comply with this rule in the course of operating our driving schools. The effect of these rules could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability or an increase in the time and expense required to operate or expand our driving academies and driver training programs (or both), any of which could adversely affect our business, operations or profitability. 
 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA"); Brokerage Operations 
 Among other things, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA"), signed into law by President Biden in November 2021, created an apprenticeship program for drivers ages 18 to 20 years old to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. The FMCSA announced the establishment of this apprenticeship program in January 2022 in an effort to begin to help the industry s ongoing driver shortage. This program, known as the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program, is open to 18 to 20-year-old drivers who already hold intrastate commercial driver s licenses and sets a strict training regimen for participating drivers and carriers to comply with. Motor carriers interested in participating must complete an application for participation and submit monthly data on an apprentice s driver activity, safety outcomes, and additional supporting information. The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program is limited to 3,000 driver-apprentices at any given time, with new driver-apprentices allowed into the program to replace those that leave or age out. It remains unclear whether any regulatory changes will stem from the apprenticeship program.

 The IIJA also required that the FMCSA clarify the differences between brokers, bona fide agents, and dispatch services, and to further specify its interpretation of the definitions of broker and bona fide agents. As such, and in an attempt to rein in companies engaging in brokerage services without proper FMCSA authority, the FMCSA issued interim guidelines in November 2022, which, among other things, (i) contained a multitude of factors relevant to determining whether a dispatch service actually requires brokerage authority, (ii) clarified that operating as an unauthorized broker carries civil penalties of up to 10,000 per violation, and (iii) clarified that the handling of funds in shipper-motor carrier transactions is an important consideration (pointing towards a broker designation) in the determination of whether someone is a broker or simply an agent. The FMCSA also clarified, however, that any determination will be highly fact specific and will entail determining whether the person or company is engaged in the allocation of traffic between motor carriers. Certain of the Company s subsidiaries currently hold FMCSA brokerage authority, so while the impact of this guidance remains to be seen, the Company does not currently anticipate an adverse impact on its operations. Additionally, in a January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FMCSA proposed more oversight of truck brokers, freight forwarders, and the surety bond and trust companies that back them. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking considers regulatory modifications in five areas: (i) assets readily available, (ii) immediate suspension of broker/freight forwarder operating authority, (iii) surety or trust responsibilities, (iv) enforcement authority, and (v) entities eligible to serve as BMC-85 trustees. Among other changes, the proposal would allow brokers or freight forwarders to meet regulatory requirements to have assets readily available by maintaining trusts that meet certain criteria, including that they can be liquidated within seven calendar days of an event that triggers a payment from the trust. The proposal also stipulates that available financial security falls below 75,000 when there is a drawdown on the broker or freight forwarder s surety bond or trust fund. Adoption of these changes could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations, operating costs, and related expenses. 
 Hours-of-service 
 From time to time, the FMCSA proposes and implements changes to regulations impacting hours-of-service. Such changes can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our driving associates and independent contractors may operate and/or disrupting our network. No such changes are currently proposed. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours. In June 2020 the FMCSA adopted a final rule substantially as proposed, which became effective September 2020. Certain industry groups have challenged these rules in court, and while the FMCSA's final rule has been upheld, it remains unclear if industry or other groups will bring additional challenges against the FMCSA's final rule. Any future changes to hours-of-service regulations could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. 
 Safety and Fitness Ratings 
 There are currently two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers: CSA, which evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards by analyzing data from recent safety events and investigation results, and the DOT safety rating, which is based on an on-site investigation and affects a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Additionally, the FMCSA has proposed rules in the past that would change the methodologies used to determine carrier safety and fitness. 
 DOT Safety Rating The DOT safety rating is currently the only safety measurement system that has a direct impact on a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Knight, Swift, and ACT currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the best available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating.

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 CSA In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced CSA, an enforcement and compliance model that ranks carriers on seven categories of safety-related data. The seven categories of safety-related data, currently include Unsafe Driving, Hours-of-Service Compliance, Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances/Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Hazardous Materials Compliance, and Crash Indicator, (such categories known as "BASICs"). Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (i.e. crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile or score to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. 
 Certain CSA scores were initially published and made available to the general public. However, in December 2015, as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation ("FAST") Act, Congress mandated that the FMCSA remove all CSA scores from public view until a more comprehensive study regarding the effectiveness of CSA improving truck safety could be completed. Although the FMCSA has since provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program, it remains unclear if, when, and to what extent any such changes will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. 
 In May 2020 the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a crash in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program ("CPDP"). The CPDP will expand the types of eligible crashes, modify the Safety Measurement System to exclude crashes with not preventable determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the not preventable determinations in the Pre-Employment Screening Program. 
 Currently, CSA scores generally do not have a direct impact on a carrier's safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may affect driving associate recruiting and retention by causing qualified driving associates to seek employment with other carriers, cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with more favorable scores, subjecting us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. 
 Safety Fitness Determination In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPRM") in the Federal Register, regarding carrier safety fitness determination. The NPRM proposed new methodologies that would have determined when a motor carrier was not fit to operate a commercial motor vehicle. Based on public feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the NPRM related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented. Additionally, the FMCSA is conducting a study on the causation of large-truck crashes, which is expected to gather data through 2024. Although it remains unclear whether such a study will ultimately be completed, the results of such a study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regards to safety and fitness. 
 Equipment Developments 
 In May 2021, the Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act was reintroduced into the US House of Representatives and would require commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiter that would limit the vehicle's speed to no more than 65 miles per hour. Whether this legislation will ultimately become law is uncertain. Furthermore, in April 2022, the FMCSA issued a notice of intent announcing its intention to propose a rule during 2023 which will require certain commercial vehicles to be equipped with speed limiters. While we electronically govern the speed of substantially all of our company tractors, such legislation could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations. 
 For safety, we electronically govern the speed of substantially all of our company tractors. Additionally, our independent contractor agreements include statements that independent contractors must comply with the Company's speed policy. 
 In September 2022, the FMCSA issued an advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would require fleets and independent contractors to equip their trucks with unique electronic identification systems designed to streamline roadside inspections and provide transparency and accountability in day-to-day trucking operations. The petition was generally disfavored by transportation industry participants, citing, among other things, the petition s failure to address privacy and data security risks. It remains to be seen what rules, if any, may stem from this notice.

 In February 2023, the FMCSA issued a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requesting additional information on automated driving systems ADS and seeking comment on regulatory approaches that would enable it to obtain relevant safety information and the current and anticipated size of the population of carriers operating ADS-equipped commercial motor vehicles. Public comment on the supplemental notice will remain open until March 2023, and it remains to be seen, what, if any, final rules will stem therefrom. 
 The FMCSA, in conjunction with the NHTSA, have announced their intention to propose a rule for performance standards and maintenance requirements for automatic emergency braking on heavy trucks. Such proposal is anticipated as early as March 2023, but it remains uncertain what exactly it may require, and whether a final rule will ultimately be put into place. 
 Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 ("FSMA") 
 In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the FSMA. This rule sets forth requirements related to among other things, equipment used to transport food, measures taken during such transportation, personnel training, and record retention. These requirements took effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017 and are also applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker. We believe we have been in compliance with these requirements since that time. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA, or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 As the FDA continues its efforts to modernize food safety, it is likely additional food safety regulations will take effect in the future. In July 2020, the FDA released its "New Era of Smarter Food Safety" blueprint, which creates a ten year roadmap to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. This blueprint builds on the work done under the FSMA, and while it is still unclear what, if any, changes to the current governing framework may ultimately take effect, further regulation in this area could negatively affect our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses going forward. 
 Legislation Regarding Independent Contractors 
 Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have sought in the past to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are also found to have violated employees' overtime or wage requirements. Most recently, the Protecting the Rights to Organize ("PRO") Act was passed by the US House of Representatives and received by the US Senate in March 2021, and remains with the Senate s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The PRO Act proposes to apply the "ABC Test" for classifying workers under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act claims. Additionally, in October 2022, the Department of Labor proposed a new rule regarding independent contractor classification, which if adopted, would evaluate an employer s relationship with workers under six categories to determine whether such worker should be classified as an independent contractor based on a totality of the circumstances and the economic realities of such relationship. It is unknown whether the proposed legislation will become law as currently written or whether any resulting law will include industry-based exemptions. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to: 
 abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, 
 extend the FLSA to independent contractors, and 
 impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. 
 Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and we believe a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Federal and state taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status.

 Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us and other members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Our defense of such class actions and other lawsuits has not always been successful, and we have been subject to adverse judgments with respect to such matters. In addition, carriers such as us that operate or have operated lease-purchase programs have been more susceptible to lawsuits seeking to reclassify independent contractors that have engaged in such programs. If our independent contractors were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. We currently observe and monitor our compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict whether future laws and regulations, judicial decisions, or settlements regarding the classification of independent contractors will adversely affect our business or operations. 
 In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 ("AB5"), a new law that changed the landscape of the state s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged "ABC Test" must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all three of the following criteria: 
 the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; 
 the worker is performing work outside the usual course of the business of the hiring company; 
 the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business. 
 How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 30, 2018. While it was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association ("CTA") went forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the reasoning behind the injunction in April 2021, ruling that AB5 is not pre-empted by federal law, but granted a stay of the AB5 mandate in June 2021, preventing its application and temporarily continuing the injunction, while the CTA petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the decision. In November 2021, the US Supreme Court requested that the US solicitor general weigh in on the case. The injunction remained in place until the US Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. As a result, the injunction was lifted and retroactively placed AB5 into law as of January 2020. While the stay of the AB5 mandate provided temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, the CTA and other industry groups are continuing to bring challenges against AB5 and it remains unclear whether the CTA or other industry groups will ultimately be successful in receiving future injunctions or in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. 
 State Wage and Hour Legislation 
 In December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the American Trucking Associations and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision. In January 2021, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FMCSA s determination that federal law does preempt California's meal and rest break laws, as applied to drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Company and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the US. If federal legislation is not passed preempting state and local wage and hour laws, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance costs, increased driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.

 Other Regulation 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 President Biden has indicated his intent to make a green infrastructure package a top priority for his administration. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by President Biden. Among other considerations, the Inflation Reduction Act contains provisions relating to energy, climate change, and tax reform. In particular, the Inflation Reduction Act shifts timing for certain tax payments, imposes an excise tax on certain corporate stock buybacks, and creates a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax, which is generally applicable to corporations that reported over 1 billion in profits in each of the three proceeding tax years. Tax changes in the Inflation Reduction Act, together with changes to any other U.S. tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability. It is unclear what other legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo. However, adoption and implementation could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses. 
 Truck Parking 
 In November 2022, Senate lawmakers introduced legislation that would set aside grant funds over four years to expand truck parking across the United States. Such legislation would allow for the creation of new parking areas, the expansion of existing facilities, and the approval of commercial parking at existing weigh stations, rest areas, and park-and-ride facilities. It would also allow for truck parking expansion at commercial truck stops and travel plazas. Industry groups are generally in favor of the bill, as a lack of available parking has negatively impacted the industry as a whole, including the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 Brokerage Liability 
 In June 2022, the US Supreme Court declined to review a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision involving a personal injury suit alleging that a freight broker had liability for an accident because it breached its duty to select a competent contractor to transport the load in question. In its petition to the US Supreme Court, the broker unsuccessfully argued that the Ninth Circuit s decision improperly disallowed federal pre-emption, and would expose freight brokers to a patchwork of state regulations across the United States. This development potentially calls into question freight brokers ability to rely on federal agency standards in selecting motor carriers, given the carrier involved in the accident was allegedly in good standing with the FMCSA when it was chosen to transport the load. It could also lead to primary (as opposed to contingent) liability being imposed upon freight brokers, and increased insurance premiums for brokerage operations generally. Although we are committed to selecting safe and secure motor carriers in carrying out our brokerage activities, if we are found to be negligent in the motor carrier selection process it could lead to significant liabilities in the event of an accident, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. 
 IIJA 
 The IIJA was signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. The roughly 1.2 trillion bill contains an estimated 550 billion in new spending, which will impact transportation. In particular, it dedicates more than 100 billion for surface transportation networks and roughly 66 billion for freight and passenger rail operations. Provisions in the law specific to trucking are discussed above. It otherwise remains unclear how the IIJA will be implemented into and affect our industry in the long term. The IIJA may result in increased compliance and implementation related expenses, which could have a negative impact on our operations. 
 SHIP IT Act 
 In January 2023, the Safer Highways and Increased Performance for Interstate Trucking Act (the SHIP IT Act was introduced into the US House of Representatives. As proposed, the SHIP IT Act would allow states to issue special permits for overweight vehicles and loads during emergencies, allow drivers to apply for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grants, attempt to recruit truck drivers to the industry through targeted and temporary tax credits, streamline the CDL process in certain respects, and expand access to truck parking and rest areas for commercial drivers. It remains unclear whether the SHIP IT Act will ultimately become law, however, and what changes it may undergo prior finalization.

 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
 The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ("USMCA") was entered into effect in July 2020. The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of freight we transport. 
 Regulatory Impacts from COVID-19 
 Given COVID-19 s considerable effect on our nation and the transportation industry, the FMCSA previously issued and extended various temporary measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as additional tools, protective equipment, policies, practices, and medicines have been developed in response to COVID-19, in October 2022, the FMCSA ended the hours of service waiver previously issued with respect to certain types of shipments, such as, livestock, medical supplies, vaccines, groceries, and diesel fuel. Although to date these response measures have largely been enacted in order to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances, any further responsive measures or the lapsing of temporary measures previously enacted, remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations. 
 In November 2021 the US Department of Labor s Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") published an emergency temporary standard (the "Emergency Rule") requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require any employees who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work. The Emergency Rule has been blocked by the US Supreme Court and was subsequently withdrawn by OSHA in January 2022. Effective January 2022, the US prohibited unvaccinated foreign citizens from entering the country. The US Transportation Security Administration subsequently extended the travel prohibition for unvaccinated foreign citizens until April 10, 2023. Furthermore, effective January 2022, and until October 1, 2022, Canada prohibited unvaccinated foreign citizens, including US citizens, from crossing their border. These border requirements, as well as any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are allowed to go into effect, could, among other things, (i) cause our unvaccinated employees (particularly our unvaccinated driving associates) to go to smaller employers, if such employers are not subject to future mandates, or leave the trucking industry, (ii) result in logistical issues, increased expenses, and operational issues from arranging for weekly tests of our unvaccinated employees, especially our unvaccinated driving associates, (iii) result in increased costs for recruitment and retention of driving associates, including the cost of weekly testing, and (iv) result in decreased revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain driving associates. Any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that apply to driving associates could significantly reduce the pool of driving associates available to us and our industry, which would further impact the ongoing extreme shortage of available driving associates. Accordingly, any vaccination, testing or mask mandates, if allowed to go into effect, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 When evaluating our company, the following risks should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report. If we are unable to mitigate and/or are exposed to any of the following risks in the future, then there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Our risks are grouped into the following risk categories: Strategic Operational Compliance Financial Industry and Competition Company Growth Trucking Industry Regulation Capital Requirements Market Changes Employees Environmental Regulation Debt Macroeconomic Changes Independent Contractors Insurance Regulation Investments Mergers and Acquisitions Vendors and Suppliers ESG Goodwill and Intangibles International Operations Customers Information Systems Public Health 
 Strategic Risk 
 
 Our business is subject to economic, credit, business, and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 The full truckload, LTL, intermodal, and brokerage industries are highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Economic conditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of available tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the US economy is weakened. During such times, we may experience a reduction in overall freight levels and freight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and our customers freight demands. 
 We cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations, cost increases, revenue equipment resale values, or how consumer confidence, macroeconomic conditions, or production capabilities, could be affected by armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, government efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs. 
 We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could limit growth opportunities and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. The following factors could limit our growth opportunities and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations: 
 many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain or grow profitability of our business; 
 some of our customers operate their own private trucking fleets and they may decide to transport more of their own freight; 
 competition from non-asset-based and other logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates; 
 advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments; and 
 our brand names are valuable assets that are subject to the risk of adverse publicity (whether or not justified), which could result in the loss of value attributable to our brand and reduced demand for our services.

 Increased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, decreased availability of new revenue equipment, future use of autonomous trucks, and the failure of manufacturers to meet their sale or trade-back obligations to us could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and profitability. 
 We are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new equipment for our full truckload and LTL operations. We have experienced an increase in prices for new tractors and trailers over the past few years, a significant increase in costs in recent quarters, and the resale value of the tractors and trailers has not increased to the same extent. Increased regulation has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, in some cases, resulting in lower fuel mileage, and increasing our operating expenses. Future use of autonomous tractors could increase the price of new tractors and decrease the value of used, non-autonomous tractors . We expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses for the foreseeable future. 
 Furthermore, a decrease in vendor output may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to purchase a quantity of new revenue equipment that is sufficient to sustain our desired growth rate and to maintain a late-model fleet. 
 Tractor and trailer vendors may reduce their manufacturing output in response to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or shortages of component parts. Tractor and trailer manufacturers are still experiencing periodic shortages of certain components and supplies, including semiconductor chips, forcing some manufacturers to curtail or suspend their production, which has led to a lower supply of tractors and trailers, higher prices, and lengthened trade cycles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly our maintenance expense and driver retention. 
 We have certain revenue equipment leases and financing arrangements with balloon payments at the end of the lease term equal to the residual value we are contracted to receive from certain equipment manufacturers upon sale or trade back to the manufacturers. If we do not purchase new equipment that triggers the trade-back obligation, or the equipment manufacturers do not pay the contracted value at the end of the lease term, we could be exposed to losses equal to the excess of the balloon payment owed to the lease or finance company over the proceeds from selling the equipment on the open market. 
 We have trade-in and repurchase commitments that specify, among other things, what our primary equipment vendors will pay us for disposal of a substantial portion of our revenue equipment. The prices we expect to receive under these arrangements may be higher than the prices we would receive in the open market. We may suffer a financial loss upon disposition of our equipment if these vendors refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements. 
 Declines in demand for our used revenue equipment could result in decreased equipment sales, resale values, and gains on sales of assets. 
 We are sensitive to the used equipment market and fluctuations in prices and demand for tractors and trailers. The market for used equipment is affected by several factors, including the demand for freight, the supply of new and used equipment, the availability and terms of financing, the presence of buyers for export to foreign countries, and commodity prices for scrap metal. Declines in demand for the used equipment we sell could result in diminished sales volumes or lower used equipment sales prices, either of which could negatively affect our gains on sales of assets. We have seen a softening of the used equipment market recently. 
 If fuel prices increase significantly or fuel availability becomes scarce, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Our full truckload and LTL operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, and accordingly, significant increases in diesel fuel costs or decreases in availability of fuel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges. 
 The price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather, global politics, and other market factors. Fuel is subject to regional pricing differences and often costs more on the West Coast and in the Northeast, where we have significant operations. While we use a fuel surcharge program to recapture a portion of the increases in fuel prices it does not protect us against the full effect of increases in fuel prices. Because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. Our results of operations would be negatively affected and more volatile to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program. In 2022, certain isolated

 regions of the US experienced short-term shortages of diesel fuel. Any widespread or long-term shortage or rationing of diesel fuel, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, expansion of such conflict to other areas or countries or similar conflicts could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 Although we do not have any direct operations in Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine, we may be affected by the broader consequences of the Russia and Ukraine conflict or expansion of such conflict to other areas or countries or similar conflicts elsewhere, such as, increased inflation, supply chain issues, including access to parts for our revenue equipment, embargoes, geopolitical shift, access to diesel fuel, higher energy prices, potential retaliatory action by the Russian or other governments, including cyber-attacks, and the extent of the conflict s effect on the global economy. The magnitude of these risks cannot be predicted, including the extent to which the conflict may heighten other risks disclosed herein. Ultimately, these or other factors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are subject to certain risks arising from doing business in Mexico. 
 We have growing operations in Mexico, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Trans-Mex, which subjects us to general international business risks, including: 
 foreign currency fluctuation; 
 changes in Mexico's economic strength; 
 difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; 
 burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and US export, import, business procurement, transparency, and corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 
 changes in trade agreements and US-Mexico relations; 
 theft or vandalism of our revenue equipment; and 
 social, political, and economic instability. 
 We may not make acquisitions in the future, or if we do, we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy. 
 Historically, acquisitions have been a part of our growth strategy. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. If we do not make any future acquisitions, our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected. Any future acquisitions we undertake could involve issuing dilutive equity securities or incurring indebtedness, the terms of which may be less favorable to us than anticipated. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: 
 the acquired company may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow; 
 we may assume liabilities beyond our estimates or what was disclosed to us; 
 we may be unable to successfully assimilate or integrate the acquired company's operations or assets into our business and realize the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems; 
 transaction costs and acquisition-related integration costs could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such costs are recorded; 
 diverting our management's attention from other business concerns; 
 risks of entering into new markets or business offerings in which we have had no or only limited prior experience; and 
 the potential loss of customers, key employees, or driving associates of the acquired company.

 Operational Risk 
 
 We may not grow substantially in the future and we may not be successful in sustaining or improving our profitability. 
 There is no assurance that in the future, our business will grow substantially or without volatility, nor can we assure you that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. Furthermore, there is no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions or that we will be able to sustain or improve our profitability in the future. 
 Furthermore, the continued progression and development of new business offerings are subject to risks, including, but not limited to: 
 initial unfamiliarity with pricing, service, operational, and liability issues; 
 the potential need for additional capital, including for terminals and equipment; 
 customer relationships may be difficult to obtain or retain, or we may have to reduce rates to gain and develop customer relationships; 
 specialized equipment and information and management systems technology may not be adequately utilized; 
 insurance and claims may exceed our past experience or estimations; and 
 we may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel and management with requisite experience or knowledge of our logistics services, LTL operations, and other developing service offerings. 
 We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
 A significant portion of our operating revenue is generated from a number of major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Refer to Part I, Item 1, "Business" for information regarding our customer concentrations. Aside from our dedicated operations, we generally do not have long-term contractual relationships, rate agreements, or minimum volume guarantees with our customers. There is no assurance any of our customers will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, continue at the same volume levels, or not seek to modify terms of existing contracts. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Retail and discount retail customers account for a substantial portion of our freight. Accordingly, our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and retail sales than carriers that do not have this concentration. 
 In addition, our customers' financial difficulties could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, especially if these customers were to delay or default on payments to us. For our multi-year and dedicated contracts, the rates we charge may not remain advantageous. Further, despite the existence of contractual arrangements, certain of our customers may nonetheless engage in competitive bidding processes that could negatively impact our contractual relationship. 
 We depend on third-party capacity providers, and service instability from these transportation providers could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer intermodal and brokerage services, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and customer relationships. 
 Our intermodal operations use railroads and some third-party drayage carriers to transport freight for our customers, and intermodal dependence on railroads could increase as intermodal services expand. In certain markets, rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad. Intermodal providers have experienced poor service from providers of rail-based services in the past. Our ability to provide intermodal services in certain traffic lanes would be reduced or eliminated if the railroads' services became unstable. Railroads could reduce their services in the future for various reasons, which may include work stoppages insufficient network capacity, adverse weather conditions, accidents, or other factors, which could increase the cost of the rail-based services we provide, create cargo claims and could reduce the reliability, timeliness, efficiency, and overall attractiveness of our rail-based intermodal services. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, our intermodal operations have been negatively impacted by threats of labor strikes across the rail industry. Although labor challenges in the rail industry appear to have softened, any heightened threat of a work stoppage or actual strike among rail employees could significantly reduce or even halt operating capacity of our intermodal operations, which could have a materially adverse effect on 
 27 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, price increases could result in higher costs to us, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers and could result in the reduction or elimination of our ability to offer intermodal services. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate additional contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, obtain multiple providers, or obtain railroad services at current cost levels, any of which could limit our ability to provide this service. 
 Our logistics operations are dependent upon the services of third-party capacity providers, including other truckload capacity providers. These third-party providers may seek other freight opportunities and may require increased compensation in times of improved freight demand or tight full truckload and LTL capacity. Most of our third-party capacity provider transportation services contracts are cancelable on 30 days' notice or less. If we are unable to secure the services of these third-parties, or if we become subject to increases in the prices we must pay to secure such services, and we are not able to obtain corresponding customer rate increases, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. 
 Our future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We self-insure, or insure through our captive insurance companies, a significant portion of our claims exposure. For a detailed discussion of our self-insurance programs, including self-insurance retention limits, please refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Higher self-insured retention levels may increase the impact of auto liability occurrences on our results of operations. We reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, and claims may ultimately prove to be more severe than our estimates. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. Accordingly, ultimate results may differ materially from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that the amount of one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage, we would bear the excess, in addition to our other self-insured amounts. Furthermore, insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including transportation companies. 
 In addition, rising healthcare costs could negatively impact financial results or force us to make changes to existing benefit programs, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees. 
 Insuring risk through our captive insurance companies could adversely impact our operations. 
 We insure certain affiliated risks through our captive insurance company, Mohave and through our risk retention group, Red Rock. Additionally, Mohave provides reinsurance to third-party insurance companies for affiliated risks insured by those third-party insurance companies. Red Rock insures a share of our automobile liability risk. The insurance and reinsurance markets are subject to market pressures. Our captive insurance companies' abilities or needs to access the reinsurance markets may involve the retention of additional risk, which could expose us to volatility in claims expenses. 
 Our captive insurance companies are regulated by state authorities. State regulations generally provide protection to policy holders, rather than stockholders. These regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance, limit our ability to change premiums, restrict our ability to access cash held in our captive insurance companies, and otherwise impede our ability to take actions we deem advisable. 
 In the future, we may continue to insure our automobile liability risk through our captive insurance subsidiaries, which will cause increases in the required amount of our restricted cash or other collateral, such as letters of credit. Significant increases in the amount of collateral required by third-party insurance carriers and regulators would reduce our liquidity. 
 If we are unable to recruit, develop, and retain our key employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 We are highly dependent upon the services of certain key employees and we believe their valuable knowledge about the trucking industry and relationships with our key customers and vendors would be difficult to replicate. We currently do not have employment agreements with our key employees, and the loss of any of their services or inadequate succession planning could negatively impact our operations and future profitability.

 Increases in driving associate compensation or difficulties attracting and retaining qualified driving associates could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and the ability to maintain or grow our fleet. 
 Difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified driving associates, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers, could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability. The full truckload and LTL transportation industries are subject to a shortage of qualified driving associates. Such shortage is exacerbated during periods of economic expansion, in which there may be alternative employment opportunities, or during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing is limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment or for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Furthermore, capacity at driving schools may be limited by future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks and any governmental imposed lockdown or other attempts to reduce the spread of such an outbreak may reduce the pool of potential drivers available to us. Regulatory requirements could further reduce the number of eligible driving associates. We believe our employee screening process, which includes extensive background checks and hair follicle drug testing, is more rigorous than generally employed in our industry and has decreased the pool of qualified applicants available to us. Our inability to engage a sufficient number of driving associates and independent contractors may negatively affect our operations. Further, our driving associate compensation and independent contractor expenses are subject to market conditions and we may find it necessary to increase driving associate and independent contractor contracted rates in future periods. 
 In addition, we suffer from a high turnover rate of driving associates and independent contractors. This high turnover rate requires us to spend significant resources on recruiting and retention. 
 Our arrangements with independent contractors expose us to risks that we do not face with our company driving associates. 
 Our financing subsidiaries offer financing to some of the independent contractors we contract with to purchase or lease tractors from us. If these independent contractors default or experience a lease termination in conjunction with these agreements and we cannot replace them, we may incur losses on amounts owed to us. Also, if liquidity constraints or other restrictions prevent us from providing financing to the independent contractors we contract with in the future, then we could experience a shortage of independent contractors. 
 Our lease contracts with independent contractors are governed by federal leasing regulations, which impose specific requirements on us and the independent contractors. In the past, we have been the subject of lawsuits, alleging violations of lease agreements or failure to follow the contractual terms, some of which resulted in adverse decisions against the Company. We could be subjected to similar lawsuits and decisions in the future, which if determined adversely to us, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 We are dependent on management information and communications systems and other information technology assets (including the data contained therein), and a significant systems disruption or failure in the foregoing, including those caused by cybersecurity breaches, could adversely affect our business. 
 Our business depends on the efficient, stable, and uninterrupted operation of our management information and communications systems and other information technology assets (including the data contained therein). Our management information and communication systems are used in various aspects of our business. If any of our critical information or communications systems fail or become unavailable, it could temporarily affect the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. Our operations and those of our providers are vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, such as fires, storms, and floods, which may increase in frequency and severity due to climate change. We are also vulnerable to interruption by power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, internet failures, and other events beyond our control. Our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of a system failure, disruption, or security breach that causes a delay, interruption, or impairment of our services and operations. Although we carry insurance to help protect us from losses due to an interruption of our systems, the risk of a system failure, especially due to a cyber-attack, has increased since the commencement of the war between Russia and Ukraine. However, we are unable to quantify the degree which the risk has increased due to the conflict. In addition, there is no guarantee such an attack will fall within the coverage limits of our insurance.

 We receive and transmit confidential data in the normal course of business. Despite our implementation of safeguards, our information and communication systems are vulnerable to disruption, unauthorized access and viewing, misappropriation, altering, or deleting of information. A security breach could damage our business operations and reputation and could cause us to incur costs associated with repairing our systems, increased security, customer notifications, lost operating revenue, litigation, regulatory action, and reputational damage. 
 Some of our employees work remotely, which may increase the cybersecurity risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing, and other cybersecurity attacks. 
 We have, and will continue to have, a portion of our employee population that works from home full-time or under flexible work arrangements, and we have provided associates with expanded remote network access options which enable them to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks. Our employees working remotely may expose us to cybersecurity risks through: (i) unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access, including our employees use of Company-owned and personal devices and videoconferencing functions and applications to remotely handle, access, discuss, or transmit confidential information, (ii) increased exposure to phishing and other scams as cybercriminals may, among other things, install malicious software on our systems and equipment and access sensitive information, and (iii) violation of international, federal, or state-specific privacy laws. We believe that the increased number of employees working remotely has incrementally increased our cyber risk profile, but we are unable to predict the extent or impacts of those risks at this time. A significant disruption of our information technology systems, unauthorized access to or loss of confidential information, or legal claims resulting from our violation of privacy laws could each have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Seasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability or make our results of operations and profitability more volatile. 
 "Seasonality" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, discusses in detail how seasonality and weather could impact our operations. 
 Our business and results of operations have been and will be, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks, and such impact could be materially adverse, during the pandemic or after the pandemic subsides. 
 The global spread of COVID-19, including its variants, has created, and any other outbreaks of similar contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments could create, significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Our operations, particularly in areas of increased COVID-19 infections or similar outbreaks, could be disrupted. Furthermore, government vaccine, testing, and mask mandates, or other responses to COVID-19 or similar outbreaks, could increase our turnover and make recruiting more difficult, particularly among our driver personnel. Negative financial results, operational disruptions, driver and non-driver absences, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks, or a recession that results from such an outbreak, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, reduce credit options available to us, and adversely impact our ability to effectively meet our short- and long-term obligations. 
 The COVID-19 outbreak has caused, and other similar outbreaks could cause, uncertainty in the economy. Risks related to an economic slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled "Our business is subject to economic, credit, business, and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations." 
 Developments related to COVID-19 have been unpredictable and the extent to which further developments related to COVID-19 or similar outbreaks could impact our operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain. Such developments may include the duration of the outbreak, the distribution and availability of vaccines and treatments for the disease, the severity of the disease, and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to an outbreak.

 Compliance Risk 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in existing regulations or violat i ons of existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability. 
 We, our drivers, and our equipment are regulated by the DOT, the EPA, the DHS, and other state and federal agencies in the states, provinces, and countries in which we operate. Future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may be more stringent, require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 "Industry Regulation" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, discusses in detail industry regulations that could materially impact our business, financial condition, and operations. 
 Receipt of an unfavorable DOT safety rating or an unfavorable ranking under the CSA program could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and operations. 
 If we received a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating or an unfavorable ranking under the CSA program, it could lead to increased risk of liability, increased insurance, maintenance and equipment costs, and potential loss of customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 "Industry Regulation" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides discussion of the DOT safety rating system and the CSA program. 
 Compliance with various environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject may increase our costs of operations, and non-compliance with such laws and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties. 
 We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, in the event of any of the following, we could be subject to clean-up costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations: 
 we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances; 
 there are releases of hazardous substances we transport; 
 soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations; and 
 we are found to be in violation of or fail to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, then we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 Certain of our terminals are located on or near environmental Superfund sites designated by the EPA and/or state environmental authorities. We have not been identified as a potentially responsible party with regard to any such site. Nevertheless, we could be deemed responsible for clean-up costs. 
 In addition, tractors and trailers used in our full truckload and LTL operations are affected by laws and regulations related to air emissions and fuel efficiency. Governmental agencies continue to enact more stringent laws and regulations to reduce engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines used in our revenue equipment. We have incurred and continue to incur costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. Additionally, in certain locations governments have banned or may in the future ban internal combustion engines for some types of vehicles. To the extent these bans affect our revenue equipment, we may be forced to incur substantial expense to retrofit existing engines or make capital expenditures to update our fleet. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
 "Environmental Regulation" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business and operations.

 Developments in labor and employment law and any unionizing efforts by employees could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Although our only collective bargaining agreement exists at our Mexican subsidiary, Trans-Mex, we always face the risk that our employees will try to unionize. If we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our domestic employees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, customer retention, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, and could cause significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations, because: 
 restrictive work rules could hamper our ability to improve or sustain operating efficiency or could impair our service reputation and limit our ability to provide certain services; 
 a strike or work stoppage could negatively impact our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships; 
 shippers may limit their use of unionized companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages; 
 unionization of any of our operations could lead to pressure on our LTL and full truckload employees to unionize; 
 collective agreements could result in material increases in wages and benefits; and 
 an election and bargaining process could divert management s time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses. 
 If the independent contractors we contract with were ever re-classified as employees, the magnitude of this risk would increase. "Industry Regulation" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides discussion of labor and employment laws applicable to our business and operations. 
 If our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or the judicial process to be employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Carriers such as us that operate or have operated lease-purchase programs have been more susceptible to lawsuits seeking to reclassify independent contractors that have engaged in such programs. If the independent contractors we engage were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, insurance, discrimination, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Furthermore, if independent contractors were deemed employees, then certain of our third-party revenue sources, including shop and insurance margins, would be eliminated. "Industry Regulation" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides discussion of legislation regarding independent contractors. 
 Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our business is subject to the risk of litigation. Recently, trucking companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal breaks, rest periods, overtime eligibility, and failure to pay for all hours worked. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by the defendants. 
 The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may also be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance, and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, involve significant aggregate use of our self-insured retention amounts, or cause increases in future premiums, the resulting expenses could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 In addition, we may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from trucking accidents. The number and severity of litigation claims may be worsened by distracted driving by both truck drivers and other motorists. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and increases of our insurance costs.

 Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing US and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs and adversely affect our business. 
 The imposition of additional tariffs or quotas or changes to certain trade agreements, could, among other things, increase the costs of the materials used by our suppliers to produce new revenue equipment or increase the price of fuel. Such cost increases for our revenue equipment suppliers would likely be passed on to us, and to the extent fuel prices increase, we may not be able to fully recover such increases through rate increases or our fuel surcharge program, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Increasing attention on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may have a negative impact on our business, impose additional costs on us, and expose us to additional risks. 
 Companies are facing increasing attention from stakeholders relating to ESG matters, including environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and diversity and inclusion. Organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment toward the Company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. 
 We recently published our Sustainability Report. This report reflects our current initiatives and is not a guarantee that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives and accurately report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal, reputational and other risks, many of which are outside our control, and all of which could have a material negative impact on our business. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives imposes additional costs on us. If our ESG initiatives fail to satisfy our stakeholders, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment and business partner could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure, or perceived failure, to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. 
 Financial Risk 
 
 We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if our capital investments do not match customer demand for invested resources, we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms. 
 Our full truckload and LTL operations are capital intensive, and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts on capital annually. If anticipated demand differs materially from actual usage, our capital intensive full truckload and LTL operations may have too many or too few assets. The recent expansion of our operations to LTL has increased and will continue to increase our capital requirements for real estate associated with LTL operations. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset utilization may suffer, and we may be forced to sell equipment on the open market or turn in equipment under certain equipment leases in order to right-size our fleet. This could cause us to incur losses on such sales or require payments in connection with such turn-ins, particularly during times of a softer used equipment market, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability. 
 In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, maintain compliance with financial and other covenants in our financing agreements, or obtain equity capital or financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability. 
 If credit markets weaken, it may be difficult for us to access our current sources of credit and may be difficult for our lenders to find the capital to fund us. We may need to incur additional debt, or issue debt or equity securities in the future, to refinance existing debt, fund working capital requirements, make investments, or support other business activities. Declines in consumer confidence, decreases in domestic spending, economic contractions, rating agency actions, and other trends in the credit market may impair our future ability to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. 
 33 

Table of Contents Glossary of Terms 

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC. 

 In the future, we may need to obtain additional financing that may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders. 
 We may need to raise additional funds in order to: 
 finance unanticipated working capital requirements, capital investments, or refinance existing indebtedness; 
 develop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services; 
 fund strategic relationships; 
 respond to competitive pressures; and 
 acquire complementary businesses, technologies, products, or services. 
 If the economy and/or the credit markets weaken, or we are unable to enter into finance or operating leases to acquire revenue equipment on terms favorable to us, our business, financial results, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our strategic initiatives, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders may be reduced, and holders of these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. 
 In the event of an economic downturn or disruption in the credit markets, our indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage in terms of our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. 
 This could have negative consequences that include: 
 increased vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments; 
 cash flows from operations that are committed to payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing our ability to use cash for our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; 
 increased interest rates that would affect our variable rate debt; 
 potential noncompliance with financial covenants, borrowing conditions, and other debt obligations (where applicable); 
 lack of financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, and general corporate or other purposes; and 
 limits on our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, market conditions, or in the economy. 
 Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
 As detailed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we must comply with various affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in default or (when applicable) cross-default. Upon default under our primary credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding amounts to be immediately due and payable, as well as terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross-defaults with our other debt agreements. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could use the collateral granted to satisfy all or part of the debt owed to them. If the lenders accelerated our debt repayments, we might not have sufficient assets to repay all amounts borrowed. 
 In addition, we have other financing that includes certain affirmative and negative covenants and cross-default provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants and provisions may jeopardize our ability to continue to sell receivables under the facility and could negatively impact our liquidity. 
 Our debt agreements contain variable rate debt that could affect the Company s financial results should interest rates continue to rise. 
 We are subject to exposure from variable interest rates, as described in Item 7A of this Annual Report.

 We could determine that our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles are impaired, thus recognizing a related impairment loss. 
 We have goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. Given our history of acquisitions and growth objectives, our goodwill and intangible assets could grow. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. We could recognize impairments in the future, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. If these events occur, our profitability and financial condition will suffer. 
 If our investments in entities are not successful or decrease in market value, we may be required to write off or lose the value of a portion or all of our investments, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Through one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we have directly or indirectly invested in certain entities that make privately negotiated equity investments. In the past, the Company has recorded impairment charges to reflect the other-than-temporary decreases in the fair value of its portfolio. If the financial position of any such entity declines, we could be required to write down all or part of our investment in that entity, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Changes in taxation could lead to an increase of our tax exposure and could affect the Company s financial results. 
 President Biden has provided some informal guidance on what federal tax law changes he supports, such as an increase in the corporate tax rate from its current top rate of 21 . If an increase in the corporate tax rate is passed by Congress and signed into law, it could have a materially adverse effect on our financial results and financial position. At December 31, 2022, the Company has a deferred tax liability of 907.9 million. The amount of deferred tax liability is determined by using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. Accordingly, our net current tax liability has been determined based on the currently enacted rate of 21 . If the current rate were increased due to legislation, it would have an immediate revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the year of enactment. For example, an increase in the tax rate from 21 to 26 would result in the immediate increase in our net deferred tax liability of approximately 180.9 million, with a corresponding increase to income tax expense in the year of enactment to reflect the revaluation.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 Our Knight and Swift headquarters are both located in Phoenix, Arizona. Including Knight's former headquarters location, which was re-purposed as a regional operations facility, our headquarters cover approximately 200 acres, consisting of about 300,000 square feet of office space, 150,000 square feet of repair and maintenance facilities, a twenty thousand square-foot driving associates' center and restaurant, an eight thousand square-foot recruiting and training center, a six thousand square-foot warehouse, a 300-space parking structure, as well as two truck wash and fueling facilities. Our ACT headquarters located in Dothan, Alabama, covers approximately 20 acres of land consisting of about 57,474 square feet of office space, a 2,364 square foot supply warehouse, 37,248 square feet of repair and maintenance facilities, 8,274 square feet of parts warehousing, and a 15,110 square foot loading dock. 
 We have over 210 locations in the US and Mexico, including our headquarters, terminals, driving academies, and certain other locations, which are included in the table below. Our terminals may include customer service, marketing, fuel, and/or repair facilities. Given the fluidity of our operations, and to promote operational efficiency, our terminal properties are used by each of our Truckload, LTL, Logistics, Intermodal, and non-reportable segments. We also own or lease parcels of vacant land, drop yards, and space for temporary trailer storage for ourselves and other carriers, as well as several non-operating facilities, which are excluded from the table below. As of December 31, 2022, our aggregate monthly rent for all leased properties was approximately 2.9 million with varying terms expiring through December 2053. We believe that substantially all of our property is in good condition and our facilities have sufficient capacity to meet our current needs.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. Information about our legal proceedings is included in Note 19 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and is incorporated by reference herein. Based on management's present knowledge of the facts and (in certain cases) advice of outside counsel, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's overall financial position, operating results, or cash flows after taking into account any existing accruals. However, actual outcomes could be material to the Company's financial position, operating results, or cash flows for any particular period.

 Common Stock 
 
 Our common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol "KNX". As of December 31, 2022, we had 160,705,569 shares of common stock outstanding. On February 14, 2023, there were 36 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of individual stockholders represented by the record holders. 
 See "Equity Plan Information" under Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report for certain information concerning shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans. 
 Dividend Policy 
 
 We have paid a quarterly cash dividend as Knight-Swift since December 27, 2017. 
 Our most recent dividend was declared in February of 2023 for 0.14 per share of common stock and is scheduled to be paid in March of 2023. 
 We currently expect to continue to pay comparable quarterly cash dividends in the future. Future payment of cash dividends, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, tax treatment, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board.

 Executive Summary 
 
 Company Overview 
 Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. is one of North America's largest and most diversified freight transportation companies, providing multiple full truckload, LTL, intermodal, and other complementary services. Our objective is to operate our business with industry-leading margins and continued organic growth and growth through acquisitions while providing safe, high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers. Knight-Swift uses a nationwide network of business units and terminals in the US and Mexico to serve customers throughout North America. In addition to operating one of the country's largest truckload fleets, Knight-Swift also contracts with third-party equipment providers to provide a broad range of transportation services to our customers while creating quality driving jobs for our driving associates and successful business opportunities for independent contractors. Our four reportable segments are Truckload, LTL, Logistics, and Intermodal. Additionally, we have various non-reportable segments. 
 Key Financial Highlights 
 During 2022, consolidated total revenue was 7.4 billion, which is a 23.9 increase over 2021. Consolidated operating income was 1.1 billion in 2022, reflecting an increase of 13.1 from 2021. Consolidated net income attributable to Knight-Swift increased by 3.8 from 2021 to 771.3 million. 
 Truckload 83.5 operating ratio during 2022, with a 3.5 increase in revenue, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, compared to 2021. 
 LTL 88.2 operating ratio during 2022 as a result of continued improvements in yields and efficiencies. 
 Logistics 85.5 operating ratio during 2022. Operating income improved by 42.6 . Load count grew by 24.0 , leading to a 14.0 increase in revenue, excluding intersegment transactions. 
 Intermodal 90.1 operating ratio during 2022, a 70 basis point improvement compared to 2021, leading to a 14.5 increase in operating income with revenue growth of 5.9 , excluding intersegment transactions. 
 Non-reportable Segments Revenue growth of 68.6 was supported by the activities within our operating segments of insurance, equipment maintenance, equipment leasing, and warehousing, leading to a 158.9 improvement in operating income to 36.5 million during 2022, compared to 2021. 
 Embark The value of our 2021 initial investment in Embark declined, resulting in an unrealized loss that negatively impacted earnings per diluted share and Adjusted EPS 1 by 0.25 during 2022. 
 Liquidity and Capital During 2022, we generated 1.4 billion in operating cash flows. Our Free Cash Flow 1 was 818.7 million. We paid down 212.7 million in long-term debt, 62.1 million in finance lease liabilities, and 42.9 million in cash on our operating lease liabilities, and reduced the outstanding net balances on our revolving credit facilities by 77.0 million. In 2022, we repurchased approximately 300 million worth of shares, and issued 78.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. Gain on sale of revenue equipment increased to 92.9 million in 2022, compared to 74.8 million in 2021. 
 We ended 2022 with 196.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, 43.0 million outstanding on the 2021 Revolver, 1.0 billion face value outstanding on the 2021 Term Loans, and 7.0 billion of stockholders' equity. We do not foresee material liquidity constraints or any issues with our ongoing ability to meet our debt covenants. See discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.

 1 Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Operating Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered alternatives, or superior to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. However, management believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Operating Ratio are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures," below. 
 2 Our tractor fleet within the Truckload segment had a weighted average age of 2.7 years and 2.5 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 3 Note that average trailers includes 8,249 and 6,388 trailers within our non-reportable operating segments. Our trailer fleet within the Truckload segment had a weighted average age of 9.9 years and 8.3 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 4 Our LTL tractor fleet had a weighted average age of 4.3 years as of December 31, 2022, and includes 711 and 667 tractors from ACT's and MME's dedicated and other businesses for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Market Trends and Outlook On a year-over-year basis, the US gross domestic product, which is the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, increased by 2.1 1 in 2022, as compared to a 5.7 1 decrease in 2021. The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects increases in consumer spending, exports, and inventory investment that were partly offset by a decrease in housing investment. The national unemployment rate was 3.5 2 as of December 31, 2022, as compared to 3.9 2 as of December 31, 2021. Early estimates of the full-year 2022 US employment cost index indicate a year-over-year increase of 5.1 2 and a sequential increase of 1.0 2 . 
 The freight market outlook for 2023 includes the following: 
 Continued softness in freight demand with few non-contract opportunities through the first half of 2023 as shippers work through higher inventory levels; 
 Freight volumes improve in the second half of the year with a more typical peak season; 
 Spot pricing troughs in the first quarter of 2023 and builds throughout the year; 
 Demand continues for trailer pools; 
 Small carriers continue to exit as a result of lower spot rates and significantly higher operating costs; 
 LTL demand pressured but remains more stable than truckload; 
 LTL year-over-year improvement in revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, per hundredweight; 
 Inflationary pressures ease in many cost areas but remain elevated on a year-over-year basis; 
 Demand in the used equipment market weakens as small carriers struggle; 
 We expect the driver market to remain competitive throughout 2023.

Results of Operations Summary 
 Notes regarding presentation: A discussion of changes in our results of operations from 2020 to 2021 has been omitted from this Annual Report, but may be found in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2021 Annual Report filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. 
 In accordance with accounting treatment applicable to each of our recent acquisitions, Knight-Swift's reported results do not include the operating results of the acquired entities prior to the respective acquisition dates. Accordingly, comparisons between the Company's 2022 results and prior periods may not be meaningful. Refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a list of our recent acquisitions. 
 Operating Results: 2022 Compared to 2021 The 27.9 million increase in net income attributable to Knight-Swift to 771.3 million in 2022 from 743.4 million in 2021, includes the following: 
 Contributor 95.4 million increase in operating income from our LTL segment representing ACT's and MME's full year 2022 results, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. 
 Contributor 40.0 million increase in operating income within our Logistics segment driven by a 24.0 increase in load count. 
 Contributor 6.1 million increase in operating income within our Intermodal segment driven by a 24.3 increase in revenue per load, partially offset by a 14.8 decrease in load count. 
 Contributor 22.4 million improvement in operating results within our non-reportable segments, driven by revenue growth of 68.6 related to our expanded services to third-party carriers. 
 Offset 37.9 million decrease in operating income within our Truckload segment as a result of a 6.3 decrease in total miles per tractor. 
 Offset 54.9 million decrease in "Other (expenses) income, net," primarily due to unrealized losses recognized from our investment in Embark, compared to a gain during 2021. 
 Offset 18.5 million increase in consolidated income tax expense, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. This resulted in a 2022 effective tax rate of 24.4 and a 2021 effective tax rate of 23.7 . 
 See additional discussion of our operating results within "Results of Operations Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses" below. 
 
 Results of Operations Segment Review

 Revenue 
 Our truckload services include irregular route and dedicated, refrigerated, expedited, flatbed, and cross-border transportation of various products, goods, and materials for our diverse customer base with approximately 13,400 irregular route and 4,700 dedicated tractors. 
 Our LTL business, which was initially established in 2021 through the ACT Acquisition and later the MME acquisition, provides our customers with regional LTL transportation service through our growing network of approximately 110 facilities and a door count of approximately 4,400. Our LTL segment operates approximately 3,200 tractors and approximately 8,400 trailers, including equipment used for ACT's and MME's dedicated and other businesses. The LTL segment also provides national coverage to our customers by utilizing partner carriers for areas outside of our direct network. 
 Our Logistics and Intermodal segments provide a multitude of shipping solutions, including additional sources of truckload capacity and alternative transportation modes, by utilizing our vast network of third-party capacity providers and rail providers, as well as certain logistics and freight management services. We continue to offer power-only services through our Logistics segment by leveraging our fleet of over 79,000 trailers as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our non-reportable segments include support services provided to our customers and third-party carriers including insurance, equipment maintenance, equipment leasing, warehousing, trailer parts manufacturing, and warranty services. Our non-reportable segments also include certain corporate expenses (such as legal settlements and accruals, certain impairments, and amortization of intangibles related to the 2017 Merger and various acquisitions). 
 In addition to the revenues earned from our customers for the trucking and non-trucking services discussed above, we also earn fuel surcharge revenue from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs, which serve to recover a majority of our fuel costs. This generally applies only to loaded miles for our Truckload and LTL segments and typically does not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, and out-of-route miles driven. Fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in fuel surcharge revenue. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in fuel surcharge revenue for our Truckload and LTL segments. 
 Expenses 
 Our most significant expenses typically vary with miles traveled and include fuel, driving associate-related expenses (such as wages and benefits), and services purchased from third-party service providers (including other trucking companies, railroad and drayage providers, and independent contractors). Maintenance and tire expenses, as well as the cost of insurance and claims generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety performance, fleet age, operating efficiency, and other factors. Our primary fixed costs are depreciation and lease expense for revenue equipment and terminals, non-driver employee compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and interest expenses.

Operating Statistics 
 We measure our consolidated and segment results through the operating statistics listed in the table below. Our chief operating decision makers monitor the GAAP results of our reportable segments, supplemented by certain non-GAAP information. Refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more details. Additionally, we use a number of primary indicators to monitor our revenue and expense performance and efficiency.

Segment Review 
 Truckload Segment 
 We generate revenue in the Truckload segment primarily through irregular route, dedicated, refrigerated, flatbed, expedited, and cross-border service offerings, with approximately 13,400 irregular route tractors and approximately 4,700 dedicated route tractors in use during 2022. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our truckload services. Additional revenues are generated by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, dedicated services, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharge revenue to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that affect the revenue generated by our Truckload segment are rate per mile from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of loaded miles we generate with our equipment. 
 The most significant expenses in the Truckload segment are primarily variable and include fuel and fuel taxes, driving associate-related expenses (such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment), and costs associated with independent contractors primarily included in "Purchased transportation" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Maintenance expense (which includes costs for replacement tires for our revenue equipment) and insurance and claims expenses have both fixed and variable components. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. The main fixed costs in the Truckload segment are depreciation and rent expenses from tractors, trailers, and terminals, as well as compensating our non-driver employees.

 2022 Compared to 2021 The Truckload segment's Adjusted Operating Ratio increased by 170 basis points to 80.4 in 2022, as compared to 2021. Revenue, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions was 3.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 3.5 . Revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharge and intersegment transactions, increased 11.4 year-over-year, while total miles decreased 5.8 , reflecting softer freight demand. These factors ultimately led to a 3.0 increase in average revenue per tractor. 
 We continue to add scale by increasing our trailer count, which has grown to approximately 79,000 trailers as of the end of 2022. We believe this positions us to provide valuable capacity to our customers through our Truckload and Logistics segments. We remain focused on managing costs and improving utilization, as we expect inflationary pressures in driver-related costs, equipment maintenance, and insurance to continue to affect the freight market in the first half of 2023.

LTL Segment 
 Dothan, Alabama-based ACT and Bismarck, North Dakota-based MME, both acquired in 2021, comprise our LTL segment. We provide regional direct service and serve our customers' national transportation needs by utilizing key partner carriers for coverage areas outside of our network. We primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers through our core LTL services. 
 Our revenues are impacted by shipment volume and tonnage levels that flow through our network. Additional revenues are generated through fuel surcharges and accessorial services provided during transit from shipment origin to destination. We focus on the following multiple revenue generation factors when reviewing revenue yield: revenue per hundredweight, revenue per shipment, weight per shipment, and length of haul. Fluctuations within each of these metrics are analyzed when determining the revenue quality of our customers' shipment density. 
 Our most significant expense is related to direct costs associated with the transportation of our freight moves including; direct salary, wage and benefit costs, fuel expense, and depreciation expense associated with revenue equipment costs. Other expenses associated with revenue generation that can fluctuate and impact operating results are insurance and claims expense, as well as maintenance costs of our revenue equipment. These expenses can be influenced by multiple factors including our safety performance, equipment age, and other factors. A key component to lowering our operating costs is labor efficiency within our network. We continue to focus on technological advances to improve the customer experience and reduce our operating costs. 
 Note: In accordance with the accounting treatment applicable to the ACT and MME acquisitions, the LTL segment's reported results do not include the operating results of the acquired entities prior to the respective acquisition dates.

Our LTL segment operates across approximately 110 facilities with a door count of over 4,400. We generated 867 million in revenue, excluding fuel surcharge and an 83.6 Adjusted Operating Ratio during 2022 in the LTL segment. Revenue, excluding fuel surcharge, per hundredweight was 14.25, while revenue per shipment, excluding fuel surcharge, was 152.15. 
 The ACT and MME teams continue to achieve both customer and cost synergies. Also, during the fourth quarter, the operational systems were converted to allow freight movement through one connected network across both LTL brands. While the system conversion impacted volumes at MME for a period of time, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage the freight opportunities across the connected network with existing and new customers. 
 We expect that our connected LTL network will provide additional opportunities for revenue growth. During 2022, we increased our door count by over 180 and we expect door capacity to continue to grow in 2023. We remain encouraged by the strong performance within our LTL segment, and we continue to look for both organic and inorganic opportunities to geographically expand our footprint within the LTL market. 
 
 Logistics Segment 
 The Logistics segment is less asset-intensive than the Truckload and LTL segments and is dependent upon capable non-driver employees, modern and effective information technology, and third-party capacity providers. Logistics revenue is generated by its brokerage operations. We generate additional revenue by offering specialized logistics solutions (including, but not limited to, trailing equipment, origin management, surge volume, disaster relief, special projects, and other logistic needs). Logistics revenue is mainly affected by the rates we obtain from customers, the freight volumes we ship through third-party capacity providers, and our ability to secure third-party capacity providers to transport customer freight. 
 The most significant expense in the Logistics segment is purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers, which is a primarily variable cost, and is included in "Purchased transportation" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Variability in this expense depends on truckload capacity, availability of third-party capacity providers, rates charged to customers, current freight demand, and customer shipping needs. Fixed Logistics operating expenses primarily include non-driver employee compensation and benefits recorded in "Salaries, wages, and benefits" and depreciation and amortization expense recorded in "Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Intermodal Segment 
 The Intermodal segment complements our regional operating model, allows us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes, and reduces our investment in fixed assets. Through the Intermodal segment, we generate revenue by moving freight over the rail in our containers and other trailing equipment, combined with revenue for drayage to transport loads between railheads and customer locations. The most significant expense in the Intermodal segment is the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party capacity providers (including rail providers), which is primarily variable and included in "Purchased transportation" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. While rail pricing is determined on an annual basis, purchased transportation varies as it relates to rail capacity, freight demand, and customer shipping needs. The main fixed costs in the Intermodal segment are depreciation of our company tractors related to drayage, containers, and chassis, as well as non-driver employee compensation and benefits.

 2022 Compared to 2021 Revenue grew by 5.9 while the operating ratio improved from 90.8 in 2021 to 90.1 in 2022, resulting in a 6.1 million increase in operating income. Intermodal experienced a 24.3 increase in revenue per load, which was partially offset by a decrease in load count due to softer freight demand and labor challenges across the rail industry. 
 As a result of our network and improved service offerings, we expect to continue to grow with new customers and expand with existing customers. To position Intermodal for continued growth, we increased our average container count by approximately 1,600 in 2022. We remain focused on growing our load count and improving the efficiency of our assets as Intermodal continues to provide value to our customers and is complementary to the many services we offer. 
 
 Non-reportable Segments 
 Our non-reportable segments include support services provided to our customers and third-party carriers including insurance, equipment maintenance, equipment leasing, warehousing, trailer parts manufacturing, and warranty services. Our non-reportable segments also include certain corporate expenses (such as legal settlements and accruals, certain impairments, and 46.4 million in annual amortization of intangibles related to the 2017 Merger and various acquisitions).

Results of Operations Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses 
 
 Consolidated Operating Expenses 
 The following tables present certain operating expenses from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, including each operating expense as a percentage of total revenue and as a percentage of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge. Truckload and LTL fuel surcharge revenue can be volatile and is primarily dependent upon the cost of fuel, rather than operating expenses unrelated to fuel. Therefore, we believe that revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge is a better measure for analyzing many of our expenses and operating metrics. 
 Note: In accordance with the accounting treatment applicable to each of our recent acquisitions, Knight-Swift's reported results do not include the operating results of the acquired entities prior to the respective acquisition dates. Accordingly, comparisons between the Company's 2022 results and prior periods may not be meaningful. Refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a list of our recent acquisitions. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 
 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Salaries, wages, and benefits 2,173,933 1,771,772 22.7 of total revenue 29.3 29.5 (20 bps) of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 33.4 32.0 140 bps 
 Salaries, wages, and benefits expense is primarily affected by the total number of miles driven by and rates we pay to our company driving associates, and employee benefits including healthcare, workers' compensation, and other benefits. To a lesser extent, non-driver employee headcount, compensation, and benefits affect this expense. Driving associate wages represent the largest component of salaries, wages, and benefits expense. 
 Several ongoing market factors have reduced the pool of available driving associates, contributing to a challenging driver sourcing market, which we believe will continue. Having a sufficient number of qualified driving associates is a significant headwind, although we continue to seek ways to attract and retain qualified driving associates, including heavily investing in our recruiting efforts, our driving academies, technology, our equipment, and our terminals that improve the experience of driving associates. We expect labor costs (related to both driving associates and non-driver employees) to remain inflationary, which we expect will result in additional pay increases in the future, thereby increasing our salaries, wages, and benefits expense. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated salaries, wages, and benefits includes a 309.6 million increase from the results of ACT and MME for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. The remaining increase pertained to driving associate pay rates, and an increase in non-driver headcount, resulting in higher non-driver salaries, wages, and benefits. These increases were partially offset by a 6.2 reduction in miles driven by company driving associates, excluding ACT and MME. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Fuel 895,603 546,256 64.0 of total revenue 12.1 9.1 300 bps of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 13.8 9.9 390 bps 
 Fuel expense consists primarily of diesel fuel expense for our company-owned tractors. The primary factors affecting our fuel expense are the cost of diesel fuel, the fuel economy of our equipment, and the miles driven by company driving associates.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

Our fuel surcharge programs help to offset increases in fuel prices, but generally apply only to loaded miles for our Truckload and LTL segments and typically do not offset non-paid empty miles, idle time, or out-of-route miles driven. Typical fuel surcharge programs involve a computation based on the change in national or regional fuel prices. These programs may update as often as weekly, but typically require a specified minimum change in fuel cost to prompt a change in fuel surcharge revenue for our Truckload and LTL segments. Therefore, many of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when the change is reflected in fuel surcharge revenue. Due to this time lag, our fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge, negatively impacts our operating income during periods of sharply rising fuel costs and positively impacts our operating income during periods of falling fuel costs. We continue to utilize our fuel efficiency initiatives such as trailer blades, idle-control, management of tractor speeds, fleet updates for more fuel-efficient engines, management of fuel procurement, and driving associate training programs that we believe contribute to controlling our fuel expense. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated fuel expense includes a 71.8 million increase from the results of ACT for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the acquisition date. The remaining difference is primarily due to an increase in the average DOE fuel price to 5.01 per gallon in 2022 from 3.29 per gallon in 2021, partially offset by a 6.2 reduction in the total miles driven by company driving associates, excluding ACT. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Operations and maintenance 422,872 313,505 34.9 of total revenue 5.7 5.2 50 bps of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 6.5 5.7 80 bps 
 Operations and maintenance expense consists of direct operating expenses, such as driving associate hiring and recruiting expenses, equipment maintenance, and tire expense. Operations and maintenance expenses are typically affected by the age of our company-owned fleet of tractors and trailers and the miles driven. We expect the driver market to remain competitive throughout 2023, which could increase future driving associate development and recruiting costs and negatively affect our operations and maintenance expense. We expect to continue refreshing our tractor fleet in the coming quarters, subject to availability of new revenue equipment, to maintain or improve the average age of our equipment. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated operations and maintenance expense includes a 29.3 million increase from the results of ACT for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the acquisition date. The remaining increase was attributed to higher maintenance expenses due to an increase in the average age of our fleet, higher port per diem expenses as we navigate a backlog of shipping containers at ports, and increased hiring expenses as we work to improve our seated truck count.

2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Insurance and claims 455,918 275,378 65.6 of total revenue 6.1 4.6 150 bps of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 7.0 5.0 200 bps 
 Insurance and claims expense consists of premiums for liability, physical damage, and cargo, and will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims, our level of self-insurance, and premium expense. In recent years, insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including transportation companies, and as a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase in the future, or we could raise our self-insured retention limits or reduce excess coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. In 2021, we expanded our insurance offerings to third-party carriers, earning additional premium revenues, which were partially offset by increased insurance reserves. Insurance and claims expense also varies based on the number of miles driven by company driving associates and independent contractors, the frequency and severity of accidents, trends in development factors used in actuarial accruals, and developments in large, prior-year claims. In future periods, our higher self-insured retention limits or lower excess coverage limits may cause increased volatility in our consolidated insurance and claims expense. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 Consolidated insurance and claims expense increased partially due to the inclusion of 18.4 million of insurance and claims expense from the results of ACT for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the acquisition date. The remaining increase was primarily due to insurance reserves incurred through our expanded third-party carrier insurance program in 2022. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Operating taxes and licenses 111,197 98,784 12.6 of total revenue 1.5 1.6 (10 bps) of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 1.7 1.8 (10 bps) 
 Operating taxes and licenses include state franchise taxes, state and federal highway use taxes, property taxes, vehicle license and registration fees, and fuel and mileage taxes, among others. The expense is impacted by changes in the tax rates and registration fees associated with our tractor fleet and regional operating facilities. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated operating taxes and licenses expense is primarily due to the inclusion of operating taxes and licenses expense from ACT's and MME's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Communications 23,656 22,486 5.2 of total revenue 0.3 0.4 (10 bps) of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 0.4 0.4 bps 
 Communications expense is comprised of costs associated with our tractor and trailer tracking systems, information technology systems, and phone systems. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated communications expense is primarily due to the inclusion of 2.2 million of communications expense from ACT's and MME's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. This increase was partially offset by the implementation of new technology on our revenue equipment.

2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 594,981 522,596 13.9 of total revenue 8.0 8.7 (70 bps) of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 9.1 9.4 (30 bps) 
 Depreciation relates primarily to our owned tractors, trailers, buildings, electronic logging devices, other communication units, and other similar assets. Changes to this fixed cost are generally attributed to increases or decreases to company-owned equipment, the relative percentage of owned versus leased equipment, and fluctuations in new equipment purchase prices. Depreciation can also be affected by the cost of used equipment that we sell or trade and the replacement of older used equipment. Management periodically reviews the condition, average age, and reasonableness of estimated useful lives and salvage values of our equipment and considers such factors in light of our experience with similar assets, used equipment market conditions, and prevailing industry practices. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment includes a 34.7 million increase of expense from ACT's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the acquisition date. The remaining increase is primarily due to an increase in owned versus leased equipment and higher depreciation for capital improvements made to our terminals. 
 We expect consolidated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment to increase both in total and as a percentage of consolidated revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge, as we currently do not plan to use operating leases as a primary means of funding our equipment purchases, terminal improvements, or terminal expansions in 2023. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Amortization of intangibles 64,843 55,299 17.3 of total revenue 0.9 0.9 bps of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 1.0 1.0 bps 
 Amortization of intangibles relates to intangible assets identified with the 2017 Merger, ACT Acquisition and other acquisitions. See Note 4 and Note 10 in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report for further details regarding the Company's intangible assets, historical amortization, and anticipated future amortization. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated amortization of intangibles for 2022 is attributed to the ACT, MME, UTXL, and Eleos acquisitions in 2021. See Note 4 in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report for more details regarding our acquisitions.

2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Rental expense 56,856 55,161 3.1 of total revenue 0.8 0.9 (10 bps) of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 0.9 1.0 (10 bps) 
 Rental expense consists primarily of payments for tractors and trailers financed with operating leases. The primary factors affecting the expense are the size of our revenue equipment fleet and the relative percentage of owned versus leased equipment. 
 2022 Compa red to 2021 The increase in consolidated rental expense was primarily due to a 4.7 million increase in expense from ACT's and MME's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. This increase was partially offset by increasing our ratio of owned versus leased equipment. 
 We expect consolidated rental expense to continue to decrease both in total and as a percentage of consolidated revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge, as we currently do not plan to use operating leases as a primary means of funding our equipment purchases in 2023. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Purchased transportation 1,444,937 1,320,888 9.4 of total revenue 19.5 22.0 (250 bps) of revenue, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge 22.2 23.9 (170 bps) 
 Purchased transportation expense is comprised of payments to independent contractors in our trucking operations, as well as payments to third-party capacity providers related to logistics, freight management, and non-trucking services in our logistics and intermodal businesses. Purchased transportation is generally affected by capacity in the market as well as changes in fuel prices. As capacity tightens, our payments to third-party capacity providers and to independent contractors tend to increase. Additionally, as fuel prices increase, payments to third-party capacity providers and independent contractors increase. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated purchased transportation expense is primarily due to increased load volumes within our logistics business and inflationary pressures related to services provided by our third party carriers. Purchased transportation expense also includes a 14.0 million increase in expense from ACT's and MME's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. 
 We expect that consolidated purchased transportation will increase as a percentage of revenue if we grow our logistics and intermodal businesses faster than our full truckload and LTL businesses. The increase could be partially offset if independent contractors exit the market due to regulatory changes. 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Impairments 810 299 170.9 
 2022 Compared to 2021 In 2022, we incurred impairment charges associated with building improvements (within our non-reportable segments). In 2021, we incurred impairment charges associated with revenue equipment held for sale and trailer tracking systems (within our Truckload and non-reportable segments).

 Miscellaneous operating expenses primarily consists of legal and professional services fees, general and administrative expenses, and other costs, net of gain on sales of equipment. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in net consolidated miscellaneous operating expenses includes 20.7 million of additional expense in 2022 from ACT's and MME's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. Net consolidated miscellaneous operating expenses also include a net increase in legal settlements expense of 3.3 million, and higher operating expense associated with increased travel time and return to work programs. These increases were partially offset by an 18.1 million year-over-year increase in gain on sales of equipment, including a 2.3 million increase from ACT reflected in the net increase noted above. 
 Consolidated Other Expenses, net 
 The following table summarizes fluctuations in certain non-operating expenses included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income: 
 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) Interest income (5,439) (1,173) 363.7 Interest expense 50,803 21,140 140.3 Other expenses (income), net 25,958 (28,905) (189.8 Income tax expense 249,388 230,887 8.0 
 Interest income Interest income includes interest earned from financing revenue equipment to independent contractors, as well as interest earned from our investments. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated interest income is primarily due to the higher balances in our interest yielding cash accounts, coupled with an increase in interest rates during 2022. 
 Interest expense Interest expense is comprised of debt and finance lease interest expense as well as amortization of deferred loan costs. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 Consolidated interest expense increased due to higher overall debt balances and an increase in interest rates during 2022. See Note 15 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information related to the 2021 Debt Agreement and related interest rates and deferred loan costs. 
 Other expenses (income), net Other expenses (income), net is primarily comprised of losses and (gains) from our various equity investments, including our investment in Embark, as well as certain other non-operating income and expense items that may arise outside of the normal course of business. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The unfavorable change in consolidated other expenses (income), net is primarily due to unrealized losses recognized from our investment in Embark, compared to a gain during 2021. 
 Income tax expense In addition to the discussion below, Note 13 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report provides further analysis related to income taxes. 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The increase in consolidated income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. This resulted in a 2022 effective tax rate of 24.4 and a 2021 effective tax rate of 23.7 .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The terms "Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift," "Adjusted EPS," "Adjusted Operating Income," "Adjusted Operating Ratio," and "Free Cash Flow," as we define them, are not presented in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures supplement our GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business. We believe that using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because they remove the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Management and the Board focus on Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Income, and Adjusted Operating Ratio as key measures of our performance, all of which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures and further discussed below. Management and the Board use Free Cash Flow as a key measure of our liquidity. Free Cash Flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance. 
 Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Knight-Swift, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Free Cash Flow are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, cash flows from operating activities, operating income, or other measures prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that they improve comparability in analyzing our period to period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry if those companies define these measures differently. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis. 
 Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the following tables reconcile GAAP consolidated net income attributable to Knight-Swift to non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted Net Income attributable to Knight-Swift, GAAP consolidated earnings per diluted share to non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EPS, GAAP consolidated operating ratio to non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted Operating Ratio, GAAP reportable segment operating income to non-GAAP reportable segment Adjusted Operating Income, GAAP reportable segment operating ratio to non-GAAP reportable segment Adjusted Operating Ratio, and GAAP cash flow from operations to non-GAAP Free Cash Flow.

Additional 2022 legal costs relate to certain lawsuits arising from employee and contract related matters. 
 During 2021, the reversal of an accrued legal matter previously identified as probable in 2019 was based on a recent decision of the appellate court, resulting in a change to a remote likelihood that a loss was incurred. Additional 2021 legal costs relate to certain class action lawsuits arising from employee and contract related matters. 
 4 "Transaction fees" consisted of legal and professional fees associated with the acquisitions of UTXL, ACT, and MME. The transaction fees are included within "Miscellaneous operating expenses" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 5 "Write-off of deferred debt issuance costs" was incurred from replacing the 2017 Debt Agreement with the 2021 Debt Agreement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 The following table presents our available sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2022: 
 Source: Amount (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash 196,770 Availability under 2021 Revolver, due September 2026 1 
 1,041,186 Availability under 2021 RSA, due April 2024 2 
 37,400 Total unrestricted liquidity 1,275,356 Cash and cash equivalents restricted 3 
 188,575 Restricted investments, held-to-maturity, amortized cost 3 
 7,175 Total liquidity, including restricted cash and restricted investments 1,471,106 
 1 As of December 31, 2022, we had 43.0 million in borrowings under our 1.1 billion 2021 Revolver. We additionally had 15.8 million in outstanding letters of credit (discussed below) issued under the 2021 Revolver, leaving 1.0 billion available under the 2021 Revolver. 
 2 Based on eligible receivables at December 31, 2022, our borrowing base for the 2021 RSA was 456.4 million, while outstanding borrowings were 419.0 million, leaving 37.4 million available under the 2021 RSA. 
 3 Restricted cash and restricted investments are primarily held by our captive insurance companies for claims payments. "Cash and cash equivalents restricted" consists of 185.8 million, which is included in "Cash and cash equivalents restricted" in the consolidated balance sheets and is held by Mohave and Red Rock for claims payments. The remaining 2.8 million is included in "Other long-term assets" and is held in escrow accounts to meet statutory requirements. 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 Our business requires substantial amounts of cash for operating activities, including salaries and wages paid to our employees, contract payments to independent contractors, insurance and claims payments, tax payments, and others. We also use large amounts of cash and credit for the following activities: 
 Capital Expenditures When justified by customer demand, as well as our liquidity and our ability to generate acceptable returns, we make substantial cash capital expenditures to maintain a modern company tractor fleet, refresh our trailer fleet, expand our network of LTL service centers, and, to a lesser extent, fund upgrades to our terminals and technology in our various service offerings. We expect net cash capital expenditures, including net cash expenditures of our LTL segment, will be in the range of 640.0 to 690.0 million in 2023. The range provided excludes cash outlays for potential acquisitions. We believe we have ample flexibility with our trade cycle and purchase agreements to alter our current plans if economic or other conditions warrant. 
 Over the long-term, we will continue to have significant capital requirements, which may require us to seek additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital. The availability of financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions. If such additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital is not available at the time we need it, then we may need to borrow more under the 2021 Revolver (if not then fully drawn), extend the maturity of then-outstanding debt, rely on alternative financing arrangements, engage in asset sales, limit our fleet size, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt under our existing financial arrangements to satisfy our ongoing capital requirements. However, we believe the combination of our expected cash flows, financing available through operating and finance leases, available funds under our accounts receivable securitization, and availability under the 2021 Revolver will be sufficient to fund our expected capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
 Refer to Note 18 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our short-term and long-term contractual payment obligations related to purchase commitments.

Principal and Interest Payments As of December 31, 2022, we had debt, accounts receivable securitization, and finance lease obligations of 1.9 billion, which are discussed under "Material Debt Agreements," below. Certain cash flows from operations are committed to minimum payments of principal and interest on our debt and lease obligations. Additionally, when our financial position allows, we periodically make voluntary prepayments on our outstanding debt balances. 
 Prior to the maturity of our 2022 RSA, 2021 Term Loans, 2021 Revolver, Prudential Notes, and other debt, we expect to be contractually obligated to make interest payments of approximately 58.8 million, 156.9 million, 8.5 million, 2.8 million, and 0.1 million, respectively. Refer to Notes 14 and 15 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the principal payment obligations related to the 2021 RSA and 2021 Debt Agreement. 
 Refer to Note 16 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion on our contractual principal and interest payment obligations for finance leases. 
 Letters of Credit Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Debt Agreement and the 2021 RSA, our lenders may issue standby letters of credit on our behalf. When we have certain letters of credit outstanding, it reduces the availability under our 2021 Revolver or 2021 RSA. Standby letters of credit are typically issued for the benefit of regulatory authorities, insurance companies and state departments of insurance for the purpose of satisfying certain collateral requirements, primarily related to our automobile, workers' compensation, and general insurance liabilities. 
 Share Repurchases From time to time, and depending on free cash flow availability, debt levels, stock prices, general economic and market conditions, as well as Board approval, we may repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock. The 2022 Knight-Swift Repurchase Plan had 200.0 million available as of December 31, 2022. See further details regarding our share repurchases under Note 20 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 
 Working Capital 
 We had working capital surpluses of 599.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 339.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The 260.1 million increase was primarily due to the maturity and repayment of our 2021 Term Loan A-1 in December 2022. 
 Material Debt Agreements 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1.9 billion in material debt obligations at the following carrying values: 
 199.8 million: 2021 Term Loan A-2, due September 2024, net of 0.2 million in deferred loan costs 
 798.7 million: 2021 Term Loan A-3, due September 2026, net of 1.3 million in deferred loan costs 
 418.6 million: 2022 RSA outstanding borrowings, net of 0.4 million in deferred loan costs 
 403.0 million: Finance lease obligations 
 43.0 million: 2021 Revolver, due September 2026 
 39.0 million: Other, net of 0.1 million in deferred loan costs 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 2.1 billion in material debt obligations at the following carrying values: 
 199.7 million: 2021 Term Loan A-1, due December 2022, net of 0.3 million in deferred loan costs 
 199.6 million: 2021 Term Loan A-2, due September 2024, net of 0.4 million in deferred loan costs 
 798.4 million: 2021 Term Loan A-3, due September 2026, net of 1.6 million in deferred loan costs 
 278.5 million: 2021 RSA outstanding borrowings, due April 2024, net of 0.5 million in deferred loan costs 
 306.2 million: Finance lease obligations 
 260.0 million: 2021 Revolver, due September 2026 
 52.3 million: Other, net of 0.1 million in deferred loan costs 
 Key terms and other details regarding our material debt obligations and finance leases are discussed in Notes 14, 15, and 16 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, and are incorporated by reference herein.

Cash Flow Analysis 
 
 2022 2021 Change (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,435,853 1,190,153 245,700 Net cash used in investing activities (646,184) (1,816,733) 1,170,549 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (754,347) 779,326 (1,533,673) 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The 245.7 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a 126.1 million increase in operating income and a non-cash increase in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment of 81.9 million. These increases were related to the addition of ACT's and MME's results for the full year 2022, compared to the portion of 2021 following the respective acquisition dates. The remaining increase is due to various changes in working capital and was partially offset by a 122.1 million increase in taxes paid. Note: Factors affecting the increase in operating income are discussed in "Results of Operations Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses." 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 2022 Compared to 2021 The 1.2 billion decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 1.5 billion decrease in net cash invested in acquisitions and was partially offset by a 335.1 million increase in net cash capital expenditures, including 2022 investing activities of ACT and MME. 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 
 2022 Compared to 2021 Net cash used in financing activities increased by 1.5 billion, primarily due to a 1.2 billion reduction in debt proceeds, a 267.0 million increase in net repayments on our 2021 Revolver, and a 242.8 million increase in repurchases of our common stock. 
 Inflation 
 
 Most of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally leading to increased costs of operations. Price increases in manufacturer revenue equipment has impacted the cost for us to acquire new equipment. Cost increases have also impacted the cost of parts for equipment repairs and maintenance. The qualified driver shortage experienced by the trucking industry overall has had the effect of increasing compensation paid to our driving associates. We have also experienced inflation in insurance and claims cost related to health insurance and claims as well as auto liability insurance and claims. Prolonged periods of inflation have recently and could continue to cause interest rates, fuel, wages, and other costs to increase as well. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates correspondingly increase. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported using differing estimates or assumptions. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements. 
 Note 2 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report describes the Company's accounting policies. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 2, as it presents uncertainties involved in applying the accounting policies, and provides insight into the quality of management's estimates and variability in the amounts recorded for these critical accounting estimates. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Claims Accruals Insurance and claims expense varies as a percentage of total revenue, based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period, as well as changes in claims development trends. The actual cost to settle our self-insured claim liabilities, as well as our third-party claim liabilities, may differ from our reserve estimates due to legal costs, claims that have been incurred but not reported, and various other uncertainties, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of the claim and the potential judgment or settlement amount to dispose of the claim. If claims development factors that are based upon historical experience had increased by 10 , our claims accrual as of December 31, 2022 would have potentially increased by 70.1 million. 
 Refer to Note 12, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the changes in the claims accrual balance. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets The test of goodwill requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets (including goodwill) and liabilities to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of comparative valuation multiples of publicly traded companies, internal transaction methods, and discounted cash flow models. Estimating the fair value of reporting units includes several significant assumptions, including future cash flow estimates, determination of appropriate discount rates, and other assumptions that management believed reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. 
 Knight-Swift evaluated its goodwill associated with the 2017 Merger and various acquisitions as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. The evaluations were completed using fair value measurement guidance prescribed in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The fair value of the goodwill was established using an equal weighting of both the income and market approaches. In evaluating this quantitative analysis, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that fair value exceeded carrying value for the Company's reporting units as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. 
 The test of indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of certain trade names to their carrying values. The determination of the fair value of the trade names requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, discount rates, and royalty rates. Changes in these assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value of the trade names, the amount of any trade names impairment charge, or both. M anagement evaluated trade names for impairment as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 noting that the fair value exceeded carrying value for the trade name. 
 Refer to Note 10, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the changes in the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Selecting the appropriate accounting method requires management judgment, as there are multiple acceptable methods that are in accordance with GAAP, including straight-line, declining-balance, and sum-of-the-years' digits. As discussed in Note 2 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis and intangible customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We believe that these methods properly spread the costs over the useful lives of the assets. Management judgment is also involved when determining estimated useful lives of the Company's long-lived assets. We determine useful lives of our long-lived assets, based on historical experience, as well as future expectations regarding the period we expect to benefit from the asset. Factors affecting estimated useful lives of property and equipment may include estimating loss, damage, obsolescence, and company policies around maintenance and asset replacement. Factors affecting estimated useful lives of long-lived intangible assets may include legal, contractual, or other provisions that limit useful lives, historical experience with similar assets, future expectations of customer relationships, among others. 
 Refer to Note 10, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the impact of the amortization of definite-lived intangibles on our results for 2022 and 2021. 
 Impairments of Long-lived Assets Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as necessary. Estimating fair value includes several significant assumptions, including future cash flow estimates, determination of appropriate discount rates, and other assumptions that management believed reasonable under the circumstances.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. 
 Refer to Note 23, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the changes in long-lived assets and the impact on our results for 2022 and 2021. 
 Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. We periodically assess the likelihood that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe the likelihood of recovery is not sufficient, a valuation allowance is established for the amount determined not to be realizable. Management judgment is necessary in determining the frequency at which we assess the need for a valuation allowance, the accounting period in which to establish the valuation allowance, as well as the amount of the valuation allowance. We believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law. However, should our tax positions be challenged, different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Management judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors including the appropriateness of tax strategies. We utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall income taxes. It is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed, resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs, in the event that tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities. An ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Refer to Note 13, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the changes in the balances of deferred taxes assets and related valuation allowances. 
 Leases At the inception of a lease, management judgment is involved in the determination of the discount rate, the determination of whether a contract contains a lease, classification of operating versus finance lease, assessment of useful lives, and estimation of residual values. Discounted future minimum lease payments are used in determining the lease classification represent the present value of minimum rental payments called for over the lease term, inclusive of residual value guarantees (if applicable) and amounts that would be required to be paid, if any, by the Company upon default for leases containing subjective acceleration or cross default clauses. 
 Refer to Note 16, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the changes in balance of operating leases. 
 Stock-based Compensation We issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest, based on service conditions, performance conditions, or a combination of service and performance conditions. Determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achievement of the stated targets for performance-based awards, and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results, market performance, and other factors. The estimates are revised periodically, based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets, and adjustments are made as appropriate. There is also some judgement involved with estimating expected forfeiture rates as we have opted to net the benefit of expected forfeitures against our stock-based compensation expense. 
 Refer to Note 21, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion about the assumptions related to these awards and the impact on our results for 2022 and 2021.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure from variable interest rates, primarily related to our 2021 Debt Agreement and 2022 RSA. These variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. We primarily manage interest rate exposure through a mix of variable rate debt (weighted average rate of 5.2 as of December 31, 2022) and fixed rate equipment lease financing. Assuming the level of borrowings as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by 14.4 million. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We have commodity exposure with respect to fuel used in company-owned tractors. Increases in fuel prices would continue to raise our operating costs, even after applying fuel surcharge revenue. Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges. The weekly average diesel price per gallon in the US increased to an average of 5.01 per gallon for 2022 from an average of 3.29 per gallon for 2021. We cannot predict the extent or speed of potential changes in fuel price levels in the future, the degree to which the lag effect of our fuel surcharge programs will impact us as a result of the timing and magnitude of such changes, or the extent to which effective fuel surcharges can be maintained and collected to offset such increases. We generally have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our fuel price exposure in the past, but continue to evaluate this possibility.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. 
 Opinion on the financial statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. 
 Basis for opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical audit matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Swift auto liability claims accrual 
 As described in footnote 12 to the financial statements, the Company is self-insured for a portion of its risk related to auto liability claims. The Company accrues for the cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims by evaluating the nature and severity of individual claims and by estimating future claims development based upon historical development trends. The actual cost to settle self-insured claim liabilities may differ from the Company s reserve estimates due to legal costs, claims that have been incurred but not reported, and various other uncertainties, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of the claims and the potential judgment or settlement amount to dispose of the claim. 
 We identified the estimation of Swift s auto liability claims accrual, which is subject to certain self-insured retention limits, as a critical audit matter. Auto liability unpaid claim liabilities are determined by projecting the estimated ultimate loss related to a claim, less actual costs paid to date. These estimates rely on the assumption that historical claim patterns are an accurate representation for future claims that have been incurred but not completely paid. The 
 69 

principal considerations for assessing the auto liability claims accrual as a critical audit matter is the high level of estimation uncertainty related to determining the severity of these types of claims, as well as the inherent subjectivity in management s judgment in estimating the total costs to settle or dispose of these claims. 
 Our audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over auto liability claims, including the completeness and accuracy of claim expenses and payments and management s review over actuarial calculations. 
 We tested management s process for determining the auto liability claims accrual, including evaluating the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions used in estimating the ultimate claim losses with the assistance of an actuarial specialist. 
 We tested the claims data used in the actuarial calculation by selecting samples of historical claims data and inspecting source documents to test key attributes of the claims data.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2011.

 Management believes that these methods properly spread the costs over the useful lives of the assets. Management judgment is involved when determining estimated useful lives of the Company's long-lived assets. Useful lives of the Company's long-lived assets are determined based on historical experience, as well as future expectations regarding the period the Company expects to benefit from the asset. Factors affecting estimated useful lives of property and equipment may include estimating loss, damage, obsolescence, and Company policies around maintenance and asset replacement. 
 Management evaluates its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment . When such events or changes in circumstances occur, management performs a recoverability test that compares the carrying amount with the projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. An impairment is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, when necessary. Estimating fair value includes several significant assumptions, including future cash flow estimates, determination of appropriate discount rates, and other assumptions that management believes reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment.

 years to years. Certain trade names have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually, unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value. 
 Management reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, management performs a recoverability test that compares the carrying amount with the projected discounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. An impairment is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, which is generally determined using discounted future cash flows. 
 Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals. Estimating fair value includes several significant assumptions, including future cash flow estimates, determination of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates, and other assumptions that management believes reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment.

 reportable segments (Truckload, LTL, Logistics, and Intermodal). 
 Step 1: Contract Identification Management has identified that a legally enforceable contract with its customers is executed by both parties at the point of pickup at the shipper's location, as evidenced by the bill of lading. Although the Company may have master agreements with its customers, these master agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation to the shipper until the load is tendered/accepted and the Company takes possession of the load. 
 Step 2: Performance Obligations The Company's only performance obligation is transportation services. The Company's delivery, accessorial, and dedicated operations truck capacity in its dedicated operations represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another. For example, the Company generally would not provide accessorial services or truck capacity without providing delivery services. 
 Step 3: Transaction Price Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel surcharge revenue, accessorial fees, truck capacity, and/or non-cash consideration. Non-cash consideration is measured by the estimated fair value of the non-cash consideration at contract inception. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the Company's customers generally pay within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 60 days. 
 Step 4: Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations The transaction price is entirely allocated to the only performance obligation: transportation services. 
 Step 5: Revenue Recognition The performance obligation of providing transportation services is satisfied over time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized over time. Management estimates the amount of revenue in transit at period end based on the number of days completed of the dispatch (which is generally one to three days for the Truckload, LTL, and Logistics segments, but can be longer for intermodal operations). Management believes this to be a faithful depiction of the transfer of services because if a load is dispatched, but terminates mid-route and the load is picked up by another carrier, then that carrier would not need to re-perform the services for the days already traveled. 
 The Company outsources the transportation of loads to third-party carriers through its logistics operations. Management has determined that the Company is a principal in these arrangements, and therefore records revenue associated with these contracts on a gross basis. The Company has the primary responsibility to meet the customers' requirements. The Company invoices and collects from its customers and maintains discretion over pricing. Additionally, the Company is responsible for the selection of third-party transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements. 
 Significant judgments involved in the Company's revenue recognition and corresponding accounts receivable balances include: 
 Measuring in-transit revenue at period end (discussed above). 
 Estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability. Management reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. Uncollectible accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible, and accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. 
 Contract Balances In-transit revenue balances are included in "Contract balance revenue in transit" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's contract liability balances are typically immaterial. 
 Revenue Disaggregation In considering the level at which the Company should disaggregate revenues pertaining to contracts with customers, management determined that there are no significant differences between segments in how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue or cash flows are affected by economic factors. Additionally, management considered how and where the Company has communicated information about revenue for various purposes, including disclosures outside of the financial statements and how information is regularly reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision makers for evaluating financial

 likely to be realized. The Company records expected incurred interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in "Income tax expense" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. 
 Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Management periodically assesses the likelihood that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Management judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors including the appropriateness of tax strategies. The Company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall income taxes. It is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed, resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs, in the event that tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities. An ultimate result worse than the Company's expectations could adversely affect its results of operations.

 Pursuant to the 2021 Debt Agreement, the 2021 Revolver and the 2021 Term Loans contain certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The 2021 Debt Agreement provides flexibility regarding the use of proceeds from asset sales, payment of dividends, stock repurchases, and equipment financing. In addition to the financial covenants, the 2021 Debt Agreement includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the 2021 Debt Agreement may be accelerated, and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. The 2021 Debt Agreement contains certain usual and customary restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, dividends (which are restricted only if a default or event of default occurs and is continuing or would result therefrom), liens, affiliate transactions, and other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2021 Debt Agreement. 
 Borrowings under the 2021 Debt Agreement, are made by Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc., and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's material domestic subsidiaries (other than its captive insurance subsidiaries, driving academy subsidiary, and bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary). 
 July 2021 Term Loan On July 6, 2021, Knight-Swift entered into a billion term loan with Bank of America, N.A (the "July 2021 Term Loan"). The July 2021 Term Loan was incremental to, and was separate from, the 2017 Debt Agreement. The July 2021 Term Loan was fully funded on July 6, 2021 and there were no scheduled principal payments prior to its scheduled maturity in October 2022. The interest rate applicable to the July 2021 Term Loan was subject to a leverage-based grid and equaled the rate plus at closing. The July 2021 Term Loan was paid off and terminated using the proceeds of the 2021 Term Loans, discussed above. 
 The July 2021 Term Loan contained similar terms to the 2017 Debt Agreement, including the financial covenants, usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature, and certain usual and customary restrictions and covenants.

 The Company leases revenue equipment to independent contractors and other third parties under operating leases, which generally have terms between three and four years, and include renewal and purchase options. These leases also include variable charges associated with miles driven in excess of the stipulated allowable miles in the contract, which are accounted for separately and presented in the table below. Lease classification is determined based on minimum rental receipts per the agreement, including residual value guarantees, when applicable, as well as receivables due to the Company upon default or cross-default. When independent contractors default on their leases, the Company typically re-leases the equipment to other independent contractors. As such, future lease receipts reflect original leases and re-leases. 
 The Company's leases to third parties, some of which are subleases, are generally short-term, and may include renewal options. 
 The owned assets underlying the Company's leases as lessor primarily consist of revenue equipment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the gross carrying value of such revenue equipment underlying these leases was million and million, respectively, and accumulated depreciation was million and million, respectively. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis down to the residual value, as applicable, over the estimated useful life of the equipment. Depreciation expense for these assets was million and million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Additionally, the Company periodically leases or subleases out real estate for use by third parties. These leases have varying terms, and may include renewal options. 
 Management s significant assumptions and judgments include the determination of the amount the Company expects to derive from the underlying asset at the end of the lease term, as well as whether a contract contains a lease.

 ACT's assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets are based on a periodic review of the plan s asset allocation over a long-term period. Expectations of returns for each asset class are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data and economic/financial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (1) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and (2) projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants.

 The investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefit payments. The investment guidelines consider a broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation percentages (shown above) by major asset categories. The objectives of the target allocation percentages are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters and achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plan s actuarial assumptions.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no significant change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Company; and 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on this assessment, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that also audited the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Grant Thornton LLP's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting is included herein.

 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Equity Plan Information 
 Before the 2017 Merger, Knight and Swift granted stock-based awards under their respective stock-based compensation plans, discussed below. 
 2014 Stock Plan Currently, the 2014 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, is the Company s only compensatory stock-based incentive plan. The previous 2014 stock plan replaced Swift's 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan when it was adopted by Swift's board of directors in March 2014 and then approved by the Swift stockholders in May 2014. The previous 2014 stock plan was amended and restated to rename the plan and for other administrative changes relating to the 2017 Merger. The 2014 Stock Plan was again amended and restated in 2020 to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance and extended the term of the 2014 Stock Plan, as well as to amend certain provisions to comply with best practices. Other terms of the 2014 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, remain substantially the same as the previous 2014 stock plan and first amended and restated stock plan. The 2014 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits the payment of cash incentive compensation and authorizes the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units, cash-based awards, and stock-based awards to the Company's employees and non-employee directors. 
 2012 ESPP The 2012 ESPP, as amended, authorized the Company to issue shares of its common stock to eligible employees who participate in the plan.

 (g) Each Related Committed Purchaser s and related LC Participant s obligations hereunder shall be several, such that the failure of any Related Committed Purchaser or related LC Participant to make any Purchase hereunder or a payment in connection with a drawing under a Letter of Credit hereunder, as the case may be, shall not relieve any other Related Committed 
 Purchaser or related LC Participant of its obligation hereunder to make payment for any Funded 
 Purchase or such drawing. Further, in the event any Related Committed Purchaser or related LC Participant fails to satisfy its obligation to make a Purchase or payment with respect to such drawing as required hereunder, upon receipt of notice of such failure from the Administrator (or any relevant Purchaser Agent), subject to the limitations set forth herein, (i) (A) the non-defaulting Related Committed Purchasers in such defaulting Related Committed Purchaser s Purchaser

 Percentages (determined without regard to the Commitment Percentage of the defaulting Related Committed Purchaser)) or (B) the non-defaulting related LC Participants in such defaulting related LC Participant s Purchaser Group shall fund the defaulting related LC Participant s Pro Rata Share of the related drawing (based on their relative Pro Rata Shares (determined without regard to the Pro Rata Share of the defaulting related LC Participant)) and (ii) if there are no other (A) Related Committed Purchasers in such Purchaser Group or if such other Related Committed Purchasers are also defaulting Related Committed Purchasers, then such defaulting Related Committed Purchaser s Commitment Percentage of its Purchaser Group s Ratable Share of such Purchase shall be funded by each other Purchaser Group ratably (based on their relative Purchaser Group Ratable Shares) and applied in accordance with this paragraph (g) or (B) if there are no other related LC Participants in such Purchaser Group or if such other related LC 
 -5- 

Participants are also defaulting related LC Participants, then such defaulting related LC Participant s Pro Rata Share of such drawing shall be funded by each other Purchaser Group ratably (based on their relative Pro Rata Shares) and applied in accordance with this paragraph (g) . Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (g) to the contrary, no Related Committed Purchaser or related LC Participant shall be required to make a Purchase or payment with respect to such drawing pursuant to this paragraph (g) for an amount which would cause the aggregate Capital of such Related Committed Purchaser or Pro Rata Share of the face amount of any outstanding Letter of Credit of such related LC Participant (after giving effect to such Purchase or payment with respect to such drawing) to exceed its Commitment. 
 Section 1.3 Purchased Interest Computation . The Purchased Interest shall be initially computed on the date of the initial Purchase hereunder.
