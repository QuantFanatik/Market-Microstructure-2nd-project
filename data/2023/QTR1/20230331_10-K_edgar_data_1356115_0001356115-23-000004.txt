 Primary Investment Objective 
 
 As a diversified REIT, the Company s primary investment objective is to provide both current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve this objective through its focus on investing across the capital structure in various commercial real estate property types. Target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, SFR, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. The Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities.

Table of Contents 

 The Company focuses on opportunistic investments in real estate properties with a value-add component and real estate credit with the objective to increase the cash flow and value of our properties, acquire properties with cash flow growth potential and achieve capital appreciation for shareholders through a value-add program. The Company pursues real estate credit investments based on where the Adviser believes the various real estate subsectors are performing within the broader real estate cycle and tactically allocates its investments among these opportunities. 
 
 The Company believes that a diversified investment approach is appropriate for the current market environment. However, to capitalize on investment opportunities at different times in the economic and real estate investment cycle, the Company may change its investment strategy from time to time. The Company believes that the flexibility of the Company's investment strategy and the experience and resources of the Adviser and its affiliates will allow the Company to take advantage of changing market conditions to provide both current income and generate capital appreciation. The Board is able to modify the Company's strategies to the extent it determines it is in Company's best interest. 
 
 Target Investments 
 
 We invest primarily in commercial real estate, including operating properties and common equity but also including, but not limited to, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity: 
 
 Operating Properties: We make investments in operating properties with a value-add component, including but not limited to retail, hospitality, and office space rented from the Company and land for development. 
 
 Common Equity: We make investments in common equity in publicly traded companies and privately held entities focused on investment in real estate across a range of underlying property types. 
 
 Mortgage Debt: We expect that we may make investments in mortgage debt on real estate properties. The loans may vary in duration, bear interest at a fixed or floating rate and amortize, typically with a balloon payment of principal at maturity. These investments may include whole loans or pari passu participations within such mortgage debt. 
 
 Mezzanine Loans: We expect that we may originate or acquire mezzanine loans. These loans are generally subordinate to the other mortgage debt on a property, but senior to the equity of the borrower. These loans are not secured by the underlying real estate, but generally can be converted into preferred equity of the mortgage borrower or owner of a mortgage borrower, as applicable. 
 
 Preferred Equity: We expect that we may make investments that are subordinate to any mortgage or mezzanine loan, but senior to the common equity of the borrower. Preferred equity investments typically receive a preferred return from the issuer s cash flow rather than interest payments and often have the right for such preferred return to accrue if there is insufficient cash flow for current payment. These investments are not secured by the underlying real estate, but upon the occurrence of a default, the preferred equity provider typically has the right to effect a change of control with respect to the ownership of the property. 
 
 In addition to investments in real estate, the Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities. The Company s non-real estate investments include its ownership of common equity, preferred equity, loans, CLOs, rights and warrants, U.S. life settlement contracts, convertible notes and bonds from a number of diverse issuers and investment vehicles, including litigation claims and midband spectrum frequency licenses. 
 
 Our Financing Strategy 
 
 While we do not have any formal restrictions or policy with respect to our debt-to-equity leverage ratio, we currently expect that our leverage will not exceed a ratio of 3-to-l. We believe this leverage ratio is prudent given that leverage typically exists at the asset level. The amount of leverage we may employ for particular assets depends upon the availability of particular types of financing and our Adviser s assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets and financing counterparties. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets is at the discretion of our Adviser, subject to review by our Board, and is not subject to the approval of our shareholders. We generally intend to match leverage term and structure to that of the underlying investment financed. For additional information on sources of and trends regarding our liquidity, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources.

(1) The Portfolio may be held directly or through one or more intermediate entities. 
 
 Our Adviser 
 
 The Company is externally managed by the Adviser, through an agreement dated July 1, 2022, amended on October 25, 2022 (the Advisory Agreement ), by and among the Company and the Adviser for an initial three-year term that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. The Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of the Company and provides investment management services. All of the Company s investment decisions are made by the Adviser, subject to general oversight by the Adviser s investment committee and the Company s Board. The Adviser is wholly owned by our Sponsor. The members of our Adviser s investment committee are James Dondero, Matt McGraner, Matthew Goetz, and Brian Mitts. 
 
 Our Advisory Agreement 
 
 We pay our Adviser annual fees. We do not pay any incentive fees to our Adviser. We also generally reimburse our Adviser for operating or offering expenses it incurs on our behalf or in connection with the services it performs for us.

Table of Contents 

 Direct payment of operating expenses by us together with reimbursement of operating expenses to the Adviser, plus compensation expenses relating to equity awards granted under a long-term incentive plan and all other corporate general and administrative expenses of the Company, including the Fees (defined below) payable under the Advisory Agreement, may not exceed 1.5 (the Expense Cap of Managed Assets (defined below), calculated as of the end of each quarter, for the twelve-month period following the Company s receipt of the Deregistration Order; provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses (defined below), legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions or other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate-related investments; provided, further, in the event the Company consolidates another entity that it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such entity or otherwise, expenses will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such entity s expenses will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of expenses. The Adviser may, at its discretion and at any time, waive its right to reimbursement for eligible out-of-pocket expenses paid on the Company s behalf. Once waived, these expenses are considered permanently waived and become non-recoupable in the future. 
 
 Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser will, among other things: 
 
 identify, evaluate and negotiate the structure of our investments (including performing due diligence); 
 
 find, present and recommend investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives; 
 
 structure the terms and conditions of our investments; 
 
 review and analyze financial information for each investment in our overall Portfolio; 
 
 close, monitor and administer our investments; and 
 
 identify debt and equity capital needs and procure the necessary capital. 
 
 As consideration for the Adviser s services under the Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser an annual fee (the Advisory Fee of 1.00 of Managed Assets and an annual fee (the Administrative Fee and, together with the Advisory Fee, the Fees of 0.20 of the Company s Managed Assets. The Advisory Agreement provides that the first portion of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee shall be paid in cash up to 1.0 million and the remainder of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee, if any, shall be paid in common shares of the Company, subject to certain restrictions related to maintaining the Company s status as a REIT and compliance with federal securities laws and rules promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ). In addition, in no event will the common shares issued to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement exceed five percent of the number of common shares or five percent of the voting power of the Company outstanding prior to the first such issuance. The number of common shares payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement as a portion of the Advisory Fee shall equal (i) the total dollar amount of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee payable minus the 1.0 million cash portion of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee divided by (ii) the volume-weighted average price per share for the 10 trading days prior to the end of the month for which the Fees will be paid. The Fees shall be payable independent of the performance of the Company or its investments. The Advisory Agreement also provides that the Administrative Fee shall be paid in cash. 
 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, Managed Assets means an amount equal to the total assets of the Company, including any form of leverage, minus all accrued expenses incurred in the normal course of operations, but not excluding any liabilities or obligations attributable to leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation, borrowing to purchase or develop real estate or other investments, borrowing through a credit facility, or the issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred shares or other preference securities, (iii) the reinvestment of collateral received for securities loaned in accordance with the Company s investment objectives and policies, and/or (iv) any other means. In the event the Company holds collateralized mortgage-backed securities CMBS where the Company holds the controlling tranche of the securitization and is required to consolidate under generally accepted accounting principles all assets and liabilities of a specific CMBS trust, the consolidated assets and liabilities of the consolidated trust will be netted to calculate the allowable amount to be included as Managed Assets. In addition, in the event the Company consolidates another person it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such person or otherwise, Managed Assets will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such person s assets, leverage, expenses, liabilities and obligations will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of Managed Assets. The Adviser computes Managed Assets as of the end of each fiscal quarter and then computes each installment of the Fees as promptly as possible after the end of the month with respect to which such installment is payable.

 Incentive compensation may be payable to our executive officers and certain other employees of our Adviser or its affiliates pursuant to a long-term incentive plan adopted by us and approved by our shareholders. Compensation expense is generally not considered when calculating Managed Assets. 
 
 We are required to pay directly or reimburse the Adviser for all of the documented operating expenses (all out-of-pocket expenses of the Adviser in performing services for us, including but not limited to the expenses incurred by the Adviser in connection with any provision by the Adviser of legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, investor relations or other services performed by the Adviser that outside professionals or outside consultants would otherwise perform and our pro rata share of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery or other office, internal and overhead expenses of the Adviser required for our operations) and any and all expenses (other than underwriters discounts) paid or to be paid by us in connection with an offering of our securities, including, without limitation, our legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees and other documented offering expenses (collectively, Offering Expenses ), paid or incurred by the Adviser or its affiliates in connection with the services it provides to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Direct payment of operating expenses by us together with reimbursement of operating expenses to the Adviser, plus compensation expenses relating to equity awards granted under a long-term incentive plan and all other corporate general and administrative expenses of the Company, including the Fees payable under the Advisory Agreement, may not exceed the Expense Cap of 1.5 of Managed Assets, calculated as of the end of each quarter, for the twelve-month period following the Company s receipt of the Deregistration Order; provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions or other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate-related investments; provided, further, in the event the Company consolidates another entity that it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such entity or otherwise, expenses will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such entity s expenses will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of expenses. The Adviser may, at its discretion and at any time, waive its right to reimbursement for eligible out-of-pocket expenses paid on the Company s behalf. Once waived, these expenses are considered permanently waived and become non-recoupable in the future. 
 
 The Advisory Agreement has an initial term of three years that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive additional one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. We have the right to terminate the Advisory Agreement on 30 days written notice upon the occurrence of a cause event (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). The Advisory Agreement can be terminated by us or the Adviser without cause upon the expiration of the then-current term with at least 180 days written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of such term. The Adviser may also terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice if we have materially breached the agreement and such breach has continued for 30 days before we are given such notice. In addition, the Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of Advisers Act Assignment (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) unless we provide written consent. A termination fee will be payable to the Adviser by us upon termination of the Advisory Agreement for any reason, including non-renewal, other than a termination by us upon the occurrence of a cause event or due to an Advisers Act Assignment. The termination fee will be equal to three times the Fees earned by the Adviser during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the effective termination date; provided, however, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated prior to the one year anniversary of the date of the Advisory Agreement, the Fees earned during such period will be annualized for purposes of calculating the Fees. 
 
 Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries, including the OP, from all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that are incurred by reason of the Adviser s bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties; provided, however, that the Adviser will not be held responsible for any action of our Board in following or declining to follow any written advice or written recommendation given by the Adviser. However, the aggregate maximum amount that the Adviser may be liable to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement will, to the extent not prohibited by law, never exceed the amount of the Advisory Fees received by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement prior to the date that the acts or omissions giving rise to a claim for indemnification or liability have occurred. In addition, the Adviser will not be liable for special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, or consequential loss, or damage of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation lost profits. The limitations described in the preceding two sentences will not apply, however, to the extent such damages are determined in a final binding non-appealable court or arbitration proceeding to result from the bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the Adviser s duties. 
 
 The Adviser and its affiliates expect to engage in other business ventures, and as a result, their resources will not be dedicated exclusively to our business. However, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is required to devote sufficient resources to our administration to discharge its obligations under the Advisory Agreement.

Management of Operating Properties 
 
 The Company s operating properties, other than undeveloped land, are managed by NexVest Realty Advisors, LLC NexVest ), an affiliate of the Adviser. The property management agreement with NexVest for the retail property in Lubbock, Texas is dated January 1, 2014 and has a fixed fee of 750 per month. The property management agreement with NexVest for Cityplace Tower is dated August 15, 2018, and the management fee is calculated on 3 of gross revenues, with a minimum fee of 20,000 per month. The property management agreement with NexVest for the White Rock Center is dated June 1, 2013, and the management fee is calculated on 4 of gross receipts, payable monthly. 
 
 Management of Life Settlement Contracts 
 
 The Company s investments in U.S. life settlement contracts through SFP, a wholly owned Irish Designated Activity Company, are managed by NexAnnuity Asset Management, L.P. NexAnnuity ), an affiliate of the Adviser. SFP acquires life settlement contracts funded by the issuance of debt securities (the Structured Note purchased by the Company and utilizes proceeds from maturing life settlement contracts to repay the Structured Note and to further invest in life settlement contracts. The management agreement (the SFP IMA with NexAnnuity provides that NexAnnuity will receive a management fee (the SFP Management Fee paid monthly in an amount equal to 1.0 of the average weekly value of an amount equal to the total assets of SFP, including any form of leverage, minus all accrued expenses incurred in the normal course of operations, but not excluding any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation, borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other preference securities, (iii) the reinvestment of collateral received for securities loaned in accordance with the investment objective, investment guidelines and policies under the SFP IMA, and/or (iv) any other means, plus any value added tax or any other applicable tax, if any, thereon. NexAnnuity may waive all or a portion of the SFP Management Fee. For the year ended December 31, 2022, NexAnnuity did not waive any portion of the SFP Management Fee. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire investments in commercial real estate at attractive prices. We are subject to significant competition in acquiring these investments. In particular, we will compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, mortgage bankers, commercial finance and insurance companies, governmental bodies and other financial institutions, as well as developers, owners, and operators of real estate. We may also compete with our Sponsor and its affiliates for investment opportunities. There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns. In addition, there are several REITs with similar investment objectives and others may be organized in the future. These other REITs will increase competition for the available supply of commercial real estate investments, including operating properties, common equity mortgage debt, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and other real estate related assets suitable for investment. Some of our anticipated competitors have greater financial resources, different cost structures, access to lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to us, such as funding from the U.S. government, if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the U.S. government. In addition, some of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion or exemption from the Investment Company Act. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, or pay higher prices, than we can. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for our investments. An increase in the competition for such assets may decrease the availability or increase the price of such assets, which may limit our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted current income and capital appreciation for our shareholders, thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common shares. 
 
 In addition, with respect to our operating properties, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, flexibility, and expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained, and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-lease space in light of the large number of competing properties within the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below-market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space. 
 
 In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to our Sponsor s professionals and their industry experience, which we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments. We expect that these relationships will enable us to compete more efficiently and effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Although we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the extensive 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 competition in our market sector. We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and future competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in commercial real estate and could also affect the pricing of our securities. 
 
 Operating and Regulatory Structure 
 
 General 
 
 Our operating properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to fire and safety requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants and, in some instances, common area obligations. We believe that each of the operating properties in our Portfolio has the necessary permits and approvals. 
 
 Americans with Disabilities Act 
 
 Our operating properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the ADA ), to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our operating properties where such removal is readily achievable. In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals. The readily achievable standard considers, among other factors, the financial resources of the affected site and the owner, lessor or other applicable person. 
 
 Compliance with the ADA, as well as other federal, state and local laws, may require modifications to operating properties we currently own or may purchase or may restrict renovations of those properties. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional obligations or restrictions on our operating properties. We could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with these laws or regulations. 
 
 We believe that our operating properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA will not be required. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our operating properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under, or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our operating properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our operating properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our operating properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. 
 
 Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments at all of our operating properties, including undeveloped land, in our Portfolio. A Phase I environmental site assessment is a report that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the assessed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the site assessments identified any known past or present contamination that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or operations. However, the assessments are limited in scope and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our operating properties, or operations and conditions at nearby properties, may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. Moreover, conditions identified in environmental assessments that did not appear material at that time, may in the future result in material liability. 
 
 Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of hazardous materials in building materials (e.g., asbestos and lead), and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability (e.g., liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing hazardous materials properly manage and maintain certain hazardous materials, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with certain hazardous materials, and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if certain hazardous materials would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. In addition, the operating properties in our Portfolio are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements. 
 
 When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our operating properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our operating properties. 
 
 Generally, the leases with respect to our office and retail operating properties require the lessee to comply with environmental law and provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the lessee s violation of environmental law or the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our operating property attributable to the lessee. If our lessees do not comply with environmental law, or we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees, our results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 
 We believe that there are no compliance issues with laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have adversely affected, or are reasonably expected to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures arising from environmental regulation. We believe that climate change could present risks to our business. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements and the risk of disruptions to our business. We do not believe these risks are material to our business at this time. Our currently anticipated capital expenditures for environmental control facility matters are not material. 
 
 The cost of future environmental compliance may materially and adversely affect us. We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on our properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. If we or our tenants were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to certain risks associated with investing in real estate, including potential liabilities under environmental laws and risks of loss from weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, climate change and terrorism. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on the operating properties in our Portfolio, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement-cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. Our property policies include coverage for the perils of flood, tornado and earthquake shock with limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the project. We will also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to the properties in our Portfolio. We have obtained coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. These policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from environmental conditions, acts of war or certain kinds of terrorist attacks) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise

 against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. In addition, for the operating properties in our Portfolio, we could self-insure certain portions of our insurance program and therefore, use our own funds to satisfy those limits. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. In the opinion of our management team, the operating properties in our Portfolio are adequately insured. 
 
 REIT Qualification 
 
 We have to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we will qualify and remain qualified as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property or REIT prohibited transactions taxes with respect to certain of our activities. Any distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferred U.S. federal income tax rates that apply to certain distributions received by individuals from taxable corporations. 
 
 Investment Company Act Exclusion 
 
 We, as well as our subsidiaries, intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of the issuer s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40 test. Excluded from the term investment securities, among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 
 
 We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our OP and through subsidiaries of our OP. We anticipate that our OP will always be at least a majority-owned subsidiary. We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor our OP will hold investment securities in excess of the limit imposed by the 40 test. The securities issued by any wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we may form in the future that are excluded from the definition of investment company based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40 of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe that neither we nor our OP are considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because neither of us engage primarily, propose to engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we and our OP are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of our subsidiaries. 
 
 We anticipate that certain of our subsidiaries will meet the requirements of the exclusion set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. To meet this exclusion, the SEC staff has taken the position that at least 55 of a subsidiary s assets must constitute qualifying assets (as interpreted by the SEC staff under the Investment Company Act) and at least another 25 of assets (subject to reduction to the extent the subsidiary invested more than 55 of its total assets in qualifying assets) must constitute real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act (and no more than 20 comprised of miscellaneous assets). In general, we also expect, with regard to our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C), to rely on other guidance published by the SEC staff and on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying assets and real estate-related assets. Maintaining the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, however, will limit our ability to make certain investments.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
 
 Our real estate investments are subject to risks particular to real property. These risks may result in a reduction or elimination of or return from an investment secured by a particular property. 
 
 Real estate investments are subject to various risks, including: 
 
 acts of nature, including extreme weather, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, as result of climate change or otherwise, which may result in uninsured losses; 
 
 acts of war, terrorism, social unrest or civil disturbances, including the consequences of such acts; 
 
 adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions; 
 
 changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations and ordinances; 
 
 costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions including, but not limited to, indoor mold; and 
 
 the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses. 
 
 If any of these or similar events occurs, it may reduce our return from an affected property or investment and reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. 
 
 Because we primarily invest in the real estate industry, our investments expose us to risks similar to and associated with real estate investments generally. 
 
 Our investments are primarily in or relating to real estate-related businesses, assets or interests, including but not limited to real property, common equity, debt and preferred equity. Any deterioration of real estate fundamentals generally, 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 and in the United States in particular, could negatively impact our performance by making it more difficult for entities in which we have an investment requiring periodic payments or a return of capital, or borrower entities, to satisfy their payment obligations, increasing the default risk applicable to these entities, and/or making it relatively more difficult for us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Any such deterioration may also make it more difficult for entities in which we have an investment without a specific payment obligation to make distributions or returns of capital to us. Changes in general economic conditions will affect the creditworthiness of borrower entities or other investees and may include economic and/or market fluctuations, changes in environmental, zoning and other laws, casualty or condemnation losses, regulatory limitations on rents, variations in rental income, decreases in property values, changes in the appeal of properties to tenants, changes in supply and demand, fluctuations in real estate fundamentals, energy supply shortages, various uninsured or uninsurable risks, natural disasters, pandemics, changes in government regulations (such as rent control), changes in real property tax rates and operating expenses, changes in interest rates, changes in the availability of debt financing and/or mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable, increased mortgage defaults, increases in borrowing rates, negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity, demand and/or real estate values generally and other factors that are beyond our control. The value of securities of companies that service the real estate business sector may also be affected by such risks. 
 
 We cannot predict the degree to which economic conditions generally, and the conditions for loans and investments in real estate, will improve or deteriorate. Declines in the performance of the U.S. and global economies or in the real estate debt markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. In addition, market conditions relating to real estate debt and preferred equity investments have evolved since the global financial crisis, which has resulted in a modification to certain structures and/or market terms. Any such changes in structures and/or market terms may make it relatively more difficult for us to monitor and evaluate our loans and investments. 
 
 Commercial real estate-related investments that are secured, directly or indirectly, by real property are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us. 
 
 Commercial real estate investments, including investments in debt secured by commercial property, are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with investments in or loans made on the security of single-family residential property. Our ability to realize a return on our investments in commercial real estate typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of the property or properties. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, our ability to realize a return on our investment may be impaired. Net operating income of an income-producing property can be affected by, among other things: 
 
 tenant mix and tenant bankruptcies; 
 
 success of tenant businesses; 
 
 property management decisions, including with respect to capital improvements, particularly in older building structures; 
 
 property location and condition; 
 
 competition from other properties offering the same or similar services; 
 
 changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; 
 
 any need to address environmental contamination at the property; 
 
 changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments; 
 
 declines in regional or local real estate values; 
 
 declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; 
 
 changes in interest rates and in the state of the debt and equity capital markets, including diminished availability or lack of debt financing for commercial real estate; 
 
 changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; 
 
 changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation; 
 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, social unrest and civil disturbances, which may decrease the availability of or increase the cost of insurance or result in uninsured losses; and 
 
 adverse changes in zoning laws. 
 
 In addition, we are exposed to the risk of judicial proceedings with our borrowers and entities we invest in, including bankruptcy or other litigation, as a strategy to avoid foreclosure or enforcement of other rights by us as a lender or investor. In the event that any of the properties or entities underlying or collateralizing our loans or investments experiences any of the foregoing events or occurrences, the value of, and return on, such investments, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Most of real estate investments are dependent upon our tenants successfully operating their businesses, and their failure to do so could adversely affect us. 
 
 Most of our properties are occupied by tenants. Therefore, the success of our investments in these properties is materially dependent upon the performance of our tenants. The financial performance of any one of our tenants is dependent on the tenant s individual business, its industry and, in some instances, may also be dependent on the performance of a larger business network that the tenant may be affiliated with or operate under. The financial performance of any one of our tenants could be adversely affected by poor management, unfavorable economic conditions in general, changes in consumer trends and preferences that decrease demand for a tenant s products or services or other factors, including the impact of a global pandemic which affects the United States, over which neither they nor we have control. Our Portfolio may include properties leased to tenants that operate in multiple locations, and in the future we may own multiple properties operated by the same tenant. 
 
 At any given time, any tenant may experience a decline in its business that may weaken its operating results or the overall financial condition of individual properties or its business as a whole. Any such decline may result in our tenant failing to make rental payments when due, declining to extend a lease upon its expiration, delaying occupancy of our property or the commencement of the lease or becoming insolvent or declaring bankruptcy. We depend on our tenants to operate their businesses at the properties we own or in which we own interests in a manner which generates revenues sufficient to allow them to meet their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent and, if agreed by the tenant, their obligations to maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate taxes, make repairs and otherwise maintain our properties. The ability of tenants to fulfill their obligations under leases may depend, in part, upon the overall profitability of their operations. Cash flow generated by certain tenant businesses may not be sufficient for a tenant to meet its obligations pursuant to the applicable lease. 
 
 Many of our operating costs and expenses associated with our investments are or may be fixed and will not decline if revenues decline. 
 
 Our results of operations or the results of operations of underlying property owners for our investments depend, in large part, on the level of revenues, operating costs, and expenses. The operating costs or expenses associated with ownership of a property by us or underlying property owners for our investments is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenue from the property. As a result, if revenues decline, we or the underlying property owners for our investments may not be able to reduce operating costs or expenses to keep pace with the corresponding reductions in revenues. Many of the costs and expenses associated with our investments, such as taxes, insurance, loan payments, and maintenance generally will or may not be reduced if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause revenues to decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, and ability to service our debt obligations. 
 
 We are subject to certain risks associated with investing in real estate, including potential liabilities under environmental laws and risks of loss from weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, climate change and terrorism. 
 
 Under various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender that succeeds to ownership or control of a property) may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, under or in its property. Those laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The owner or control party of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injuries associated with asbestos-containing materials. 
 
 Weather conditions and man-made or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires and other environmental conditions can damage properties we own. Future weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, effects of climate change or acts of terrorism could adversely impact the demand for, and value of, our assets and could also directly impact the value of our assets through damage, destruction or loss, and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against these events. Although we believe our owned real estate and real estate we have investments in are adequately covered by insurance, we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future, or if we will be able to continue to pass along all of the costs of insurance to our tenants. Any weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, terrorist attack or effect of climate change, whether or not insured, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, liquidity and the market price of our shares. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our property insurers may not be able to fulfill their obligations with respect to claims payments due to a deterioration in its financial condition. 
 
 Investments in securities of other companies or issuers, including debt and equity instruments such as bonds, preferred or common stock, or convertible instruments, could cause us to incur losses or other expenses which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 We currently own and may own in the future, investments in securities of companies or issuers including debt and equity instruments, which may include bonds, preferred or common stock, or convertible instruments. Certain of these investments may be traded on an exchange or other active market while other investments may not be actively traded and without a readily observable market price. With respect to investments traded on an exchange or other active market, the price of the underlying instrument may be quoted such that the market value of the instrument varies during a given trading day, or the price may be quoted less frequently. Adverse fluctuations in the value of these investments, whether market-generated or not, may be reflected as unrealized losses on our balance sheet depending on the type of investment and our accounting methodologies. We may choose to or be required to liquidate these investments in whole or in part and at prices that result in realized losses on our investment. Should we incur realized losses on liquidating these investments, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Our investments in the securities of companies or issuers which are engaged in the real estate industry are also subject to risks associated with the investment in real estate generally. 
 
 Our investments in non-real estate businesses, though expected to be limited, may expose us to risks from a number of diverse issuers, industries and investment forms. 
 
 Though our investments are primarily in or relating to real estate-related businesses, assets or interests, we may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities, including securities or investments held by us prior to our receipt of the Deregistration Order under the Investment Company Act on July 1, 2022. As a result, to the extent we hold, acquire or transact in non-real estate securities or investments, we may be exposed to risks from a number of diverse industries, issuers and investment forms, which may cause an investment in us to increase or decrease in value differently than may otherwise be expected if we solely invested in real estate businesses. 
 
 Fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads could reduce our ability to generate income on our loans and other investments, which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments. 
 
 Our primary interest rate exposures relate to the yield on our loans and other investments and the financing cost of our debt, as well as interest rate swaps that we may utilize for hedging purposes. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads may affect our net income from loans and other investments, which is the difference between the interest and related income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest and related expense we incur in financing these investments. Interest rate and credit spread fluctuations resulting in our interest and related expense exceeding interest and related income would result in operating losses for us. Changes in the level of interest rates and credit spreads also may affect our ability to make loans or investments, the value of our loans and investments and our ability to realize gains from the disposition of assets. Increases in interest rates and credit spreads may also negatively affect demand for loans and could result in higher borrower default rates. 
 
 Our operating results depend, in part, on differences between the income earned on our investments, net of credit losses, and our financing costs. The yields we earn on our floating-rate assets and our borrowing costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates. However, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. In addition, we could experience reductions in the yield on our investments and an increase in the cost of our financing. Although we seek to match the terms of our liabilities to the expected lives of loans that we acquire or originate, circumstances may arise in which our liabilities are shorter in duration than our assets, 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 resulting in their adjusting faster in response to changes in interest rates. For any period during which our investments are not match-funded, the income earned on such investments may respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may immediately and significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments. In addition, unless we enter into hedging or similar transactions with respect to the portion of our assets that we fund using our balance sheet, returns we achieve on such assets will generally increase as interest rates for those assets rise and decrease as interest rates for those assets decline. 
 
 For information about our risks related to recent increases in prevailing interest rates, see Macroeconomic trends including inflation, rising interest rates or recession may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations below. 
 
 Macroeconomic trends including inflation, rising interest rates or recession may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Macroeconomic trends, including increases in inflation and rising interest rates, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflation in the United States has recently accelerated to historically high levels and may continue at an elevated level in the near-term. Rising inflation could have an adverse impact on general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental revenue, interest income or other revenue. Inflationary pressures have increased our direct and indirect operating and investment costs. With regard to our investments in the SFR and multifamily housing market, inflationary pressures have increased or may have the effect of increasing costs related to property management, third-party contractors and vendors, insurance, transportation and taxes, and residents may also be adversely impacted by higher cost of living expenses, including food, energy and transportation, which may increase the rate of tenant defaults and harm our operating results. With regard to our commercial properties, inflationary pressures have increased or may have the effect of increasing our costs related to property management, third-party contractors and vendors, insurance, transportation and taxes, and our commercial tenants may be adversely impacted by higher operating expenses, which may increase the rate of tenant defaults and harm our operating results. 
 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve began rapidly raising the federal funds rate to decade-high levels in 2022 to combat inflation and restore price stability, and has signaled that the federal funds rate may continue to rise in 2023. In addition, the Federal Reserve began a quantitative tightening program in June of 2022. The combination of these actions have resulted in an increase in prevailing interest rates and a flattening of the yield curve. Certain of our investments pay interest at a fixed rate, and the relative value of the fixed cash flows from these investments will decrease as prevailing interest rates rise or increase as prevailing interest rates fall, causing potentially significant changes in value. In addition, to the extent our exposure to increases in interest rates on any of our debt is not eliminated through interest rate swaps and interest rate protection agreements that we may utilize for hedging purposes, such increases will result in higher debt service costs which will adversely affect our cash flows. We cannot assure you that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. Such future constraints could increase our borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments, which could slow or deter future growth. 
 
 In addition, these actions by the Federal Reserve, as well as efforts by other central banks globally to combat inflation and restore price stability and other global events, may raise the prospect or severity of a recession. The war in Ukraine adds, and other international tensions or escalations of conflict may add, instability to the uncertainty driving socioeconomic forces, which may continue to have an impact on global trade and result in inflation or economic instability. The COVID-19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases may also generally impair the performance of investments, increase funding costs, limit access to the capital markets or result in decisions by lenders not to extend credit. Present conditions and the state of the U.S and global economies make it difficult to predict whether and/or when and to what extent a recession will occur in the near future. Should a recession occur, or if one already exists and worsens in the future, it could negatively impact the value of commercial and residential real estate and the value of our investments, potentially materially. While the Company has taken steps to prepare for a potential downturn in the economy, should a recession occur, or if one already exists and worsens in the future, there can be no guaranty that the Company s efforts will prevent any negative impacts to the value of the Company s investments. 

Our loans and investments may be subject to fluctuations in interest rates that may not be adequately protected, or protected at all, by our hedging strategies. 
 
 Our investments may include loans with either floating interest rates or fixed interest rates. Floating rate loans earn interest at rates that adjust from time to time (typically monthly) based upon an index (typically the one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR or SOFR). These floating rate loans are insulated from changes in value specifically 
 22

 due to changes in interest rates; however, the coupons they earn fluctuate based upon interest rates (again, typically one-month LIBOR or SOFR) and, in a declining and/or low interest rate environment, these loans would earn lower rates of interest and this would impact our operating performance. Conversely, in an increasing and/or high interest rate environment, these loans would earn higher rates of interest, which would also impact our operating performance. Fixed interest rate loans, however, do not have adjusting interest rates and the relative value of the fixed cash flows from these loans will decrease as prevailing interest rates rise or increase as prevailing interest rates fall, causing potentially significant changes in value. We may employ various hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates (and in some cases credit spreads), including engaging in interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate derivative products. We believe that no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate changes and there is a risk that such strategies may provide no protection at all and potentially compound the impact of changes in interest rates. Hedging transactions involve certain additional risks such as counterparty risk, leverage risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and a change in current period expense. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to enter into hedging transactions or that such hedging transactions will adequately protect us against the foregoing risks. 
 
 Accounting for derivatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP may be complicated. Any failure by us to meet the requirements for applying hedge accounting in accordance with GAAP could adversely affect our earnings. In particular, derivatives are required to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged items (and appropriately designated and/or documented as such). If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued and the changes in fair value of the instrument are included in our reported net income. 
 
 Investments in equity securities are subject to variation in their prices. 
 
 The prices of equity securities which we have invested in may fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common equity represents a share of ownership in a company, and rank junior to debt and preferred equity in their claim on the company s assets in the event of bankruptcy. 
 
 We may use leverage in our investment program, resulting in a greater risk of loss. 
 
 We may use leverage in our investment program, including the use of borrowed funds and investments in certain types of options, such as puts, calls and warrants, which may be purchased for a fraction of the price of the underlying securities. While such strategies and techniques increase the opportunity to achieve higher returns on the amounts invested, they also increase the risk of loss. To the extent we purchase securities with borrowed funds, our net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed funds are not used. If the interest expense on borrowings were to exceed the net return on the portfolio securities purchased with borrowed funds, our use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return than if we were not leveraged. 
 
 We may invest in preferred equity securities which contain provisions that may result in a decline in the value of such preferred security in certain situations. 
 
 We may invest in preferred equity securities which contain provisions that may result in a decline in the value of such preferred security in certain situations. Preferred stock, which may include preferred stock in real estate transactions, represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer that pays dividends at a specified rate and that has precedence over common stock in the payment of dividends. In the event an issuer of preferred stock is liquidated or declares bankruptcy, the claims of creditors and owners of debt take precedence over the claims of those who own preferred and common stock. If interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred stocks may be less attractive, causing the price of preferred stocks to decline. Preferred stock may have mandatory sinking company provisions, as well as provisions allowing the stock to be called or redeemed prior to its maturity, which can have a negative impact on the stock s price when interest rates decline. Unlike interest on debt securities, preferred stock dividends may only be payable if declared by the issuer s board of directors or other governing body. The value of convertible preferred stock can depend heavily upon the value of the security into which such convertible preferred stock is converted, depending on whether the market price of the underlying security exceeds the conversion price. 
 
 We may invest in or write options on securities, which may result in our bearing the risk of loss should the underlying security change in value during the life of the option. 
 
 We may invest in options on securities, which may result in our bearing the risk of loss should the underlying security decline in value during the life of the option. There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities. For example, there are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 imperfect correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. A transaction in options or securities may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. 
 
 If we write a covered call option, we forgo, during the option s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call, but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation and once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it must deliver the underlying security in exchange for the strike price. 
 
 If we write a covered put option, we bear the risk of loss if the value of the underlying stock declines below the exercise price minus the put premium. If the option is exercised, we could incur a loss if it is required to purchase the stock underlying the put option at a price greater than the market price of the stock at the time of exercise plus the put premium we received when we wrote the option. While our potential gain in writing a covered put option would be limited to distributions earned on the liquid assets securing the put option plus the premium received from the purchaser of the put option we risk a loss equal to the entire exercise price of the option minus the put premium. 
 
 We may enter into reverse repurchase transactions, which are subject to the risk that the securities subject to such reverse repurchase transaction may decline in value or that securities purchased with the proceeds of such reverse repurchase transaction will decline in value below the market value of the securities we are required to repurchase. 
 
 We may enter into reverse repurchase transactions with banks and securities dealers. A reverse repurchase transaction is a repurchase transaction in which we are the seller of, rather than the investor in, securities or other assets and agree to repurchase them at a date certain or on demand. Use of a reverse repurchase transaction may be preferable to a regular sale and later repurchase of securities or other assets because it avoids certain market risks and transaction costs. Reverse repurchase transactions involve the risk that the market value of securities and/or other assets purchased by us with the proceeds received by us in connection with such reverse repurchase transactions may decline below the market value of the securities we are obligated to repurchase under such reverse repurchase transactions. They also involve the risk that the counterparty liquidates the securities delivered to it by us under the reverse repurchase agreement following the occurrence of an event of default under the reverse repurchase agreement by us. At the time when we enter into a reverse repurchase transactions, liquid securities (cash, U.S. Government securities or other debt obligations) of ours having a value at least as great as the purchase price of the securities to be purchased are expected to be segregated on our books throughout the period of the obligation. The use of these investment strategies may increase NAV fluctuation. 
 
 We may engage in the short sale of securities, which involves the risk of significant loss in the event the price of the borrowed securities appreciates before the short position closes out. 
 
 We may engage in the short sale of securities, which involves the risk of significant loss in the event the price of the borrowed securities appreciates before the short position closes out. Short sales by us that are not made where there is an offsetting long position in the asset that it is being sold short theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase. Short selling allows us to profit from declines in market prices to the extent such decline exceeds the transaction costs and costs of borrowing the securities. However, since the borrowed securities must be replaced by purchases at market prices in order to close out the short position, any appreciation in the price of the borrowed securities would result in a loss. Purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the price of securities to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. We may mitigate such losses by replacing the securities sold short before the market price has increased significantly. Under adverse market conditions, we might have difficulty purchasing securities to meet margin calls on its short sale delivery obligations, and might have to sell portfolio securities to raise the capital necessary to meet its short sale obligations at a time when fundamental investment considerations would not favor such sales. 
 
 If other short positions of the same security are closed out at the same time, a short squeeze can occur where demand exceeds the supply for the security sold short. A short squeeze makes it more likely that we will need to replace the borrowed security at an unfavorable price. 
 
 We may invest in structured finance securities, which are subject to the risk of default on the underlying obligation, increased sensitivity to defaults due to previous defaults and the disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation of defaults and aversion to certain structured finance securities as a class. 
 
 A portion of our investments may consist of structured finance securities, such as CMBS, collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized bond obligations, CLOs or similar instruments. Such structured finance securities are generally backed by an asset or a pool of assets, which serve as collateral. Depending on the type of security, the collateral may take the form of a portfolio of mortgage loans or bonds or other assets. We and other investors in structured finance securities ultimately bear the credit risk of the underlying collateral. In some instances, the structured finance securities are issued in 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 multiple tranches, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics, often categorized as senior, mezzanine and subordinated/equity according to their degree of risk. The riskiest securities are the equity tranche, which bears the bulk of defaults from the bonds or loans serving as collateral, and thus may protect the other, more senior tranches from default. If there are defaults or the relevant collateral otherwise underperforms, scheduled payments to senior tranches of such securities take precedence over those of mezzanine tranches, and scheduled payments to mezzanine tranches take precedence over those to subordinated/equity tranches. A senior tranche typically has higher ratings and lower yields than the underlying securities, and may be rated investment grade. Despite the protection from the equity tranche, other tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults, increased sensitivity to defaults due to previous defaults and the disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation of defaults and aversion to certain structured finance securities as a class. 
 
 We may invest in emerging markets, where investments are subject to additional risks and price volatility. 
 
 We may invest in emerging markets, where investments are subject to additional risks and price volatility. Any investments in issuers based in emerging market countries (countries in which the capital markets are developing), or in securities issued by foreign governments, may involve greater risks than investments in more developed markets and the prices of such investments may be more volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of our investments and the income they generate, as well as our ability to repatriate such amounts. 
 
 We may be subject to risks involved in investment activity through joint ventures. 
 
 We may acquire investments through joint ventures when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. Joint venture investments involve risks, including: the possibility that joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due; that we may be responsible to joint venture partners for indemnifiable losses; that joint venture partners might at any time have business or economic goals which are inconsistent with ours; and that joint venture partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our recommendations, instructions or requests. In some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. Further, joint venture partners may fail to meet their obligations to the joint venture as a result of financial distress or otherwise, and we would be forced to make contributions to maintain the value of the investments. To the extent joint venture partners do not meet their obligations to the joint venture or they take action inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture, we could be adversely affected. 
 
 If we acquire investments through joint ventures, we may be required to make decisions jointly with the other investors who have interests in the respective joint ventures. We might not have the same interests as the other investors in relation to these decisions or transactions. Accordingly, we might not be able to favorably resolve any of these issues, or we might have to provide financial or other inducements to the other investors to obtain a favorable resolution. 
 
 In addition, various restrictive provisions and third-party rights, including consent rights to certain transactions, may apply to sales or transfers of interests in joint ventures. Consequently, decisions to buy or sell interests in a property or properties relating to joint ventures may be subject to the prior consent of other investors. These restrictive provisions and third-party rights would potentially preclude us from achieving full value of the investments because of our inability to obtain the necessary consents to sell or transfer the interests. 
 
 Our investments may be concentrated in terms of type of interest, geography, asset types, industry and sponsors and may continue to be so in the future. 
 
 We intend to focus primarily on investing in various real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to equity, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity. In addition to our commercial real estate focus, our investments may be concentrated in terms of property type (e.g. retail vs. office), geography, asset type, industry and sponsors, as we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria, except as may be set forth in the investment guidelines adopted by our Board. Any such concentration of our investments that are subject to relatively higher risk of issuer bankruptcy, default, foreclosure or other risks may cause our Portfolio to have overall higher risks than it otherwise would. A significant portion of our investments are currently in securities of issuers that are advised, directly or indirectly, by affiliates of our Adviser. In addition, our operating properties are currently all based in Texas. The Portfolio, based on net equity, is comprised of 91.9 investments in entities managed by or advised by affiliates of the Adviser. Any concentration of our investments may continue, vary from time to time or become more prevalent in the future. 
 
 Investment concentration may cause even modest changes in the value of the underlying assets to significantly impact the value of our investments. As a result of any high levels of concentration, any adverse economic, political or other conditions that disproportionately affects those geographic areas, asset classes or investments concentrated in other terms 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 could have a magnified adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, and the value of our shareholders investments could vary more widely than if we invested in a more diverse Portfolio. 
 
 We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable properties, loans and investments in commercial real estate and could also affect the yields of these assets. 
 
 A number of entities compete with us to make the types of loans and investments, including the acquisition of real estate, that we make. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to invest in commercial real estate on attractive terms. In investing in commercial real estate, we compete with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by affiliates of our Adviser and Sponsor), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for lending and investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, offer more attractive pricing or other terms and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for investments in commercial real estate may lead to the yields of such assets decreasing, which may further limit our ability to generate satisfactory returns. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable loans and investments in commercial real estate may be limited in the future, and we may not be able to take advantage of attractive lending and investment opportunities that may exist from time to time, as we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and invest in loans or make other investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. 
 
 Prepayment rates may adversely affect the value of loans in which we invest. 
 
 The value of our assets may be affected by prepayment rates on loans. If we invest in issuers that acquire or invest in mortgage-related securities or a pool of mortgage securities, we anticipate that the mortgage loans or the underlying mortgages will prepay at a projected rate generating an expected yield. If the assets are purchased at a premium to the par value or principal balance of the security or loans, when borrowers prepay their loans faster than expected, the corresponding prepayments on the mortgage-related securities may reduce the expected yield on such securities because the related premium will have to be amortized on an accelerated basis. Conversely, if the assets are purchased at a discount to either the principal balance of the loans or the par value of the loans underlying the securities, when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans slower than expected, the decrease in corresponding prepayments on the mortgage-related securities may reduce the expected yield on such securities because the related discount will not accrete as quickly as originally anticipated. Prepayment rates on loans may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of mortgage credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which the related properties are located, the servicing of the mortgage loans, possible changes in tax laws, changes in interest rates, other opportunities for investment, homeowner mobility and other economic, social, geographic, demographic and legal factors and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks. In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on loans generally increase, though prepayment rates on loans are not guaranteed to remain the same or decrease in periods of increasing interest rates. If general interest rates decline at the same time, the proceeds of such prepayments received are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid. In addition, as a result of the risk of prepayment, the market value of the prepaid assets may benefit less than other fixed income securities from declining interest rates. Prepayment rates could have an adverse effect on other of our portfolio investments, including any debt investments and preferred equity investments or on additional investments we may make in the future. 
 
 The lack of liquidity in certain of our investments may adversely affect our business. 
 
 The illiquidity of certain of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. Certain investments such as real property, debt securities (including participations) and preferred equity, in particular, may be relatively illiquid investments. Illiquidity may result from the absence of an established market for the investments as well as legal, contractual or other restrictions on their resale and other factors. In addition, certain of our investments may become less liquid after our investment as a result of periods of delinquencies or defaults by borrowers or tenants or turbulent market conditions, which may make it more difficult for us to dispose of such assets at advantageous times or in a timely manner. Moreover, many of the loans and securities we invest in will not be registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in prohibitions against their transfer, sale, pledge or their disposition except in transactions that are exempt from registration requirements or are otherwise in accordance with such laws. Also, if in order to permit resale the securities are registered under the Securities Act at our expense, our expenses would be increased. As a result, we expect many of our investments may be illiquid, and if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 Portfolio quickly, for example as a result of loan defaults, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. Further, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment to the extent that we or our Adviser and/or its affiliates has or could be attributed as having material, non-public information regarding such business entity. As a result, our ability to vary our Portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our success depends on the availability of attractive loans and investments and our Adviser s ability to identify, structure, consummate, leverage, manage and realize returns on our loans and investments. 
 
 Our operating results are dependent upon the availability of attractive loans and investments, as well as our Adviser s ability to identify, structure, consummate, leverage, manage and realize returns on our loans and investments. In general, the availability of favorable investment opportunities and, consequently, our returns, will be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, conditions in the financial markets, general economic conditions, the demand for loan and investment opportunities in commercial real estate and the supply of capital for such opportunities. We cannot make any assurances that our Adviser will be successful in identifying and consummating loans and investments that satisfy our rate of return objectives or that such loans and investments, once made, will perform as anticipated. 
 
 Any distressed loans or investments we make, or loans or investments that later become distressed, may subject us to losses and other risks relating to bankruptcy proceedings. 
 
 Our loans and investments may include making distressed investments from time to time (e.g., investments in defaulted, out-of-favor or distressed bank loans and debt securities) or may involve investments that become non-performing following our acquisition thereof. Certain of our investments may include properties that typically are highly leveraged, with significant burdens on cash flow and, therefore, involve a high degree of financial risk. During an economic downturn or recession, loans or securities of financially or operationally troubled borrowers or issuers are more likely to go into default than loans or securities of other borrowers or issuers. Loans or securities of financially or operationally troubled issuers are less liquid and more volatile than loans or securities of borrowers or issuers not experiencing such difficulties. The market prices of such securities, if a market price is observable, are subject to erratic and abrupt market movements and the spread between bid and asked prices may be greater than normally expected. These securities are subject to a multitude of legal, industry, market, environmental and governmental forces that make analysis inherently difficult. Further, we rely on management, outside experts, market participants and the Adviser to analyze potential investments for us. There can be no assurance that any of these sources will prove credible, or that the resulting analysis will produce accurate conclusions. Investment in the loans or securities of financially or operationally troubled borrowers or issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk. 
 
 In certain limited cases (e.g., in connection with a workout, restructuring and/or foreclosing proceedings involving one or more of our investments), the success of our investment strategy with respect thereto will depend, in part, on our ability to effectuate loan modifications and/or restructure and improve the operations of the borrower entities. The activity of identifying and implementing successful restructuring programs and operating improvements entails a high degree of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and implement successful restructuring programs and improvements with respect to any distressed loans or investments we may have from time to time. 
 
 These financial difficulties may not be overcome and may cause borrower entities to become subject to bankruptcy or other similar administrative proceedings. There is a possibility that we may incur substantial or total losses on our loans and investments and, in certain circumstances, become subject to certain additional potential liabilities that may exceed the value of our original investment therein. For example, under certain circumstances, a lender that has inappropriately exercised control over the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to our investments, we may lose our entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than our original investment and/or may be required to accept different terms, including payment over an extended period of time. In addition, under certain circumstances, payments to us may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, preferential payment, or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. Furthermore, bankruptcy laws and similar laws applicable to administrative proceedings may delay our ability to realize on collateral for loan positions held by us, may adversely affect the economic terms and priority of such loans through doctrines such as equitable subordination or may result in a restructuring of the debt through principles such as the cramdown provisions of the bankruptcy laws. 
 
 We may not have control over certain of our loans and investments. 
 
 Our ability to manage our Portfolio of loans and investments may be limited by the form in which they are made. In certain situations, we may: 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 acquire investments subject to rights of senior classes and servicers under intercreditor or servicing agreements; 
 
 acquire only a minority and/or a non-controlling participation in an underlying investment; 
 
 co-invest with others through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, thereby acquiring non-controlling interests; or 
 
 rely on independent third-party management or servicing with respect to the management of an asset. 
 
 Therefore, we may not be able to exercise control over all aspects of our loans or investments. Such financial assets may involve risks not present in investments where senior creditors, junior creditors, servicers or third parties controlling investors are not involved. Our rights to control the process following a borrower default may be subject to the rights of senior or junior creditors or servicers whose interests may not be aligned with ours. A partner or co-venturer may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such asset, may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, or may be in a position to take action contrary to our investment objectives. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners or co-venturers. 
 
 We may make preferred equity investments in entities over which we will not have voting control. We intend to ensure that the terms of our investments require that the respective entities take all actions necessary to preserve our REIT status and avoid taxation at the REIT level. However, because we will not control such entities, they may cause us to fail one or more of the REIT tests. In that event, we intend to take advantage of all available provisions in the REIT statutes and regulations to cure any such failure, which provisions may require payments of penalties. We believe that we will be successful in maintaining our REIT status, but no assurances can be given. 
 
 Investments that are subordinated or otherwise junior in an issuer s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures expose us to greater risk of loss. 
 
 We may invest in debt and preferred equity that are subordinated or otherwise junior in an issuer s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Our investments in subordinated debt and preferred equity and our remedies with respect thereto, including the ability to foreclose on any collateral securing such investments, are subject to the rights of any senior creditors. Significant losses related to such loans or investments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Investments in subordinated debt and preferred equity also bear a greater risk of default than senior debt and may receive payments after the holders on the more senior tranches of debt instruments with respect to an issuer. 
 
 We may invest in senior loans, a significant portion of which may be below investment grade, which the borrower may fail to repay or which may decline in value due to changes in interest rates. 
 
 We may invest in senior loans, a significant portion of which may be below investment grade, which the borrower may fail to repay or which may decline in value due to changes in interest rates. Loans below investment grade are considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. As with any debt instrument, senior loans are generally subject to the risk of price declines and to increases in interest rates, particularly long term rates. Senior loans are also subject to the risk that, as interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, which may increase the risk of default. In addition, the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in short-term interest rates; long-term interest rates can vary dramatically from short-term interest rates. Therefore, senior loans may not mitigate price declines in a rising long term interest rate environment. The secondary market for loans is generally less liquid than the market for higher grade debt. Less liquidity in the secondary trading market could adversely affect the price at which we could sell a loan, and could adversely affect our income. The volume and frequency of secondary market trading in such loans varies significantly over time and among loans. Although senior loans in which we may invest may often be secured by collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation of such collateral would satisfy the borrower s obligation in the event of a default or that such collateral could be readily liquidated. 
 
 We may not realize gains or income from our investments. 
 
 We seek to generate both current income and capital appreciation from our investments. However, it is possible that our investments will not appreciate in value and some investments may decline in value. In addition, the obligors on any loans in which we invest may default on, or be delayed in making, interest and/or principal payments, especially given that we may invest in sub-performing and non-performing loans or in securitizations of loans or in transitional loans. Accordingly, we are subject to an increased risk of loss and may not be able to realize gains or income from our investments. Moreover, any gains that we do realize may not be sufficient to offset our losses and expenses. 
 
 Real estate valuation is inherently subjective and uncertain. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

The valuation of real estate, and therefore the valuation of any underlying security relating to loans and/or estate investments made by us is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location, the expected future rental revenues from that particular property and the valuation methodology adopted. As a result, the valuations of the real estate assets against which we make loans and/or investments are subject to a large degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions and methodologies that may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility, low transaction flow or restricted debt availability in the commercial or residential real estate markets. 
 
 Some of our portfolio investments may be recorded at fair value not readily available and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments. 
 
 Some or all of our portfolio investments may be in the form of positions or securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. Our Adviser will value these investments at fair value which may include unobservable inputs. Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our Adviser s determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our Adviser s determinations regarding the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. 
 
 We may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets. 
 
 A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment against such assets under GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the original acquisition cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we experience a decline in the fair value of our assets, it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The due diligence process that our Adviser undertakes in regard to investment opportunities may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment and if our Adviser incorrectly evaluates the risks of our loans and investments, we may experience losses. 
 
 Before making investments for us, including in any loans, our Adviser will conduct due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances relevant to each potential investment. When conducting due diligence, our Adviser may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of potential investment. Relying on the resources available to it, our Adviser will evaluate our potential investments based on criteria it deems appropriate for the relevant investment. Our Adviser s loss estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. If our Adviser underestimates the asset-level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular investment, we may experience losses with respect to such investment. 
 
 Insurance on investments may not cover all losses. 
 
 There are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism, acts of war, social unrest and civil disturbances, which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, also might result in insurance proceeds being insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds received with respect to a property relating to one of our investments might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to our investment. Any uninsured loss could result in the corresponding nonperformance of or loss on our investment related to such property. 
 
 Terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war or a prolonged economic slowdown may affect the real estate industry generally and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We cannot predict the severity of the effect that potential future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war would have on us. We may suffer losses as a result of the adverse impact of any future attacks and these losses may 
 29

 adversely impact our performance and may cause the market value of our securities to decline or be more volatile. In addition, a prolonged economic slowdown, a recession or declining real estate values, including, among other things, as a result of pandemics, inflation or rising interest rates, could impair the performance of our investments and harm our financial condition and results of operations, increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. Losses resulting from these types of events may not be fully insurable. 
 
 The absence of affordable insurance coverage may adversely affect the general real estate market, including lending volume, and the market s overall liquidity and may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and the pace at which we are able to make investments. If the properties underlying our interests are unable to obtain affordable insurance coverage, the value of our interests could decline, and in the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of our investment. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 
 We may need to foreclose on certain loans and/or exercise our foreclosure option under the terms of investments we may acquire, which could result in losses that harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We may find it necessary or desirable to foreclose on certain loans and/or exercise our foreclosure option under the terms of loans we acquire, and this process may be lengthy and expensive. We cannot assure you as to the adequacy of the protection of the terms of the applicable loan or investment, including the validity or enforceability of the loan and/or investments and the maintenance of the anticipated priority and perfection of the applicable security interests, if any. Furthermore, claims may be asserted by lenders or borrowers that might interfere with enforcement of our rights. Borrowers may resist foreclosure actions by asserting numerous claims, counterclaims and defenses against us, including, without limitation, lender liability claims and defenses, even when the assertions may have no basis in fact, in an effort to prolong the foreclosure action and seek to force the lender into a modification of the loan or a favorable buy-out of the borrower s position in the loan. In some states, foreclosure actions can take several years or more to litigate. At any time prior to or during the foreclosure proceedings, the borrower may file for bankruptcy, which would have the effect of staying the foreclosure actions and further delaying the foreclosure process and potentially result in a reduction or discharge of a borrower s debt. Foreclosure may create a negative public perception of the related property, resulting in a diminution of its value. Even if we are successful in foreclosing on a loan and/or investment, the liquidation proceeds upon sale of the underlying real estate may not be sufficient to recover our cost basis in the loan and/or investment, resulting in a loss to us. Furthermore, any costs or delays involved in the foreclosure of the loan and/or investment or a liquidation of the underlying property will further reduce the net proceeds and, thus, increase the loss. 
 
 Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire or the properties underlying our investments. 
 
 Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. 
 
 The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner s ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our investments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant investment held by us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property upon a default and foreclosure of one of our investments and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 We may be subject to lender liability claims, and if we are held liable under such claims, we could be subject to losses. 
 
 In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed lender liability. Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders. We cannot assure prospective investors that such claims will not arise or that we will not be subject to significant liability if a claim of this type did arise. 
 
 Compliance with various laws and regulations, including accessibility, building and health and safety laws and regulations, may be costly, may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability. 
 30

In addition to compliance with environmental regulations, we or underlying property owners for our investments must comply with various laws and regulations such as accessibility, building, zoning, landlord/tenant and health and safety laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the ADA and the Fair Housing Act. Some of those laws and regulations may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. Under those laws and regulations, we or underlying property owners for our investments may be liable for, among other things, the costs of bringing our properties into compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements. Noncompliance with certain of these laws and regulations may result in liability without regard to fault and the imposition of fines and could give rise to actions brought against us or the underlying property owners for our investments by governmental entities and/or third parties who claim to be or have been damaged as a consequence of an underlying property not being in compliance with the subject laws and regulations. As part of our due diligence procedures in connection with the acquisition of a property, we typically conduct an investigation of the property s compliance with known laws and regulatory requirements with which we must comply once we acquire a property, including a review of compliance with the ADA and local zoning regulations. Our investigations and these assessments may not have revealed, and may not with respect to future acquisitions reveal, all potential noncompliance issues or related liabilities and we can provide no assurance that our properties have been, or that our future projects will be, designed and built in accordance with all applicable legal requirements. In addition, there can be no guarantee that underlying property owners for our investments have conducted a similar or sufficient investigation of the property s compliance or liabilities, that they will in the future, or that any such properties will be designed, built and maintained in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
 
 Our ability to generate returns for our shareholders through our investment, finance and operating strategies is subject to then-existing market conditions, and we may make significant changes to these strategies in response to changing market conditions. 
 
 We seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term. We intend to achieve this objective primarily by originating, structuring and investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to equity, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity. In the future, to the extent that market conditions change and we have sufficient capital to do so, we may, depending on prevailing market conditions, change our investment guidelines in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our equity that will be invested in any commercial real estate property types at any given time. 
 
 If we fail to develop, enhance and implement strategies to adapt to changing conditions in the real estate industry and capital markets, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 The manner in which we compete and the types of assets in which we seek to invest will be affected by changing conditions resulting from sudden changes in our industry, regulatory environment, the role and structures of government-sponsored enterprises, the role of credit rating agencies or their rating criteria or process, or the U.S. and global economies generally. If we do not effectively respond to these changes, or if our strategies to respond to these changes are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we may not be successful in executing our business strategies and, even if we successfully implement our business strategies, we may not generate revenues or profits after we implement them. 
 
 Any credit ratings assigned to our loans and investments will be subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded. 
 
 Our loans and investments may be rated by rating agencies such as Moody s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings or Standard Poor s. Any credit ratings on our loans and investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce or withdraw, or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our loans and investments in the future, the value and liquidity of our investments could significantly decline, which would adversely affect the value of our Portfolio and could result in losses upon disposition. 
 
 We may invest in derivative instruments, which would subject us to increased risk of loss. 
 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may invest in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments, especially when purchased in large amounts, may not be liquid in all circumstances, so that in volatile markets we may not be able to close out a position without incurring a loss. The prices of derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, forwards and options, are highly volatile, and such instruments may subject us to significant losses. The value of such derivatives also depends upon the price of the underlying instrument or commodity. Such derivatives and other customized instruments also are subject to the risk of non-performance by the relevant counterparty. In addition, actual or implied daily 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 limits on price fluctuations and speculative position limits on the exchanges or over-the-counter OTC markets in which we may conduct our transactions in derivative instruments may prevent prompt liquidation of positions, subjecting us to the potential of greater losses. Derivative instruments that may be purchased or sold by us may include instruments not traded on an exchange. The risk of nonperformance by the obligor on such an instrument may be greater, and the ease with which we can dispose of or enter into closing transactions with respect to such an instrument may be less than in the case of an exchange-traded instrument. In addition, significant disparities may exist between bid and ask prices for derivative instruments that are traded OTC and not on an exchange. Such OTC derivatives are also typically not subject to the same type of investor protections or governmental regulation as exchange-traded instruments. 
 
 In addition, we may invest in derivative instruments that are neither presently contemplated nor currently available, but which may be developed in the future, to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with our investment objectives and legally permissible. Any such investments may expose us to unique and presently indeterminate risks, the impact of which may not be capable of determination until such instruments are developed and/or we determine to make such an investment. 
 
 The impact of financial reform legislation and legislation promulgated thereunder on us is uncertain. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act instituted a wide range of reforms that will have an impact on all financial institutions. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time, most of which will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Many of these regulations have yet to be promulgated or are only recently promulgated. In February 2017, former President Trump signed an executive order for a broad review of federal regulation of the U.S. financial system by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of the member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC ), a panel comprising top U.S. financial regulators. In May 2018, Congress passed, and former President Trump signed, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA ), which among other things, modified certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to mortgage lending, consumer protection, regulatory relief for large banks, regulatory relief for community banks and regulatory relief in securities markets. The EGRRCPA will relax or eliminate so-called enhanced regulation of banks falling into certain ranges of asset value and will impact the application of the Volcker Rule and the Basel III guidelines as to certain banks. Specifically, the EGRRCPA relaxed (or eliminated) certain risk-based capital and leverage requirements for community banks with less than 10 billion in assets that maintain a certain community bank leverage ratio that bank regulators are directed to develop, but the impact and effect of the foregoing on market liquidity is uncertain. It is possible that this or a future Congress will roll back some of the changes made by EGRRCPA to the Dodd-Frank Act and take a more active approach to banking and financial regulation than the prior Trump Administration, particularly to promote policy goals involving climate change, racial equity, environmental, social and governance matters, consumer financial protection and infrastructure, although it is not possible at this time to predict the nature or extent of any amendments. 
 
 In addition, the substance of regulatory supervision may be influenced through the appointment of individuals to the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory bodies. Measures focused on deregulation of the U.S. financial services industry may, among other things, decrease the restrictions on banks and other financial institutions and allow them to compete with us for investment opportunities that were previously not available to them. Measures focused on deregulation of the U.S. financial services industry may have the effect of increasing competition for our business. Increased competition from banks and other financial institutions in the credit markets could have the effect of reducing credit spreads, which may adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 Given the uncertainty associated with financial reform legislation, including the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and any legislative and/or regulatory actions under this or a future executive administration or Congress, the full impact such requirements will have on our business, results of operations or financial condition is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA, and other legislative actions may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements or address resulting changes in the mortgage loan market. While we cannot predict what effect any changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our business. In addition, failure to comply with any such laws, regulations or principles, or changes thereto, or to adapt to any changes in the marketplace, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 A change in the federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae and the U.S. government, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing for multifamily real estate in the United States and provide guarantees for CMBS securitizations held by issuers in which we have invested, and for CMBS securitizations 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 which we may further invest directly or indirectly in the future. Following significant credit losses and concerns of liquidity during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in the conservatorship of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (the FHFA ), their federal regulator, pursuant to its powers under The Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008, which was a part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Under this conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued equity and derivative securities to the U.S. government in exchange for capital infusions and were required to reduce the amount of mortgage loans they own or for which they provide guarantees. As conservator, the FHFA has assumed all the powers of the shareholders, directors and officers with the goal of preserving and conserving their assets. 
 
 Since the conservatorship began, the U.S. Congress has considered a substantial number of bills that include comprehensive or incremental approaches to ending the conservatorship, winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or changing their purposes, businesses or operations. U.S. government departments and agencies, including the U.S. Treasury and FHFA, have also published proposals which could lead to a release or exit from conservatorship. A decision by the U.S. government to eliminate or downscale Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or to reduce government support for multifamily housing more generally may adversely affect the availability of CMBS securitizations as an investment or cause breaches in underlying loan covenants, and, as a result, may adversely affect our investments. It may also adversely affect underlying interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily assets, which may also adversely affect our investments. In addition, reforms regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could negatively impact our ability to maintain an exclusion or exemption from the Investment Company Act. 
 
 Recent events related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic slowdown raised concerns that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may have needed additional capital in order to meet their obligations as guarantors on trillions of dollars of CMBS securitizations, and future events may generate similar concerns. The market value of CMBS securitizations guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac today are highly dependent on the continued support by the U.S. government. If such support is modified or withdrawn, if the U.S. Treasury fails to inject new capital as needed or if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are released from conservatorship, the market value of the CMBS securitizations they guaranteed could significantly decline, making it difficult to obtain repurchase agreement financing and could force holders of CMBS securitizations to sell assets at substantial losses. Furthermore, any policy changes to the relationship between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. government may create market uncertainty and have the effect of reducing the actual or perceived credit quality of the CMBS securitizations. It may also interrupt the cash flow received by investors on the underlying CMBS. 
 
 All of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the availability, pricing, liquidity, market value and financing of our assets or investments and materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and book value per common share. 
 
 The securitization process is subject to an evolving regulatory environment that may affect certain aspects of our current business. 
 
 As a result of the dislocation of the credit markets during the great recession from 2007-2009, and in anticipation of more extensive regulation, including regulations promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the securitization industry has crafted and continues to craft changes to securitization practices, including changes to representations and warranties in securitization transaction documents, new underwriting guidelines and disclosure guidelines. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, various federal agencies, including the SEC, have promulgated regulations with respect to issues that affect securitizations. 
 
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, a collection of federal agencies have adopted a joint risk retention rule (the Risk Retention Rule that generally requires the sponsor of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the securities. The rule generally prohibits the sponsor or its affiliates from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise selling or transferring the retained credit risk for a specified period of time, depending on the type of asset that is securitized. For purposes of the rule, the term asset-backed security means a fixed-income or other security collateralized by any type of self-liquidating financial asset (including a loan, a lease, a mortgage, or a secured or unsecured receivable) that allows the holder of the security to receive payments that depend primarily on cash flow from the asset, including, among other things, a collateralized mortgage obligation or a collateralized debt obligation. The Risk Retention Rule provides a variety of exemptions, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as qualified residential mortgages, which are defined in turn as qualified mortgage loans under the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection s Ability to Repay Rule. As part of our strategy, we may acquire investments in commercial real estate that are not qualified mortgage loans (such as loans made primarily for business purposes). If we sponsor the securitization of such assets, we may be required to retain 5 of the credit risk of those assets, which would expose us to loss and could increase the administrative and operational cost of asset securitization, and additionally may be required to comply with significant disclosure, review and reporting requirements applicable to asset securitization.

On February 9, 2018, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held, in The Loan Syndications and Trading Association v. Securities and Exchange Commission and Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the LSTA Decision ), that collateral managers of open market CLOs (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market are not securitizers or sponsors under the risk retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the Risk Retention Rule. In reaching this decision, the panel determined, among other things, that an asset manager that was not in the chain of title on the transferred assets nor possessed them could not be required to retain risk that it had never held. Although the LSTA Decision is limited by its terms to asset managers of open market CLOs, the court s analysis may have broader implications with respect to compliance with the Risk Retention Rule, especially in the context of managed funds that utilize securitizations. Even though we have an Adviser, we may be considered a securitizer or sponsor of securitizations, requiring us to hold risk retention in accordance with the Risk Retention Rule and to comply with disclosure, review and reporting requirements applicable to asset securitizations. 
 
 The current regulatory environment may be impacted by future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including provisions setting forth capital and risk retention requirements. In particular, the EGRRCPA makes certain modifications to post-financial crisis regulatory requirements, including, among other things, improving consumer access to mortgage credit and tailoring regulations for certain bank holding companies, including raising the relevant thresholds for the application of the U.S. Federal Reserve s enhanced prudential standards, as well as for the designation by the FSOC of non-bank financial companies as systemically important. The EGRRCPA has resulted and may further result in significant modifications to certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other post-financial crisis regulatory requirements. 
 
 These legislative developments, and other proposed regulations affecting securitization, could alter the structure of securitizations in the future, pose additional risks to our participation in future securitizations or reduce or eliminate the economic incentives for participating in future securitizations, increase the costs associated with our origination, securitization or acquisition activities, or otherwise increase the risks or costs of our doing business. 
 
 Rapid changes in the values of our real estate investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. 
 
 If the market value or income potential of real estate-related investments declines as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment rates or other factors, we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exclusion from Investment Company Act regulation. If a decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of any non-qualifying assets that we may own. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the REIT and Investment Company Act considerations. 
 
 As a consequence of our seeking to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act on an ongoing basis, we and/or our subsidiaries may be restricted from making certain investments or may structure investments in a manner that would be less advantageous to us than would be the case in the absence of such requirements. In particular, a change in the value of any of our assets could negatively affect our ability to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act and cause the need for a restructuring of our Portfolio. For example, these restrictions may limit our and our subsidiaries ability to invest directly in mortgage-backed securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of senior loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations and certain asset-backed securities, non-controlling equity interests in real estate companies or in assets not related to real estate. In addition, seeking to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act may cause us and/or our subsidiaries to acquire or hold additional assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or held or dispose of investments that we and/or our subsidiaries might not have otherwise disposed of, which could result in higher costs or lower proceeds to us than we would have paid or received if we were not seeking to comply with such requirements. Thus, avoiding registration under the Investment Company Act may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we and our subsidiaries will be able to successfully avoid operating as an unregistered investment company. If it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company, and that we would be subject to limitations on corporate leverage that would have an adverse impact on our investment returns.

Table of Contents 

 If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use borrowings), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and Portfolio composition, including disclosure requirements and restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Compliance with the Investment Company Act would, accordingly, limit our ability to make certain investments and require us to significantly restructure our business plan, which could materially adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company, and as such we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company as long as, on each annual determination date, we either (a) have an unaffiliated public float of less than 250 million on the annual determination date or (b) had annual revenues of less than 100 million as of the previously completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and on the annual determination date either (i) have no unaffiliated public float or (ii) have an unaffiliated public float of less than 700 million. If we fail to satisfy these conditions on the annual determination date in any year, we will cease to qualify as a smaller reporting company. Our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 exceeded the 100 million threshold specified in the smaller reporting company test. As a result, it is likely that we will not qualify as a smaller reporting company on the next annual determination date. If we do not qualify as a smaller reporting company, we may incur additional costs complying with enhanced reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. 
 
 Although we are a smaller reporting company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and place additional demands on management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner. 
 
 As a public company with listed equity securities, we are required to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), related regulations of the SEC, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the requirements of the NYSE. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our Board and management and will require us to incur significant costs and expenses. As a result of being a public company, we are required to: 
 
 institute and maintain a more comprehensive compliance function; 
 
 design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB 
 
 comply with rules promulgated by the NYSE; 
 
 prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws; 
 
 establish and maintain new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading; 
 
 involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and 
 
 establish and maintain an investor relations function. 
 
 If our profitability is adversely affected because of these additional costs, it could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing Strategy 
 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs. 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 171.3 million of indebtedness outstanding related to our Portfolio. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to acquire additional investments or pay the dividends necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following: 
 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes; 
 
 make it more difficult for us to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to meet operational needs; 
 
 force us to dispose of one or more of our investments, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject; 
 
 subject us to increased sensitivity to interest rate increases; 
 
 make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events; 
 
 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; 
 
 limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness; 
 
 reduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business, industry and economic conditions; and/or 
 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have relatively less debt than we have. 
 
 If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and trading price of our securities could be adversely affected. 
 
 Any credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), debt securities, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, securitizations or other debt arrangements may impose restrictive covenants, which may restrict our flexibility to determine our operating policies and investment strategy. 
 
 We may enter into agreements with various counterparties to finance our operations, which may include entering into credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, securitizations and/or issuing debt securities or other debt arrangements. The documents that govern these agreements may contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants applicable to us that may restrict our flexibility to determine our operating policies and investment strategy. For example, these agreements may require us to maintain a specific net debt to equity ratio, minimum NAV, senior debt service coverage ratio, consolidated unencumbered assets ratio, or, among others, specified minimum levels of capacity under our credit facilities and cash. As a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would otherwise choose, which could reduce our return on assets. If we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition and prospects could deteriorate significantly. In addition, lenders may require that our Adviser continue to serve in such capacity. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under these agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing collateral. We may also be subject to cross-default and acceleration rights in our other debt arrangements. Further, this could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the distribution requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Inability to access funding could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. 
 
 Our ability to fund our loans and investments may be impacted by our ability to secure bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), warehouse facilities and structured financing arrangements, public and private debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements and additional repurchase agreements on acceptable terms. We may also rely on short-term financing that would be especially exposed to changes in availability. Our access to sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors, over which we have little or no control, including: 
 
 general economic or market conditions; 
 36 

Table of Contents 

the market s view of the quality of our assets; 
 
 the market s perception of our growth potential; 
 
 our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and 
 
 the market price of our securities. 
 
 We may need to periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new loans and investments. Unfavorable economic or capital market conditions may increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or could result in a decision by our potential lenders not to extend credit. An inability to successfully access the capital markets could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and could decrease our earnings and liquidity. In addition, any dislocation or weakness in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or to increase the costs of that financing. In addition, as regulatory capital requirements imposed on our lenders are increased, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune time or price. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 We are subject to counterparty risk associated with our debt obligations. 
 
 Our counterparties for critical financial relationships may include both domestic and international financial institutions. These institutions could be severely impacted by credit market turmoil, changes in legislation, allegations of civil or criminal wrongdoing and may as a result experience financial or other pressures. In addition, if a lender or counterparty files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, our borrowings under financing agreements with them may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us, at least temporarily, of the benefit of these assets. Such an event could restrict our access to financing and increase our cost of capital. If any of our counterparties were to limit or cease operation, it could lead to financial losses for us. 
 
 Derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow. 
 
 Subject to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may pursue various hedging strategies and use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments, including hedging for future debt issuances. At other times, we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates. However, these hedging arrangements may not have the desired beneficial impact. Hedging arrangements, which can include a number of counterparties, may expose us to additional risks, including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts, and may involve extensive costs, such as transaction fees or, if we terminate them, breakage costs. No strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. 
 
 Any credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, securitizations or other debt arrangements that we may use to finance our assets may require us to provide additional collateral or pay down debt. 
 
 We may utilize credit facilities, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, securitizations and other forms of financing to finance our assets if they are available on acceptable terms. In the event we utilize these financing arrangements, they would involve the risk that the market value of our assets pledged or sold by us to the repurchase agreement counterparty, provider of the credit facility, lender of the warehouse facility or the securitization counterparty may decline in value, in which case the applicable creditor may require us to provide additional collateral or to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. We may not have the funds available to repay our debt at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. Posting additional collateral would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets. If we cannot meet these requirements, the applicable creditor could accelerate our indebtedness, increase the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow funds from them, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our business plan. In addition, in the event that the applicable creditor files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, our loans may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us, at least temporarily, of the benefit of these assets. Such an event could restrict our access to credit and increase our cost of capital. The applicable creditor may also require us to maintain a certain amount of cash or set aside assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position that would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. As a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose which could reduce our return on assets. In the event that we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition and prospects could deteriorate rapidly.

 If a counterparty to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the purchase agreement term, or if the value of the underlying asset has declined as of the end of that term, or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement, we may incur losses. 
 
 Under any repurchase agreements we enter into, we will sell the assets to lenders (i.e., repurchase agreement counterparties) and receive cash from the lenders. The lenders are obligated to resell the same assets back to us at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement. Because the cash that we receive from the lender when we initially sell the assets to the lender is less than the value of those assets (the difference being the haircut ), if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same assets back to us, we would incur a loss on the repurchase agreement equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). We would also incur losses on a repurchase agreement if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of the repurchase agreement term, because we would have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive assets worth less than that amount. Further, if we default on our obligations under a repurchase agreement, the lender will be able to terminate the repurchase agreement and cease entering into any other repurchase agreements with us. Any repurchase agreements we enter into are likely to contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any repurchase agreement, the lender can also declare a default with respect to all other repurchase agreements they have with us. If a default occurs under any of our repurchase agreements and a lender terminates one or more of its repurchase agreements, we may need to enter into replacement repurchase agreements with different lenders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such replacement repurchase agreements on the same terms as the repurchase agreements that were terminated or at all. Any losses that we incur on our repurchase agreements could adversely affect our earnings and thus our cash available for distribution to stockholders. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure 
 
 We have limited operating history as a REIT and may not be able to operate our business successfully, find suitable investments, or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 We ceased being an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act on July 1, 2022 and have limited operating history as a REIT. We may not be able to operate our business successfully, find suitable investments or implement our operating policies and strategies. Our ability to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term depends on our ability both to generate sufficient cash flow to pay an attractive dividend and to achieve capital appreciation, and we may not be able to do either. Similarly, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and make distributions to stockholders. The results of our operations will depend on several factors, including the availability of opportunities for the acquisition or origination of investments in commercial real estate, the level and volatility of interest rates, the availability of equity capital as well as adequate short- and long-term financing, conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions. 
 
 In addition, our future operating results and financial data may vary materially from the historical operating results and financial data contained in this annual report because of a number of factors. Consequently, the historical financial statements contained in this annual report may not be useful in assessing our likely future performance. 
 
 We depend upon key personnel of our Adviser and its affiliates. 
 
 We are an externally managed REIT and therefore we do not have any internal management capacity and expect to only have accounting employees. We will depend to a significant degree on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the management team and other key personnel of our Adviser, including Messrs. Dondero, Goetz, Mitts, McGraner, Sauter, Norris, Richards and Willmore, all of whom may be difficult to replace. We expect that our Adviser will evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and monitor our loans and investments in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement. 
 
 We will also depend upon the senior professionals of our Adviser to maintain relationships with sources of potential investments, and we intend to rely upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. We cannot assure you that these individuals will continue to provide indirect investment advice to us. If these individuals, including the members of the management team of our Adviser, do not maintain their existing relationships with our Adviser, maintain existing relationships or develop new relationships with other sources of investment opportunities, we may not be able to grow our Portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom the senior professionals of our Adviser have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities. Therefore, we can offer no assurance that these relationships will generate investment opportunities for us. 
 
 We are dependent upon our Adviser and its affiliates to conduct our day-to-day operations; thus, adverse changes in their financial health or our relationship with them could cause our operations to suffer.

Table of Contents 

 We are dependent on our Adviser and its affiliates to manage our operations and originate, structure and manage our loans and investments. All of our investment decisions are made by our Adviser, subject to general oversight by our Adviser s investment committee and our Board. Any adverse changes in the financial condition of our Adviser or its affiliates, or our relationship with our Adviser, could hinder our Adviser s ability to successfully manage our operations and our Portfolio, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 Our Adviser manages our Portfolio pursuant to very broad investment guidelines and is not required to seek the approval of our Board for each investment, financing, asset allocation or hedging decision made by it, which may result in our making riskier investments and which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 Our Adviser is authorized to follow very broad investment guidelines that provide it with substantial discretion in investment, financing, asset allocation and hedging decisions. Our Board will periodically review our investment guidelines and our Portfolio but will not, and is not required to, review and approve in advance all of our proposed investments or our Adviser s financing, asset allocation or hedging decisions. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our trustees may rely primarily on information provided, or recommendations made, to them by our Adviser or its affiliates. Subject to qualifying and maintaining our REIT qualification and our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, our Adviser has significant latitude within the broad investment guidelines in determining the types of investments it makes for us, and how such investments are financed or hedged, which could result in investment returns that are substantially below expectations or losses, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 We may not replicate the historical results achieved by other entities managed or sponsored by affiliates of our Adviser and members of our Adviser s management team or by our Sponsor or its affiliates. 
 
 Our primary focus in making investments generally differs from that of existing investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles that are or have been managed by affiliates of our Advisers, members of our Adviser s management team, our Sponsor or affiliates of our Sponsor. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve comparable results of those Sponsor affiliates. In addition, investors in our securities are not acquiring an interest in any such investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles that are or have been managed by members of our Adviser s management team or our Sponsor or its affiliates. We also cannot assure you that we will replicate the historical results achieved by members of the management team, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by them in prior periods. Additionally, all or a portion of the prior results may have been achieved in particular market conditions which may never be repeated. 
 
 The Advisory Agreement may be terminated by (a) us, upon a cause event (as defined in the Advisory Agreement), on 30 days written notice, (b) either party, without cause, upon the expiration of the then-current term with at least 180 days written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of such term, (c) our Adviser, upon 30 days written notice if we materially breach the agreement and such breach continues for 30 days before we are given such notice or (d) automatically in the event of an Advisers Act Assignment unless we provide written consent. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated for any one of these reasons, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The Advisory Agreement may be terminated by (a) us, upon a cause event (as defined in the Advisory Agreement), on 30 days written notice, (b) either party, without cause, upon the expiration of the then-current term with at least 180 days written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of such term, (c) our Adviser, upon 30 days written notice if we materially breach the agreement and such breach continues for 30 days before we are given such notice or (d) automatically in the event of an Advisers Act Assignment unless we provide written consent. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found, we may not be able to execute our business plan. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Adviser and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, the integration of such management and its lack of familiarity with our investment objectives may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we may incur certain costs in connection with a termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement, including a termination fee equal to three times the Adviser s annual Fee (unless the Advisory Agreement is terminated as a result of a cause event). 
 
 Our Adviser maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Our Adviser s liability is limited under the Advisory Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify our Adviser against certain liabilities. 
 
 Our Adviser maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser and its affiliates and their respective partners, members, officers, directors, employees and agents will not be liable to us (including but not limited to (1) any act or omission in connection with the conduct of our business 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 that is determined in good faith to be in or not opposed to our best interest, (2) any act or omission based on the suggestions of certain professional advisors, (3) any act or omission by us, or (4) any mistake, negligence, misconduct or bad faith of certain brokers or other agents), unless any act or omission constitutes bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties. We have also agreed to indemnify our Adviser and its affiliates and their respective partners, members, officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses that are incurred and arise out of or in connection with our business or investments, or the performance by the indemnitee of its responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement, provided that the conduct at issue did not constitute bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties. As a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which our Adviser would not be liable. 
 
 Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser will indemnify and hold us harmless from all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that are incurred by reason of our Adviser s bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties; provided, however, that our Adviser will not be held responsible for any action of our Board in following or declining to follow any written advice or written recommendation given by our Adviser. However, the aggregate maximum amount that our Adviser may be liable to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement will, to the extent not prohibited by law, never exceed the amount of the management fees received by our Adviser under the Advisory Agreement prior to the date that the acts or omissions giving rise to a claim for indemnification or liability have occurred. In addition, our Adviser will not be liable for special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, or consequential loss, or damage of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation lost profits. The limitations described in the preceding two sentences will not apply, however, to the extent such damages are determined in a final binding non-appealable court or arbitration proceeding to result from the bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our Adviser s duties. 
 
 We may change our targeted investments without shareholder consent. 
 
 We focus primarily on investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to equity, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity. Our target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, SFR, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. To a limited extent, we may also hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities. We may make adjustments to our target Portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities, and we may change our targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of our shareholders. Any such change could result in our making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments described in this annual report. These policies may change over time. A change in our targeted investments or investment guidelines, which may occur without notice to you or without your consent, may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, all of which could adversely affect the value of our securities and our ability to make distributions to you. We intend to disclose any changes in our investment policies in our next required periodic report. 
 
 We will pay substantial fees and expenses to our Adviser and its affiliates, which payments increase the risk that you will not earn a profit on your investment. 
 
 Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we will pay significant fees to our Adviser and its affiliates. Those fees include management fees and obligations to reimburse our Adviser and its affiliates for expenses they incur in connection with their providing services to us, including certain personnel services. Additionally, on January 30, 2023, our shareholders approved a long-term incentive plan that provides us the ability to grant awards to employees of our Adviser and its affiliates. For additional information on these fees and the fees paid to our Adviser, see Item 1. Business Our Advisory Agreement and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 
 If we internalize our management functions, we may not achieve the perceived benefits of the internalization transaction. 
 
 In the future, our Board may consider internalizing the functions performed for us by our Adviser by, among other methods, acquiring our Adviser s assets. The method by which we could internalize these functions could take many forms. There is no assurance that internalizing our management functions will be beneficial to us and our shareholders. An acquisition of our Adviser could result in dilution of your interest as a shareholder and could reduce earnings per share. Additionally, we may not realize the perceived benefits or we may not be able to properly integrate a new staff of managers and employees or we may not be able to effectively replicate the services provided previously by our Adviser or its affiliates. Internalization transactions, including, without limitation, transactions involving the acquisition of affiliated advisors have also, in some cases, been the subject of litigation. Even if these claims are without merit, we could be forced to spend significant amounts of money defending claims which would reduce the amount of funds available for us to invest 
 40

 and to pay distributions. All of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions. 
 
 There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns. 
 
 As a result of our arrangements with our Sponsor and our Adviser, there may be times when our Sponsor and our Adviser or their affiliated persons have interests that differ from those of our shareholders, giving rise to a conflict of interest. 
 
 Our trustees and management team serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, or of investment funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. Similarly, our Adviser or its affiliates may have other clients with similar, different or competing investment objectives, including, among others, NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. NXRT ), a publicly traded multi-family REIT, VineBrook Homes Trust, Inc. ("VineBrook"), an SFR REIT, NREF, a publicly traded mortgage REIT, and NHT, a publicly traded hospitality REIT listed on the TSXV, each of which is also managed by members of our management team. In serving in these multiple capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interest of us or our shareholders. For example, the management team of our Adviser has, and will continue to have, management responsibilities for other investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by our Adviser and its affiliates. Our investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of such affiliated investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles. As a result, those individuals may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among us and other investment funds or accounts advised by or affiliated with our Adviser and its affiliates. Our Adviser will seek to allocate investment opportunities among eligible accounts in a manner consistent with its allocation policy. However, we can offer no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time. 
 
 The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Highland Capital Management, L.P. Highland may have materially adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 On October 16, 2019, Highland, a former affiliate of our Sponsor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Highland Bankruptcy"), which was subsequently transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court ). On January 9, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved a change of control of Highland, which involved the resignation of James Dondero as the sole director of, and the appointment of an independent board to, Highland s general partner. On September 21, 2020, Highland filed a plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court, which was subsequently amended (the Fifth Amended Plan of Reorganization ). On October 9, 2020, Mr. Dondero resigned as an employee of Highland and as portfolio manager for all Highland-advised funds. As a result of these changes, our Sponsor is no longer under common control with Highland, and therefore Highland is no longer affiliated with us. On February 22, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming Highlands s Fifth Amended Plan of Reorganization (the Plan ), which became effective on August 11, 2021. On October 15, 2021, Marc S. Kirschner, as litigation trustee of a litigation subtrust formed pursuant to the Plan, filed a lawsuit (the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit against various persons and entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. The Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit does not include claims related to our business or our assets or operations. The Highland Bankruptcy and lawsuits filed in connection therewith, including the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit, could expose our Sponsor, our Adviser, our affiliates, our management and/or us to negative publicity, which might adversely affect our reputation and/or investor confidence in us, and/or future debt or equity capital raising activities. In addition, the Highland Bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit may be both time consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant diversion of management attention and resources which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the Highland Bankruptcy has and may continue to expose our Sponsor, our Adviser and our affiliates to claims arising out of our former relationship with Highland that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Litigation against James Dondero and others may have materially adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 On February 8, 2023, UBS Securities LLC and its affiliate (collectively, "UBS") filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against Mr. Dondero and a number of entities currently or previously affiliated with Mr. Dondero, seeking to collect on 1.3 billion in judgments UBS obtained against entities that were managed indirectly by Highland (the UBS Lawsuit ). The UBS Lawsuit does not include claims related to our business or our assets. While neither our Sponsor nor our Adviser are parties to the UBS Lawsuit, these proceedings could expose our Sponsor, our Adviser, our affiliates, our management and/or us to negative publicity, which might adversely affect our reputation and/or investor confidence in us, and/or future debt or equity capital raising activities. In addition, the UBS Lawsuit may be both time consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant diversion of management attention and resources which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of

 operations. The Board has formed an independent special committee to oversee a review of the UBS Lawsuit and its potential impact on the Company. 
 
 We may compete with other entities affiliated with our Adviser and our Sponsor for investments. 
 
 Neither our Adviser nor our Sponsor and their affiliates are prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any other business or from possessing interests in any other business ventures that compete with ours. Our Adviser, our Sponsor and their affiliates may provide financing to similarly situated investments. Our Adviser and our Sponsor may face conflicts of interest when evaluating investment opportunities for us, and these conflicts of interest may have a negative impact on our ability to make attractive investments. 
 
 Our Adviser, its affiliates and their respective affiliates, officers and employees face competing demands relating to their time, and this may cause our operating results to suffer. 
 
 Our Adviser, its affiliates and their respective affiliates, officers and employees are key personnel, general partners, sponsors, managers, owners and advisors of other investment programs, including affiliate-sponsored investment products and investment programs focused on real estate, some of which have investment objectives and legal and financial obligations similar to ours and may have other business interests as well. Because these persons have competing demands on their time and resources, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our business and these other activities. If this occurs, the returns on our investments may suffer. 
 
 Our Adviser and its affiliates will face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Adviser s compensation arrangements with us, including compensation which may be required to be paid to our Adviser if the Advisory Agreement is terminated, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interest of our shareholders. 
 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser or its affiliates are entitled to fees based on our Managed Assets. Because the Adviser s compensation is not directly based on our performance, our Adviser s interests are not wholly aligned with those of our shareholders. In that regard, our Adviser could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments that would entitle our Adviser to a higher fee. For example, because leverage other than accrued expenses incurred in the normal course of operations is included in the calculation of Managed Assets, our Adviser may have an incentive to utilize leverage more heavily than it otherwise would in order to increase its fees. 
 
 Our declaration of trust permits our Board to issue shares with terms that may subordinate the rights of our shareholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that could otherwise result in a premium price to our shareholders. 
 
 Our Board may issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest and may issue such other securities including preferred shares as it deems necessary, desirable or appropriate and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such preferred shares. Thus, our Board could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our other shares. The issuance of such preferred shares could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price to holders of our shares. 
 
 Our declaration of trust contains certain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent an acquisition of our securities or a change in control. 
 
 Certain provisions of our declaration of trust may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our shareholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares. 
 
 Under our declaration of trust, certain transactions require the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of our trustees followed by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75 of our shares of beneficial interest of each affected class or series outstanding, voting as separate classes or series (the Principal Shareholder Requirements ), when a Principal Shareholder (defined generally to mean any corporation, person or other entity which is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 5 or more of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest of all outstanding classes or series and includes any affiliate or associate, as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, of a Principal Shareholder) is a party to the transaction. These transactions include any: 
 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 merger or consolidation of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company with or into any Principal Shareholder; 
 
 issuance of any securities of the Company to any Principal Shareholder for cash (other than pursuant to any automatic dividend reinvestment plan); 
 
 sale, lease or exchange of all or any substantial part of the assets of the Company to any Principal Shareholder (except assets having an aggregate fair market value of less than 2 of the total assets of the Company, aggregating for the purpose of such computation all assets sold, leased or exchanged in any series of similar transactions within a twelve-month period); or 
 
 sale, lease or exchange to the Company or any subsidiary thereof, in exchange for securities of the Company, of any assets of any Principal Shareholder (except assets having an aggregate fair market value of less than 2 of the total assets of the Company, aggregating for the purposes of such computation all assets sold, leased or exchanged in any series of similar transactions within a twelve-month period). 
 
 The Principal Shareholder Requirements are not applicable if (i) 80 of our trustees approve by resolution a memorandum of understanding with the Principal Shareholder with respect to and substantially consistent with such transaction followed by, subject to a resolution of the trustees specifying a greater or lesser requirement with respect to the vote or quorum, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of beneficial interest present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at a meeting where the holders of a majority of our shares of beneficial interest entitled to vote on the matter are present in person or by proxy, or (ii) the transaction is with an entity of which a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of a stock normally entitled to vote in elections of directors is owned of record or beneficially by the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 
 With respect to mergers or consolidations with a corporation, association, trust or organization, other than a Principal Shareholder, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Company s property, including its good will, to other than a Principal Shareholder, our declaration of trust requires authorization by two-thirds of our trustees; provided that any merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity, or sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Company s property (measured at the time that such transaction was originally approved by two-thirds of the trustees) will require the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 75 of the shares of beneficial interest of each affected class or series outstanding, voting as separate classes or series, unless the transaction has been approved by 80 of the trustees, in which case, subject to a resolution of the trustees specifying a greater or a lesser requirement with respect to the vote or quorum, such transaction will require the affirmative vote of a majority our shares of beneficial interest present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at a meeting where the holders of a majority of our shares of beneficial interest entitled to vote on the matter are present in person or by proxy. 
 
 Risks Related to Our REIT Status and Other Tax Items 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. Our failure to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes would reduce the amount of funds we have available for distribution and limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. However, we cannot assure you that we will qualify and remain qualified as a REIT. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, regarding our organization and ownership, distributions of our income, the nature and diversification of our income and assets and other tests imposed by the Code. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. We believe we have been and are organized and qualify as a REIT, and we intend to operate in a manner that will permit us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT, or that we will remain qualified as a REIT in the future. 
 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distributions to our shareholders because: 
 
 we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the corporate tax rate; 
 
 we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 unless we are entitled to relief under certain U.S. federal income tax laws, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. 
 
 In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required to make distributions to our shareholders. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it would adversely affect the value of our securities. 
 
 Furthermore, we currently own and may acquire additional direct or indirect interests in one or more entities that will elect to be taxed as REITs under the Code (each, a Subsidiary REIT ). A Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to U.S. federal income tax and (ii) the Subsidiary REIT s failure to qualify could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus could impair our ability to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. 
 
 Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to you. 
 
 Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. In addition, our TRSs or any TRS we form will be subject to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes on their net income. State, local and non-U.S. income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding U.S. federal income tax laws. Any federal or state taxes we pay will reduce our cash available for distribution to you. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of other U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws on an investment in our stock. 
 
 To maintain our REIT qualification, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions, and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and value of our securities. 
 
 In order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. We will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85 of our ordinary income, (b) 95 of our capital gain net income and (c) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. To maintain our REIT qualification and avoid the payment of U.S. federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, we may be required to accrue interest and discount income on SFR mortgage loans, CMBS, and other types of debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market s perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, and our current and potential future earnings. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the value of our securities. Alternatively, we may make taxable in-kind distributions of our own shares, which may cause our shareholders to be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash they receive, or we may be required to withhold taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash our shareholders receive. 
 
 There is a lack of clear authority governing the characterization of our subordinated debt or preferred equity investments for REIT qualification purposes. 
 
 There is limited case law and administrative guidance addressing whether instruments similar to any mezzanine loans or preferred equity investments that we may acquire will be treated as equity or debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We typically do not anticipate obtaining private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service IRS or opinions of counsel on the characterization of those investments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully recharacterizes a mezzanine loan or preferred equity investment that we have treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be treated as owning the assets held by the partnership or limited liability company that issued the security and we would be treated as receiving our proportionate share of the 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 income of the entity. There can be no assurance that such an entity will not derive nonqualifying income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income test or earn income that could be subject to a 100 penalty tax. Alternatively, if the IRS successfully recharacterizes a mezzanine loan or preferred equity investment that we have treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then that investment may be treated as producing interest income that would be qualifying income for the 95 gross income test, but not for the 75 gross income test. If the IRS successfully challenges the classification of our mezzanine loans or preferred equity investments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no assurance can be provided that we will not fail to satisfy the 75 or 95 gross income test. 
 
 The taxable mortgage pool rules may increase the taxes that we or our shareholders may incur and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations. 
 
 Securitizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we could have excess inclusion income. Certain categories of stockholders, such as non-U.S. stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses, and certain tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to any such excess inclusion income. In addition, to the extent that our shares are owned by tax-exempt disqualified organizations, such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income, we may incur a tax at the corporate rate on a portion of any excess inclusion income. Moreover, we could face limitations in selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. These limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions. 
 
 Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 
 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities, stock in REITs and other qualifying real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of CMBS and debt instruments of publicly offered REITs. The remainder of our investments in securities (other than government securities, securities issued by a TRS and REIT qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the value of our assets (other than government securities, securities issued by a TRS and securities that are qualifying real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20 of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our Portfolio, or contribute to a TRS, otherwise attractive investments, and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the income or asset requirements for qualifying as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 
 If our OP failed to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT. 
 
 We believe that our OP will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to take that position for all income tax reporting positions. As a partnership, our OP generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, will be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, its share of our OP s income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of our OP or any other subsidiary partnership in which we own an interest as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating our OP or any other such subsidiary partnership as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including by reason of being classified as a publicly traded partnership, unless at least 90 of its income was qualifying income as defined in the Code, or a taxable mortgage pool for U.S. federal income tax purposes), we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT, unless we qualified for certain statutory savings provisions. A publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). Although our OP s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, the OP s units could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and our OP may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects. Our OP may not meet 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 this qualifying income test. Also, the failure of our OP or any subsidiary partnerships to qualify as a partnership could cause it to become subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including us. 
 
 Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. 
 
 Income from qualified dividends payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is generally subject to tax at reduced rates. Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20 . Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate. However, U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. To qualify for this deduction, the U.S. shareholder receiving such dividends must hold the dividend-paying REIT stock for at least 46 days (taking into account certain special holding period rules) of the 91-day period beginning 45 days before the stock becomes ex-dividend and cannot be under an obligation to make related payments with respect to a position in substantially similar or related property. Although this deduction reduces the effective U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could materially and adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including the per share trading price of our securities. In addition, certain U.S. stockholders may be subject to a 3.8 Medicare tax on dividends payable by REITs. 
 
 The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8 share ownership limits in our declaration of trust may inhibit market activity in our shares and restrict our business combination opportunities. 
 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50 in value of our issued and outstanding shares at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made. Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares under this requirement. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made. To help ensure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on the acquisition and ownership of our shares. 
 
 To assist us in complying with the limitations on the concentration of ownership of a REIT imposed by the Code, among other purposes, our declaration of trust, including the statement of preferences setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares, prohibits, with certain exceptions, any shareholder from beneficially or constructively owning, applying certain attribution rules under the Code, more than 9.8 by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of our outstanding common shares, or 9.8 by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of any class or series. 
 
 Our Board may, in its sole discretion, subject to such conditions as it may determine and the receipt of certain representations and undertakings, waive the 9.8 ownership limit with respect to a particular shareholder if such ownership will not then or in the future jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. Our Board granted James Dondero and his affiliates a waiver allowing him to own up to 25 of our common shares and Series A Preferred Shares, combined. Our declaration of trust also prohibits any person from, among other things, beneficially or constructively owning our shares that would result in our being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, beneficial ownership or constructive ownership that would result in us owning (actually or constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by us from such tenant would cause us to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code) or a domestically controlled qualified investment entity within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code. 
 
 Our declaration of trust provides that any ownership or purported transfer of our shares in violation of the foregoing restrictions will result in the shares so owned or transferred being automatically transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary, and the purported owner or transferee acquiring no rights in such shares. If a transfer of our shares would result in our shares being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons or the transfer to a charitable trust would be ineffective for any reason to prevent a violation of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares, the transfer resulting in such violation will be void ab initio. 
 
 The Board granted waivers from the ownership limits to James Dondero, his affiliates and others and may grant additional waivers in the future. These waivers may be subject to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 preserve our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our Board determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to so qualify as a REIT. 
 
 These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. 
 
 Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. 
 
 The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or to offset certain other positions, if properly identified under applicable Treasury regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a domestic TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses from hedges held in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS. 
 
 Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment. 
 
 For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of assets may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification. Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any asset (other than foreclosure property) that we own or hold an interest in, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary entity, including our OP, but generally excluding TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property. During such time as we qualify as a REIT, we intend to avoid the 100 prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS will incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own or hold an interest in, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (c) structuring certain dispositions to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code that, among other requirements, have been held for at least two years. No assurance can be given that any particular asset that we own or hold an interest in, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our OP, but generally excluding TRSs, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. 
 
 The 100 tax described above may limit our ability to enter into transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us. For example, if circumstances make it not profitable or otherwise uneconomical for us to remain in certain states or geographical markets, the 100 tax could delay our ability to exit those states or markets by selling our assets in those states or markets other than through a TRS, which could harm our operating profits. 
 
 We may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them. 
 
 We may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The amount of such discount will generally be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accrued market discount is reported as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal of the debt instrument is made, unless we elect to include accrued market discount in income as it accrues. Principal payments on certain loans are made monthly, and consequently accrued market discount may have to be included in income each month as if the debt instrument were assured of ultimately being collected in full. If we collect less on the debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions. 
 
 Similarly, some of the debt instruments that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. We will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such debt instruments will be made. If such debt instrument turns out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectibility is 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 provable. Finally, in the event that any debt instruments acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate debt instruments at their stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are ultimately collectable. In each case, while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter. 
 
 The interest apportionment rules under Treasury Regulation Section 1.856-5(c) provide that, if a mortgage is secured by both real property and other property, a REIT is required to apportion its annual interest income to the real property security based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the real property securing the loan, determined when the REIT commits to acquire the loan, and the denominator of which is the highest principal amount of the loan during the year. In IRS Revenue Procedure 2014-51, the IRS interprets the principal amount of the loan to be the face amount of the loan, despite the Code requiring taxpayers to treat any market discount, that is the difference between the purchase price of the loan and its face amount, for all purposes (other than certain withholding and information reporting purposes) as interest rather than principal. 
 
 If we invest in mortgage loans to which the interest apportionment rules described above would apply and the IRS were to assert successfully that our mortgage loans were secured by property other than real estate, the interest apportionment rules applied for purposes of our REIT testing, and that the position taken in IRS Revenue Procedure 2014-51 should be applied to our Portfolio, then depending upon the value of the real property securing our mortgage loans and their face amount, and the sources of our gross income generally, we may fail to meet the 75 gross income test. If we do not meet this test, we could potentially lose our REIT qualification or be required to pay a penalty to the IRS. 
 
 The sale of certain properties could result in significant tax liabilities unless we are able to defer the taxable gain through 1031 Exchanges. 
 
 We may structure asset sales for possible inclusion in 1031 Exchanges. The ability to complete a 1031 Exchange depends on many factors, including, among others, identifying and acquiring suitable replacement property within limited time periods, and the ownership structure of the properties being sold and acquired. Therefore, we are not always able to sell an asset as part of a 1031 Exchange. When successful, a 1031 Exchange enables us to defer the taxable gain on the asset sold. If we cannot defer the taxable gain resulting from the sales of certain properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, the market price per share of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 The ability of our Board to revoke our REIT qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders. 
 
 Our declaration of trust provides that our Board may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our shareholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders. 
 
 Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on our shareholders or us. 
 
 The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect our investors or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. Prospective investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the U.S. federal tax laws on an investment in our stock. 
 
 We and our subsidiaries and stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign tax filing and payment obligations taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside. 
 
 We may own assets located in, or transact business in, numerous jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or foreign tax treatment and that of our stockholders may not conform 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application and effect of state and local income and other tax laws on an investment in our stock. 
 
 Foreign investors may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon disposition of our common shares. 
 
 Subject to certain exceptions, distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such dividends paid to a non-U.S. stockholder ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30 rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 FIRPTA ), capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests USRPIs ), generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (1) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (2) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10 of the class of our stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the distribution is received. 
 
 Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common shares generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA. Our common shares will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a domestically-controlled REIT. A REIT is domestically controlled if less than 50 of the REIT s stock, by value, has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying U.S. persons during a continuous five-year period ending on the date of disposition or, if shorter, during the entire period of the REIT s existence. We cannot assure you that we will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. If we were to fail to so qualify, gain realized by foreign investors on a sale of shares of our stock would be subject to FIRPTA tax, unless the shares of our stock were traded on an established securities market and the foreign investor did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of the value of our outstanding common shares. 
 
 Our ownership of interests in TRSs raises certain tax risks. 
 
 A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a TRS. A TRS also includes any corporation other than a REIT with respect to which a TRS owns securities possessing more than 35 of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of such corporation. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to income tax as a C corporation. We currently own interests in multiple TRS entities and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. As of December 31, 2022, the Company wholly owned and consolidated two TRSs, NREO TRS, LLC and NHF TRS, LLC. 
 
 We will be required to pay a 100 tax on any redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, excess interest or redetermined TRS service income. In general, redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of services furnished to any of our tenants by a TRS of ours. Redetermined deductions and excess interest generally represent amounts that are deducted by a TRS of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm s-length negotiations. Redetermined TRS service income generally represents amounts by which the gross income of a TRS attributable to its services for or on behalf of us (other than to a tenant of ours) would be increased based on arm s length negotiations. 
 
 Our TRSs are and any TRS we acquire in the future will be subject to corporate income tax at the U.S. federal, state and local levels, (including on the gain realized from the sale of property held by it, as well as on income earned while such property is operated by the TRS). This tax obligation, if material, would diminish the amount of the proceeds from the sale or operation of such property, or other income earned through the TRS that would be distributable to our shareholders. U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax rates may be increased in the future, and any such increase would reduce the amount of the net proceeds available for distribution by us to our shareholders from the sale of property or other income earned through a TRS after the effective date of any increase in such tax rates. We anticipate income tax obligations in connection with our ownership of interests in TRSs for fiscal year 2022. 
 
 As a REIT, the value of our interests in our TRSs generally may not exceed 20 of the total value of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter. If the IRS were to determine that the value of our interests in all of our TRSs exceeded this limit at the end of any calendar quarter, then we would fail to qualify as a REIT. If we determine it to be in our best interest to own a substantial number of our properties through one or more TRSs, then it is possible that the IRS may conclude that the value of our interests in our TRSs exceeds 20 of the value of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter and therefore cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Additionally, as a REIT, no more than 25 of our gross income 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 with respect to any year may, in general, be from sources other than certain real estate-related assets. Dividends paid to us from a TRS are typically considered to be non-real estate income. Therefore, we may fail to qualify as a REIT if dividends from all of our TRSs, when aggregated with all other non-real estate income with respect to any one year, are more than 25 of our gross income with respect to such year. 
 
 Mortgage debt obligations associated with our real property investments expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt, as well as hinder our ability to meet REIT distribution requirements or trigger tax indemnification obligations. 
 
 Mortgage and other secured debt obligations increase our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default. Any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could adversely affect the overall value of our Portfolio of properties. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties that is subject to a nonrecourse mortgage loan would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. Foreclosures could also trigger tax indemnification obligations under the terms of any tax protection agreements with respect to the sales of properties subject to any such agreements. 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Shares 
 
 The concentration of our share ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. 
 
 James Dondero is the sole member of the general partner of our Sponsor and has relationships with certain holders of our common shares which may result in Mr. Dondero being deemed to have aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 6,567,756.66 common shares (or 17.7 of our common shares) and 45,986 of our Series A Preferred Shares (or 1.4 of our Series A Preferred Shares) as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The concentration of our share ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Mr. Dondero and his affiliates may exert substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our declaration of trust and approval of major corporate transactions, including the decision to enter into any corporate transaction. Such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business combination, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their common shares. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. 
 
 In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares beneficially held by Mr. Dondero, his affiliates and other entities with which he has relationships, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. This concentrated share ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our share price or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our share price. 
 
 Broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common shares. 
 
 The market price of our common shares may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common shares include: 
 
 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity, or changes in investment strategy or prospects; 
 
 changes in our operations or earnings estimates or publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; 
 
 loss of a major funding source or inability to obtain new favorable funding sources in the future; 
 
 our financing strategy and leverage;

 the extent of investor interest in our securities; 
 
 the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies; 
 
 our underlying asset value; 
 
 investor confidence and price and volume fluctuations in the stock and bond markets, generally; 
 
 changes in laws, regulatory policies or tax guidelines, or interpretations thereof, particularly with respect to REITs; 
 
 future equity issuances by us, or share resales by our shareholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur; 
 
 failure to meet income estimates; 
 
 failure to meet and maintain REIT qualifications or exclusion from Investment Company Act regulations or listing on the NYSE; and 
 
 general market and economic conditions. 
 
 In the past, class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and trading price of our common shares. 
 
 The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions on our common shares in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations. 
 
 The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions on our common shares will be declared at the discretion of our Board and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and other factors as our Board may consider relevant. Our Board may modify our dividend policy from time to time. 
 
 We may be unable to make distributions on our common shares at expected levels, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common shares. 
 
 If sufficient cash is not available for distribution from our operations, we may have to fund distributions on our common shares from working capital, borrow to provide funds for such distributions, reduce the amount of such distributions, or issue share dividends. To the extent we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. If cash available for distribution generated by our assets is less than we expect, our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common shares. 
 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 All distributions on our common shares will be made at the discretion of our Board and will be based upon, among other factors, our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other tax considerations, and other expense obligations, debt covenants, contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future, and our inability to make distributions, or to make distributions at expected levels, could result in a decrease in the market price of our common shares. 
 
 Future issuances of debt securities and equity securities may negatively affect the market price of our common shares and, in the case of equity securities, may be dilutive to owners of our common shares and could reduce the overall value of an investment in our common shares. 
 
 In the future, we may issue debt or equity securities or incur other financial obligations, including share dividends and shares that may be issued in exchange for common shares. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred shares will receive a distribution of our available assets before common shareholders. We are not required to offer any such additional debt or equity securities to shareholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional common shares issuances, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities (including common shares and convertible preferred shares), warrants or options, will dilute the holdings of our existing common shareholders and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our common shares. Any convertible preferred shares would have, and any series or class of our preferred shares would likely have, a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to common shareholders. 
 
 Holders of our common shares do not have preemptive rights to any shares we issue in the future. Our declaration of trust authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest. The statement of preferences of the Series A Preferred Shares designates a series of 4,800,000 preferred shares as Series A Preferred Shares, of which 3,359,593 are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022. In the future, our Board may elect to (1) sell additional shares in future public offerings; (2) issue equity interests in private offerings; (3) issue our common shares under a long-term incentive plan to our non-employee trustees or to employees of our Adviser or its affiliates; (4) issue shares to our Adviser, its successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation or as consideration in a related-party transaction; or (5) issue our common shares in connection with a redemption of Partnership Units of the OP. To the extent we issue additional equity interests in the future, the percentage ownership interest held by holders of our common shares will be diluted. Further, depending upon the terms of such transactions, most notably the offering price per share, holders of our common shares may also experience a dilution in the book value of their investment in us. 
 
 Common shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price. 
 
 We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common shares, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common shares. 
 
 Sales of substantial amounts of common shares or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common shares. 
 
 We may issue additional shares in future public offerings or private placements to make new investments or for other purposes. We are not required to offer any such shares to shareholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, it may not be possible for shareholders to participate in such future share issuances, which may dilute such shareholders interests in us. 
 
 The rights of our common shareholders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Shares and these rights may have a negative effect on the value of our common shares. 
 
 The holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Shares have rights and preferences generally senior to those of the holders of our common shares. The existence of these senior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of our common shares. These rights are more fully set forth in the statement of preferences setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred shares, and include, but are not limited to the right to receive a liquidation preference, prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common shares. In addition, the Series A Preferred Shares rank senior to our common shares with respect to priority of such dividend payments, which may limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our common shares. 
 
 Risks Related to the Ownership of the Series A Preferred Shares 
 
 The market price and trading volume of the Series A Preferred Shares may fluctuate significantly and be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control. 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 The Series A Preferred Shares are listed on the NYSE, but there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be maintained on the NYSE. Further, the Series A Preferred Shares may trade at prices lower than the public offering price, and the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares depends on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 prevailing interest rates; 
 
 the market for similar securities; 
 
 general economic and financial market conditions; 
 
 our issuance, as well as the issuance by our subsidiaries, of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and 
 
 our financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations, funds from operations and prospects. 
 
 The trading prices of common and preferred equity securities issued by REITs and other real estate companies historically have been affected by changes in interest rates. One of the factors that may influence the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares is the annual yield from distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares as compared to yields on other financial instruments. An increase in interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of the Series A Preferred Shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could reduce the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares. 
 
 Future offerings of debt securities or our shares, including future offerings of traded or non-traded preferred shares, expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares. 
 
 Our cash available for distribution may not be sufficient to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares at expected levels, and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future. We may use borrowed funds or funds from other sources to pay dividends, which may adversely impact our operations. 
 
 We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our preferred shareholders. Distributions declared by us will be authorized by our Board in its sole discretion out of assets legally available for distribution and will depend upon a number of factors, including our earnings, our financial condition, the requirements for qualification as a REIT, restrictions under applicable law, our need to comply with the terms of our existing financing arrangements, our capital requirements and other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. We may have to fund distributions from working capital, borrow to provide funds for such distributions, use proceeds of future offerings or sell assets to the extent distributions exceed earnings or cash flows from operations. Funding distributions from working capital would restrict our operations. If we are required to sell assets to fund dividends, such asset sales may occur at a time or in a manner that is not consistent with our disposition strategy. If we borrow to fund dividends, our leverage ratios and future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. We may not be able to pay dividends in the future. In addition, some of our distributions may be considered a return of capital for income tax purposes. If we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder s adjusted tax basis in their shares. A return of capital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing the holder s adjusted tax basis in its investment. If distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder s shares, they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares. 
 
 The Series A Preferred Shares are subordinate to our existing and future debt, and such interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock and by other transactions. 
 
 The Series A Preferred Shares rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, any classes and series of our shares of beneficial interest expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Our declaration of trust gives our Board the authority to authorize and issue such securities as they determine to be necessary desirable or appropriate, and the Board has authorized the issuance of up to 4,800,000 Series A Preferred Shares. Subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our declaration of trust and the statement of preferences setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares, our Board is authorized to issue preferred shares in such classes or series as our Board may determine and to establish from time to time the number of preferred shares to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Shares or additional shares of our beneficial interest ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, would dilute the interests of the holders of Series A Preferred Shares, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our shares of beneficial interest expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Shares. Other than the right to vote on matters which are submitted to a vote of our common shareholders, none of the provisions relating to the Series A Preferred Shares contain any terms relating to or limiting our indebtedness or affording the holders of Series A Preferred Shares protection in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including a merger or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets, that might adversely affect the holders of Series A Preferred Shares. 
 
 The Series A Preferred Shares are not rated and may not be rated in the future. 
 
 The Series A Preferred Shares were previously rated by Egan-Jones Rating Company ("Egan-Jones") and are not currently rated. We do not currently intend to seek or maintain a rating for our Series A Preferred Shares. No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares. In addition, we may elect in the future to again obtain a rating of the Series A Preferred Shares, which could adversely impact the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares. 
 
 Future offerings of debt securities or of our shares expressly designated as ranking senior to our Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up may adversely affect the market price of our Series A Preferred Shares. 
 
 If we decide to issue debt securities or additional shares, including traded or non-traded preferred shares, expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up in the future, it is possible that those securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable debt securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series A Preferred Shares and may result in dilution to owners of the Series A Preferred Shares. We and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt securities or shares expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of the Series A Preferred Shares will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares and diluting the value of their share holdings in us. 
 
 General Risks 
 
 We are highly dependent on information technology and security breaches or systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to pay dividends. 
 
 Our business is highly dependent on information technology. In the ordinary course of our business, we may store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our business partners, on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, disrupt our trading activities, or damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. 
 
 The resources required to protect our information technology and infrastructure, and to comply with the laws and regulations related to data and privacy protection, are subject to uncertainty. Even in circumstances where we are able to successfully protect such technology and infrastructure from attacks, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to such attacks. In addition, recent well-publicized security breaches have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-security attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cyber-security requirements and/or additional regulatory oversight. As cyber-security threats and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security measures we currently maintain. Any such actions may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

 Furthermore, if some of our or our Adviser s employees are required to work remotely in the future due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or infectious diseases, or if we or our Adviser allow permanent or significant remote work by any of our or its employees, there may be an increased risk of disruption to our operations because they may be utilizing residential networks and infrastructure which may not be as secure as in our office environment. 
 
 The current COVID-19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and other pandemics in the future could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak evolved rapidly and continues to evolve. Additionally, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 are unpredictable and current vaccines and treatments may not be effective against new variants. 
 
 As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted, and the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or infectious diseases in the future could negatively impact, almost every industry directly or indirectly, which may adversely impact our performance or the ability of underlying real estate collateral relating to our investments, increase the default risk applicable to borrowers and making it relatively more difficult for us to generate attractive risk adjusted returns. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, and other future pandemics, could also materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance due to, among other factors: 
 
 reduced economic activity may cause certain borrowers underlying our real estate related assets and senior loans to become delinquent or default on their loans, or seek to defer payment on, or refinance, their loans; 
 
 reduced economic activity could result in a prolonged recession, which could negatively impact the value of commercial and residential real estate, which further negatively impacts the value of our investments, potentially materially; 
 
 difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, impacts to our credit ratings, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis, or at all; 
 
 the financial impact of the COVID-19 or a future pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants in our debt obligations and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness; 
 
 uncertainties created by the COVID-19 or a future pandemic could make it difficult to estimate provisions for loan losses; 
 
 a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate and real estate related transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to make new investments or to redeploy the proceeds from repayments of our existing investments; 
 
 the potential negative impact on the health of the employees of our Adviser, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during this disruption; and 
 
 the timing of the development and distribution of effective treatments for COVID-19 and future pandemics. 
 
 We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business. 
 
 The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in this annual report should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Our business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the price of our securities, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 
 The direct and indirect impacts of climate change may adversely affect our business. 
 
 We may be adversely impacted by the direct consequences of climate change, such as property damage due to increases in the frequency, duration and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods. Increases in property damage due to these events may contribute to increases in costs in property insurance. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in delays and increased capital expenditures on our existing properties (for example, to improve their energy efficiency and/or resistance to inclement weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, and, as a result, adversely impact our financial results and operations.

 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this report. 
 
 Overview 
 As of December 31, 2022, our Portfolio consisted primarily of debt and equity investments in the single-family rental, self-storage, office, hospitality, life science and multifamily sectors. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. The OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP and is owned 100 by the Company. As of December 31, 2022, there were 2,000 OP Units outstanding, of which 100 , were owned by us. 
 On July 1, 2022, or the Deregistration Date, the SEC issued the Deregistration Order pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act declaring that the Company has ceased to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The issuance of the Deregistration Order enables the Company to proceed with full implementation of its new business mandate to operate as a diversified REIT that focuses primarily on investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to equity, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity (the Business Change ). As a result of the Business Change, we have not provided a comparison of our financial statements to prior periods in which we were operating as a registered investment company because it would not be useful to our shareholders. The discussion herein is principally limited to our financial condition and results of operations during the period from the Deregistration Date to December 31, 2022. 
 As a diversified REIT, the Company s primary investment objective is to provide both current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve this objective through the Business Change. Target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, single-family rentals, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. The Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities. We are externally managed by the Adviser through the Advisory Agreement, by and among the Company and the Adviser. The Advisory Agreement was dated July 1, 2022, and amended on October 25, 2022, for an initial three-year 
 58

 term that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. The Adviser is wholly owned by our Sponsor. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through one or more TRS entities and are subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. 
 On October 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit was filed by a litigation subtrust formed in connection with the Highland Bankruptcy against various persons and entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. In addition, on February 8, 2023, the UBS Lawsuit was filed against Mr. Dondero and a number of other persons and entities. Neither the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit nor the UBS Lawsuit include claims related to our business or our assets. Our Sponsor and Mr. Dondero have informed us they believe the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit has no merit, and Mr. Dondero has informed us he believes the UBS Lawsuit has no merit; we have been advised that the defendants named in each of the lawsuits intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We do not expect the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit or the UBS Lawsuit will have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Macroeconomic trends, including increases in inflation and rising interest rates, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflation in the United States has recently accelerated and is currently expected to continue at an elevated level in the near-term. Rising inflation could have an adverse impact on our operating expenses and our floating rate mortgages and credit facilities, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental and other revenue. There is no guarantee we will be able to mitigate the impact of rising inflation. The Federal Reserve has recently started raising interest rates to combat inflation and restore price stability and it is expected that rates will continue to rise. In addition, to the extent our exposure to increases in interest rates on any of our debt is not eliminated through interest rate swaps and interest rate protection agreements, such increases will result in higher debt service costs which will adversely affect our cash flows. We cannot make assurances that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. Such future constraints could increase our borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments, which could slow or deter future growth. 
 
 Components of Our Revenues and Expenses 
 Revenues 
 Rental income . Our rental income is primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our investment in Cityplace Tower, a 42-story, 1.35 million-square-foot, trophy office building acquired in 2018 as well as rental income from two retail properties (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). Our rental income also includes utility reimbursements, late fees, common area maintenance reimbursements, and other rental fees charged to tenants. 
 Interest income. Interest income includes interest earned from our debt investments. 
 Dividend income. Dividend income includes dividends from our equity investments. 
 Other income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as non-refundable fees, parking fees, and other miscellaneous fees charged to tenants and income items. 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities, casualty-related expenses and recoveries and other property operating costs of property owned directly or indirectly by us. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 Property management fees. Property management fees include fees paid to NexVest, our property manager, for managing each property directly or indirectly owned by us (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements). 
 Real estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property owned directly or indirectly by us. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property owned directly or indirectly by us. 
 Advisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements). 
 Property general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property owned directly or indirectly by us. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of trustee fees, investor relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Adviser for operating expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses and the Advisory Fees and Administrative Fees paid to our Adviser will not exceed the Expense Cap for the 12 months subsequent to the Deregistration Date, calculated in accordance with the Advisory Agreement. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by us of expenses related to securities offerings paid by our Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation, or other events outside our ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets. Additionally, in the sole discretion of the Adviser, the Adviser may elect to waive reimbursement for eligible out-of-pocket expenses paid on the Company s behalf. Once waived, such expenses are considered permanently waived and become non-recoupable in the future. 
 Conversion expense . In connection with the Deregistration Order, the Company has incurred legal fees and other fees in preparation for the Business Change. These conversion expenses are included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as conversion expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our real properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases on property owned directly or indirectly by us. 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs, if any, and the related impact of interest rate derivatives, if any, used to manage our interest rate risk. 
 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures . Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures represents the change in our basis in equity method investments resulting from our share of the investments income and expenses. Profit and loss from equity method investments for which we ve elected the fair value option are classified in divided income, change in unrealized gains and realized gains as applicable. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense is primarily derived from taxable gains from asset sales and other income earned from investments held in our TRSs. 
 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments . Unrealized gains and losses represent changes in fair value for equity method investments, CLO equity investments, bonds, common stock, convertible notes, LLC interests, LP interests, rights and warrants, and senior loans for which the fair value option has been elected. 
 Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments. The Company recognizes the excess, or deficiency, of net proceeds received, less the carrying value of such investments, as realized gains or losses, respectively. The Company reverses cumulative, unrealized gains or losses previously reported in its Consolidated Statements of Operations on both the Successor and Predecessor basis with respect to the investment sold at the time of the sale.

 Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 
 The six months ended December 31, 2022 
 As a result of the Business Change, we have not provided a comparison of our financial statements to prior periods in which we were operating as a registered investment company because it would not be useful to our shareholders. The discussion herein is principally limited to our financial condition and results of operations during the period from the Deregistration Date to December 31, 2022. 
 The following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 
 For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Total revenues 55,130 Total expenses (24,358) Operating income 30,772 Interest expense (5,759) Equity in losses of unconsolidated ventures (2,257) Income tax expense (9,975) Change in unrealized losses (92,031) Realized loss (2,323) Net loss (81,573) Net income attributable to preferred shareholders (2,310) Net loss attributable to common shareholders (83,883) 
 The net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 primarily relates to mark-to-market losses on our investments accounted for at fair value partially offset by interest and dividends. 
 Revenues 
 Rental income . Rental income was 10.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Rental income primarily consists of lease revenue from our investment in Cityplace Tower. 
 Interest and dividends . Interest and dividends totaled 45.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Interest and dividends consists primarily of dividends from CLO equity investments of 29.1 million, NREF OP distributions of 7.0 million and VineBrook Homes Operating Partnership, L.P. ("VB OP") distributions of 2.8 million. 
 Other income. Other income was approximately 32,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses were 3.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Property operating expenses consist primarily of expenses from our investment in Cityplace Tower. 
 Property management fees. Property management fees were 0.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Property management fees are primarily based on gross revenues derived primarily from our investment in Cityplace Tower. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were 2.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Real estate taxes and insurance expenses consist primarily of expenses from our investment in Cityplace Tower.

 Advisory and administrative fees. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred Administrative Fees and Advisory Fees of 5.5 million, inclusive of 1.8 million in expenses that were deferred to comply with the Expense Cap. Should the Company s Fees and expenses subject to the Expense Cap be less than the 1.5 limit for the twelve month period subsequent to the Deregistration Date, some or all of the deferred expenses could be recouped by the Adviser up to the Expense Cap. 
 Property general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were 0.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Property general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses from our investment in Cityplace Tower. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were 3.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Corporate general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by legal fees 0.8 million. 
 Conversion expenses. Conversion expenses were 1.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Conversion fees were primarily driven by legal fees related to the Deregistration Order of 0.9 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were 7.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of expenses from our investment in Cityplace Tower. Due to the Business Change, the fair value of our real estate properties as of July 1, 2022 became the new cost basis for the Company. This change reset the depreciable basis of our properties as well as caused the recognition of new intangible lease assets. 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 5.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Equity in losses of unconsolidated ventures . Equity in losses of unconsolidated ventures was 2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and was primarily driven by amortization of the basis difference on the SAFStor Ventures of approximately 2.2 million. 
 Income tax expense . The Company has recorded a current income tax expense of 10.7 million associated with the TRSs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, which is largely driven by income from the Company s legacy CLO investments. The tax expense is partially offset by removing the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset of 2.2 million and increased by a 2021 return-to-provision adjustment of 1.5 million for a net expense of 10.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, that is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Change in unrealized losses . Unrealized losses from our investments accounted for at fair value was 92.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Losses were primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on NREF OP Units of 21.3 million, mark-to-market losses on NSP OC Common Units and equity of 23.6 million and losses on our CLO equity portfolio of 27.9 million. Our CLO equity portfolio consists primarily of CLOs that are in the process of winding down operations and liquidating their remaining holdings. The losses on the CLO equity portfolio are offset by dividends received of 29.1 million which are shown in interest and dividends on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Realized gains (losses) . Realized losses were 2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily by a realized loss of 6.9 million on the contribution of the SAFStor Ventures to the NSP OC as discussed in Note 14 of the Company's consolidated financial statements. This was partially offset by gains on maturities in our life settlement portfolio of 3.5 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for debt maturities, operating expenses and other expenditures including: 
 capital expenditures to continue the ongoing development of Cityplace Tower; 
 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see Obligations and Commitments below); 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our properties; 
 distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; 
 income taxes for taxable income generated by TRS entities; 
 acquisition of additional properties or investments; 
 advisory and administrative fees payable to our Adviser; 
 general and administrative expenses; 
 reimbursements to our Adviser; and 
 property management fees. 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2022, we had 13.4 million of cash available to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we also had 35.3 million of restricted cash held in reserve by the lender on the Cityplace debt. These reserves include escrows for property taxes and insurance, reserves for tenant improvements as well as required excess collateral. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional properties, make additional accretive investments pursuant to our investment strategy, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings, and property and non-real estate asset dispositions. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity, market perceptions about us and restrictions on sales of properties under the Code. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources. 
 In addition to our ongoing renovation of Cityplace, our other properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. We estimate an additional 190 million to 210 million of capital expenditures to complete the Cityplace renovation. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments, or expansions of our properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2022.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 
 For the Six Months Ended December 31 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities 31,431 Net cash used in investing activities (14,418) Net cash used in financing activities (19,140) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (2,127) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 50,776 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 48,649 
 Cash flows from operating activities. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was 31.4 million. Operating cash flows were primarily driven by dividends received from our CLO equity portfolio. 
 Cash flows from investing activities. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was 14.4 million. Cash flows from investing activities was primarily driven by acquisitions of new real estate investments of 26.5 million partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of our Caddo Sustainable Timberlands investment of 10.9 million in cash. 
 Cash flows from financing activities. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was 19.1 million. Cash flows from financing activities was primarily driven by borrowings of 9.5 million, offset by credit facility repayments of 12.5 million, prime brokerage repayments of 14.4 million and dividends paid to common shareholders of 11.2 million. 
 
 Debt 
 Mortgage Debt 
 As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated subsidiaries had aggregate mortgage debt outstanding to third parties of approximately 144.7 million at a weighted average interest rate of 7.3 . See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We intend to invest in additional real estate investments as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common shares or other securities or investment and property dispositions. 
 Although we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common shares or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. 
 Furthermore, following the completion of our renovation and development programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.

 Credit Facility 
 On January 8, 2021, the Company entered into a 30.0 million credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and drew the full balance. As of December 31, 2022, the Credit Facility, as amended, bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.5 and matures on November 6, 2023. On March 6, 2023, the interest rate on the Credit Facility increased to one-month LIBOR plus 4.25 . The Company paid down 9.0 million on the Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid down 5.0 million on the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, the Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of 11.0 million. For additional information regarding our Credit Facility, see Note 7. 
 
 Obligations and Commitments 
 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022 for the next five calendar years subsequent to December 31, 2022. 
 Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Property Level Debt Principal payments 157,918 144,668 13,250 Interest expense 5,846 4,517 830 499 Total 163,764 149,185 830 13,749 Prime Brokerage Borrowing Principal payments 2,624 2,624 (1) Interest expense 481 96 97 96 96 96 (1) Total 3,105 96 97 96 96 96 2,624 Preferred Shares Dividend payments 9,240 9,240 9,240 9,240 9,240 N/A (2) Credit Facility Principal payments 11,000 11,000 Interest expense 120 120 Total 11,120 11,120 Total contractual obligations and commitments 177,989 169,641 10,167 23,085 9,336 9,336 2,624

 (2) The Series A Preferred Shares are perpetual. 
 Credit Facility 
 The Credit Facility will mature on November 6, 2023 and is subject to monthly amortization payments through the maturity date. We believe we will have adequate liquidity to pay these obligations when they come due.

Table of Contents 

 Cityplace Debt 
 On November 8, 2022, we received lender consent to defer the maturity of the Cityplace debt to February 8, 2023. On February 8, 2023, the lenders agreed to defer the maturity of the debt by three months to May 8, 2023 with the possibility to extend for an additional four months to September 8, 2023 provided certain metrics are met. The purpose of the deferral was to allow for continued discussions around refinancing the debt. Management recognizes that finding an alternative source of funding is necessary to repay the debt by the maturity date. Management believes that there is sufficient time before the maturity date and that the Company has sufficient access to capital to ensure the Company is able to meet its obligations as they become due. 
 Advisory Agreement 
 As consideration for the Adviser s services under the Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser the Fees, which includes the Advisory Fee equal to 1.00 of Managed Assets and the Administrative Fee equal to 0.20 of the Company s Managed Assets. The Advisory Agreement provides that the first portion of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee shall be paid in cash up to 1.0 million and the remainder of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee, if any, shall be paid in common shares of the Company, subject to certain restrictions. For additional information, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. The Advisory Agreement also provides that the Administrative Fee shall be paid in cash. 
 We also generally reimburse our Adviser for operating or offering expenses it incurs on our behalf or in connection with the services it performs for us. Direct payment of operating expenses by us together with reimbursement of operating expenses to the Adviser, plus compensation expenses relating to equity awards granted under a long-term incentive plan and all other corporate general and administrative expenses of the Company, including the Fees payable under the Advisory Agreement, may not exceed the Expense Cap of 1.5 of Managed Assets, calculated as of the end of each quarter, for the twelve-month period following the Company s receipt of the Deregistration Order; provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions or other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate-related investments; provided, further, in the event the Company consolidates another entity that it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such entity or otherwise, expenses will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such entity s expenses will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of expenses. The Adviser may, at its discretion and at any time, waive its right to reimbursement for eligible out-of-pocket expenses paid on the Company s behalf. Once waived, these expenses are considered permanently waived and become non-recoupable in the future. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 We anticipate that we will continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. However, we can give no assurance that we will maintain REIT qualification. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income , as defined by the Code, to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. The Company has recorded an income tax expense of 2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which is largely driven by income from the Company's legacy CLO investments. The Company has recorded a current income tax expense of 10.7 million associated with the TRSs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, which is largely driven by income from the Company s legacy CLO investments. The tax expense is partially offset by removing the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset of 2.2 million and increased by a 2021 return-to-provision adjustment of 1.5 million, for a net expense of 10.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, that is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income (loss) and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. As of December 31, 2022, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable REIT requirements. 
 We evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. As of December 31, 2022 and to our knowledge, we have no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time. 
 We recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 We had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 13, 2022. We and our subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which our subsidiaries and we are subject. When applicable, we recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Dividends 
 We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common shares. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common shares out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities. 
 We will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, investments held through our TRSs, book/tax differences on income derived from partnerships, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our tenth dividend of 2022 on our common shares of 0.15 per share which was paid on December 30, 2022 to shareholders of record on December 15, 2022. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2022 on our Series A Preferred Shares of 0.34375 per share which was sent to the transfer agent prior to December 31, 2022 and paid on January 3, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 23, 2022. Starting October 1, 2022, we expect that dividends on our common shares, when, if and as declared by our Board, will be declared on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had the following off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 Commitments 
 The Company is the guarantor on three secured loans to, and dividend payments with respect to Series D Preferred Stock of NSP, an affiliate of the Adviser, with the secured loans having an aggregate principal amount of approximately 662.1 million outstanding as of December 31, 2022. NSP is current on all debt and dividend payments and in compliance with all debt compliance provisions. See Note 14 for additional information. 
 The Company is a limited guarantor and an indemnitor on one of NHT's loans with an aggregate principal amount of 77.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The obligations include a customary environmental indemnity and a so-called "bad boy" guarantee, which is generally only applicable if and when the borrower directly, or indirectly through an agreement with an affiliate, joint venture partner or other third party, voluntarily files a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action or takes other actions that are fraudulent or improper. NHT is current on all debt payments and in compliance with all debt compliance provisions. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for further discussion of our accounting estimates and policies. 
 Valuation of Level 3 Fair Valued Investments 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 56.3 of the total assets owned by the Company are comprised of fair valued level 3 investments. The Company elected the fair-value option in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 825-10-10. On an annual basis, the Company hires independent third-party valuation firms to provide updated fair values for subsequent measurement absent a readily available market price. The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques. See Note 10, Fair Value of Derivatives and Financial Instruments , for further discussion of our valuation techniques of level 3 investments. The necessary inputs for these valuations includes a variety of valuation techniques and unobservable inputs. These inputs are subject to assumptions and estimates. As a result, the determination of fair value is uncertain because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are unobservable. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the unrealized loss related to the change in fair value of level 3 investments is 58.8 million. See Notes 10 for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of level 3 fair valued investments. 
 Purchase Price Allocation 
 Upon acquisition of a property considered to be an asset acquisition, the purchase price and related acquisition costs total consideration are allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets based on relative fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 805. 
 The allocation of total consideration, which is determined using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC 820 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements), is based on management s estimate of the property s as-if vacant fair value and is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. If any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value, which is estimated using inputs that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt assumed.

 Impairment 
 Real estate assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The key inputs into our impairment analysis include, but are not limited to, the holding period, net operating income, and capitalization rates. In such cases, we will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value. The Company s impairment analysis identifies and evaluates events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of a real estate investment may not be recoverable, including determining the period the Company will hold the rental property, net operating income, and the estimated capitalization rate for each respective real estate investment. 
 
 Inflation 
 The real estate market has not been directly affected by inflation in the past several years due to increases in rents nationwide. Our lease terms are generally for a period of one year or more and rental rates reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. 
 
 Inflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. The Federal Reserve has recently started raising interest rates to combat inflation and restore price stability and is expected to continue to raising interest rates in response to or in anticipation of continued inflation concerns. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges. 
 
 REIT Tax Election 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Code, to our shareholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities are managed through one or more TRS entities and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. The Company has recorded a current income tax expense of 2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 10.7 million associated with the TRSs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, which is largely driven by income from the Company s legacy CLO investments. The tax expense is partially offset by removing the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset of 2.2 million and increased by a 2021 return-to-provision adjustment of 1.5 million for a net expense of 12.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, that is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 (successor basis), the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for the six month period ended December 31, 2022 (successor basis). We have also audited the statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the six month period ended June 30, 2022 (predecessor basis), and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the six month periods ended December 31, 2022 (successor basis) and June 30, 2022 (predecessor basis), in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company discontinued the application of investment company accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies as of July 1, 2022 due to its deregistration as an investment company, and prospectively applied other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for companies which are not investment companies. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Fair value measurement of level 3 investments 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the Company s deregistration as an investment company on July 1, 2022, certain of the Company s investments were recorded at fair value using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Establishing fair values for these level 3 investments is inherently subjective and dependent upon significant unobservable inputs and assumptions. 
 We identified the evaluation of fair value measurements for certain level 3 investments as of July 1, 2022, as a critical audit matter. Evaluation of the Company s valuation assumptions for these level 3 investments involved a high degree of auditor judgment. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the capitalization rates, discount rates, and market rent. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the level 3 investments. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of an internal control related to the significant assumptions of the capitalization rates, discount rates, and market rent. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: 
 Evaluating the Company s capitalization rates and discount rates, by comparing them against a range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities. 
 Assessing the appropriateness of the market rent assumption by comparing it to independently researched transactions and current listings of comparable properties.

 OP Units outstanding, of which were owned by the Company. 
 On July 1, 2022 (the Deregistration Date ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act declaring that the Company has ceased to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act (the Deregistration Order ). The issuance of the Deregistration Order enables the Company to proceed with full implementation of its new business mandate to operate as a diversified REIT that focuses primarily on investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to equity, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity (the Business Change ). 
 The Company is externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors X, L.P. (the Adviser ), through an agreement dated July 1, 2022, amended on October 25, 2022, (the Advisory Agreement ), by and among the Company and the Adviser for an initial three-year term that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. The Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of the Company and provides investment management services. The Company had no employees as of December 31, 2022. All of the Company s investment decisions are made by the Adviser, subject to general oversight by the Adviser s investment committee and our board of trustees (the Board ). The Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (the Sponsor or NexPoint ). 
 As a diversified REIT, the Company s primary investment objective is to provide both current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve this objective through the Business Change. Target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, single-family rentals, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. The Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities.

 Basis". As a result of these changes, our consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended December 31, 2022, are accounted for using the Successor Basis and are presented separately from our consolidated financial statements on the Predecessor Basis, as of and for the periods prior to the Deregistration Date. The fair value of the Company s investments and consolidated operating properties as of the Deregistration Date became the new basis in accordance with FASB ASC 946. Due to this change, the Company reallocated these fair values to the assets and liabilities of operating properties. 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and million associated with the TRSs for the six months ended December 31, 2022, which is largely driven by income from the Company s legacy CLO investments. The tax expense is partially offset by removing the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset of million and increased by a 2021 return-to-provision adjustment of million for a net expense of million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, that is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 The Company evaluates the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The Company s management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. As of December 31, 2022 and to the knowledge of the Company, the Company has no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time. 
 The Company recognizes its tax positions and evaluates them using a two-step process. First, the Company determines whether a tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, the Company will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 The Company had material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2022. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject. When applicable, the Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company has not recorded any uncertain tax positions for the six months ended June 30, 2022 or six months ended December 31, 2022.

 The Company may not offset tax assets or liabilities from one TRS with those of another TRS. NHF TRS, LLC, one of the Company's TRSs, is estimated to generate a net taxable capital gain of million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The Company believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to harvest capital losses within this TRS during the three succeeding taxable years to be eligible for a capital loss carryback refund claim and has therefore not applied a valuation allowance to the extent of the expected future refund claim. As such, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of million against the Company s gross deferred tax assets to arrive at a net DTA of 3.4 million to reflect the expected tax benefit associated with the unrealized tax losses at this TRS. NREO TRS, LLC ("NREO TRS"), one of the Company's TRSs, has an estimated net operating loss balance of million as of December 31, 2022 that does not have an expiration date as well as an estimated million capital loss balance as of December 31, 2022, that will expire if not utilized within the succeeding five taxable years. The Company believes that it will be able to fully utilize the tax assets from NREO TRS and has not therefore applied a valuation allowance to the million DTA generated by this TRS.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of December 31, 2022, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our President and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an assessment regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment under the criteria described above, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 8

In the event that all of the Series A Preferred Shares then Outstanding are required to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph 6(b) of Part II hereof, the Trust shall redeem such shares at the Redemption Price and proceed to do so as set forth in paragraph 4(c) hereof. Effective immediately upon issuance of the Deregistration Order, this paragraph 4(a)(i) shall be void and shall have no further effect. 
 
 (b) Optional Redemptions.

 (ii) If the Trust shall give a Notice of Redemption, then by the close of business on the Business Day preceding the redemption date specified in the Notice of Redemption (so long as any conditions precedent to such redemption have been met) or, if the Dividend Disbursing Agent so agrees, another date not later than the redemption date, the Trust 
 9

Subject to paragraph 5(b) of Part II hereof, the holders of the outstanding capital shares of the Trust, including the holders of the Outstanding Preferred Shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, voting as a single class, shall elect the balance of the trustees. 
 
 (b) Additional Voting Rights for Trustees 
 
 (i) Right to Elect Majority of Board of Trustees . For so long as, and only for so long as, the Trust is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act and such entitlement shall cease immediately upon the issuance of the Deregistration Order, during any period in which any one or more of the conditions described below shall exist (such period being referred to herein as a 1940 Act Voting Period ), the number and or composition of trustees constituting the Board of Trustees shall be automatically adjusted as necessary to permit the holders of Outstanding Preferred Shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, voting separately as one class (to the exclusion of the holders of all other securities and classes of capital shares of the Trust) to elect the number of trustees that, when added to the 2 trustees elected exclusively by the holders of Preferred Shares pursuant to paragraph 5(a) above, would constitute a simple majority of the Board of Trustees as so adjusted. The Trust and the Board of Trustees shall take all necessary actions, including effecting the removal of trustees or amendment of the Declaration, to effect an adjustment of the number and or composition of trustees as described in the preceding sentence. A 1940 Act Voting Period shall commence 
 
 (A) if at any time accumulated dividends and distributions (whether or not earned or declared, and whether or not funds are then legally available in an amount sufficient therefor) on the Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares equal to at least 2 full years dividends and distributions shall be due and unpaid and sufficient Deposit Assets shall not have been deposited with the Dividend Disbursing Agent for the payment of such accumulated dividends and distributions or 
 
 (B) if at any time holders of any other Preferred Shares are entitled to elect a majority of the trustees of the Trust under the 1940 Act or Statement of Preferences creating such shares. 
 
 Effective immediately upon issuance of the Deregistration Order, this paragraph 5(b)(i) shall be void and shall have no further effect. 
 
 11 

(ii) Post-Deregistration Order Arrearages Trustee Voting Rights . This paragraph 5(b)(ii) shall not be applicable, and shall have no effect, until the issuance of the Deregistration Order and, thereafter, shall confer the voting entitlement described herein only for so long as the rules of a national securities exchange on which any of the Trust s equity securities are listed requires holders of Series A Preferred Shares to have such voting entitlements. During any period in which accumulated dividends and distributions (whether or not earned or declared, and whether or not funds are then legally available in an amount sufficient therefor) on the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares equal to at least six full quarters' dividends and distributions shall be due and unpaid and sufficient Deposit Assets shall not have been deposited with the Dividend Disbursing Agent for the payment of such accumulated dividends and distributions (such period being referred to herein as a Post-Deregistration Voting Period and, together with a 1940 Act Voting Period, a Voting Period ), holders of the Series A Preferred Shares, voting separately as one class (to the exclusion of the holders of all other securities and classes of capital shares of the Trust, except for any other series of Preferred Shares for which a like voting entitlement has arisen, with which the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares will vote together as one class for this purpose), shall be entitled to elect 2 of the Trust s trustees. The Trust and the Board of Trustees shall take all necessary actions, including effecting the removal of trustees or amendment of the Declaration, to effect an adjustment of the number and or composition of trustees as described in the preceding sentence. 
 
 Upon the termination of a Voting Period, the voting rights described in this paragraph 5(b) shall cease, subject always, however, to the reverting of such voting rights in the holders of Preferred Shares upon the further occurrence of any of the events described in this paragraph 5(b). 
 
 (c) Right to Vote with Respect to Certain Other Matters. Subject to paragraph 1 of Part III of this Statement of Preferences, so long as any Series A Preferred Shares are Outstanding, the Trust shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two- thirds of the Preferred Shares Outstanding at the time, voting separately as one class, amend, alter or repeal the provisions of this Statement of Preferences so as to in the aggregate adversely affect the rights and preferences set forth in any Statement of Preferences, including the Series A Preferred Shares. To the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, if applicable, and the applicable exchange on which the Preferred Shares are listed, in the event that more than one series of Preferred Shares are Outstanding, the Trust shall not effect any of the actions set forth in the preceding sentence which in the aggregate adversely affects the rights and preferences set forth in the Statement of Preferences for a series of Preferred Shares differently than such rights and preferences for any other series of Preferred Shares without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Preferred Shares Outstanding of each series adversely affected (each such adversely affected series voting separately as a class to the extent its rights are affected differently). The holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to vote on any matter that affects the rights or interests of only one or more other series of Preferred Shares. The Trust shall notify the relevant Rating Agency 10 Business Days prior to any such vote described above. Unless a higher percentage is required under the Governing Documents or applicable provisions of the DSTA or, if applicable, the 1940 Act, and for so long as, and only for so long, as the Trust is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Preferred Shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, will be required to approve any plan of reorganization (as defined in the 1940 Act) adversely affecting the Preferred Shares or any action requiring a vote of security holders under Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act. Effective immediately upon issuance of the Deregistration Order, the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and 
 12 

shall have no further effect. For so long as, and only for so long as, the Trust remains registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the phrase vote of the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Preferred Shares (or any like phrase) as used in this paragraph 5(c) shall mean, in accordance with Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act, the vote, at the annual or a special meeting of the shareholders of the Trust duly called (i) of 67 percent or more of the Preferred Shares present at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50 percent of the Outstanding Preferred Shares are present or represented by proxy or (ii) of more than 50 percent of the Outstanding Preferred Shares, whichever is less. The class votes of holders of Preferred Shares described in this paragraph 5(c) will in each case be in addition to a separate vote of the requisite percentage of Common Shares and Preferred Shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, necessary to authorize the action in question. An increase in the number of authorized Preferred Shares pursuant to the Governing Documents or the issuance of additional shares of any series of Preferred Shares (including Series A Preferred Shares), pursuant to the Governing Documents shall not in and of itself be considered to adversely affect the rights and preferences of the Preferred Shares and holders of the Series A Preferred Shares, by virtue of their acquisition of Series A Preferred Shares, will be deemed to have authorized such issuances by the Board of Trustees. 
 
 (c) Voting Procedures. 
 
 (i) As soon as practicable after the accrual of any right of the holders of Preferred Shares to elect additional trustees as described in paragraph 5(b) above, the Trust shall call a special meeting of such holders and instruct the Dividend Disbursing Agent to mail a notice of such special meeting to such holders, such meeting to be held not less than 10 nor more than 40 days after the date of mailing of such notice. If the Trust fails to send such notice to the Dividend Disbursing Agent or if the Trust does not call such a special meeting, it may be called by any such holder on like notice. The record date for determining the holders entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting shall be the close of business on the day on which such notice is mailed or such other date as the Board of Trustees shall determine. At any such special meeting and at each shareholder meeting held during a Voting Period for the purpose of electing trustees, such holders of Preferred Shares, voting together as a class (to the exclusion of the holders of all other securities and classes of capital shares of the Trust), shall be entitled to elect the number of trustees prescribed in paragraph 5(b) above on a one-vote-per-share basis.

 Exhibit 4.2 

 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 The following description summarizes the material provisions of the shares of beneficial interests of NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust (the Company , we , our registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). This description is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our restated certificate of trust, agreement and declaration of trust (the Declaration ), statement of preferences (the Statement of Preferences and, together with the Declaration, the Governing Instrument designating the 5.50 Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares (the Series A Preferred Shares and bylaws (together with the Governing Instrument, the Governing Documents and applicable provisions of Delaware law, including the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (the DSTA ). 
 Authorized Beneficial Interests 
 The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of its shares of beneficial interest, or capital shares, in multiple classes and series thereof as determined from time to time by the Board of Trustees (the Board ). The Company s authorized shares of beneficial interest consist of an unlimited number of its common shares, par value par value 0.001 per share, and an unlimited number of its preferred shares, par value .001 per share. The Board has designated a series of up to 4,800,000 preferred shares, par value 0.001 per share, liquidation preference 25.00 per share (the Liquidation Preference ), as the Series A Preferred Shares. As of December 31, 2022, there were 37,171,807 common shares and 3,359,593 Series A Preferred Shares issued and outstanding. All the outstanding common shares and Series A Preferred Shares are fully paid and nonassessable. 
 Subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences, the Board, in its discretion, may from time to time without vote of the shareholders issue shares of beneficial interest, including any preferred shares, in addition to the then issued and outstanding shares of beneficial interest and shares of beneficial interest held in the treasury. The Board may also authorize and issue such other securities of the Company as it determines to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, having such terms, rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and restrictions as the Board sees fit, including multiple classes of common shares, preferred interests, debt securities or other senior securities. To the extent the Board authorizes and issues additional shares of beneficial interest of any class or series, the Board is authorized, without shareholder approval, subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences, to amend or supplement the Declaration as it deems necessary or appropriate. Issuances and redemptions of shares of beneficial interest may be made in whole shares of beneficial interest and or l l,000ths of a share of beneficial interest or multiples thereof as the Board may determine. Except as otherwise provided by a majority of the Board, the Company s shares of beneficial interest are not redeemable by the holders. The Declaration provides that no shareholder of the Company will be subject in such capacity to any personal liability whatsoever to any person in connection with Company property or the acts, obligations or affairs of the Company, and that the shareholders of the Company will have the limitation of personal liability provided under the DSTA. 
 The Declaration provides that shareholders will have no power to vote on any matter except matters on which a vote of shareholders is required by the Declaration or by resolution of the Board. The Declaration expressly provides that no matter for which voting is required by the DSTA in the absence of the contrary provision in the Declaration will require any vote. Except as otherwise provided in the Declaration, any matter required to be submitted to shareholders and affecting one or more classes or series of shares of beneficial interest will require approval by the required vote of all the affected classes and series of shares of beneficial interest voting together as a single class provided, however, that as to any matter with respect to which a separate vote of any class or series of shares of beneficial interest is provided for by resolution of the Board, such requirement as to a separate vote by that class or series of shares of beneficial interest will apply in addition to a vote of all the affected classes and series voting together as a single class. Subject to the Statement of Preferences, shareholders of a particular class or series of shares of beneficial interest will not be entitled to vote on any matter that affects only one or more other classes or series of shares of beneficial interest. 
 Common Shares 
 Dividends 
 Subject to the preferential rights, if any, of holders of any other class or series of our shares of beneficial interest and to the provisions of the Declaration relating to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of beneficial interest, the holders of our common shares are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions on such common shares when, as and if authorized by the Board and declared by us out of assets legally available for distribution to our shareholders. In addition, subject to the preferential rights, if any, of holders of any other class or series of the our shares of beneficial interest, the holders of our common shares will be entitled to share ratably in the Company s 

property legally available for distribution to our shareholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up after payment of or adequate provision for payment all liabilities and upon receipt of such releases, indemnities and refunding agreements, as the Board deems necessary for protection of the trustees. 
 Voting 
 Subject to the provisions of our Declaration regarding restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of beneficial interest and except as may be otherwise specified in the terms of any class or series of our common shares, each outstanding common share entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of common shareholders, including the election of trustees. Our Governing Instrument provides that the holders of preferred shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, are entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of the common shares, voting together as a single class. 
 The Statement of Preferences provides that, except the Preferred Shares Trustees (defined below), the holders of the outstanding capital shares of the Company, voting as a single class, will elect the trustees. There is no cumulative voting in the election of trustees. Consequently, other than the Preferred Shares Trustees, the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital shares can elect all of the trustees then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining capital shares will not be able to elect any trustees. Trustees will be elected by a plurality of all of the votes cast in the election of trustees. 
 With respect to matters other than the election of trustees, (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of beneficial interest present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at a meeting where the holders of a majority of our shares of beneficial interest entitled to vote on the matter are present in person or represented by proxy (a Quorum ), will be the act of the shareholders with respect to such matters, and (ii) where a separate vote of one or more classes or series of shares of beneficial interest is required on any matter, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of beneficial interest of such class or series present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting where a Quorum is present will be the act of the shareholders of such class or series with respect to such matter, in each case subject to any provisions of the Declaration or a resolution of the Board specifying a greater or lesser requirement with respect to the vote or Quorum (the Voting Requirement ). 
 Under the DSTA, an agreement of merger or consolidation must be approved by all of the trustees and beneficial owners of the Company, unless otherwise provided in the Company s governing instrument. In addition, a conversion into another business entity must be approved by all of the trustees and beneficial owners of the Company, except that if the Company s governing instrument specifies a different manner of authorization with respect to approving such conversion or, if it does not so specify, does not prohibit such conversion and specifies a manner of authorization with respect to an agreement of merger or consolidation, that manner of authorization will be required. The DSTA further provides that the governing instrument of a statutory trust may be amended with the approval of all of the beneficial owners and trustees or as otherwise permitted by law, unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument of the statutory trust. In addition, under the DSTA, a statutory trust may not be terminated or revoked except in accordance with the governing instrument of the statutory trust and, except to the extent otherwise provided in the certificate of trust or in the governing instrument, the certificate of trust may be amended by the trustees. 
 The Declaration provides that a merger or consolidation requires approval by two-thirds of the trustees without a requirement for approval by our shareholders, except that any merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity requires approval of 75 of the holders of shares of beneficial interest of each affected class or series outstanding, voting as separate classes or series, unless such amendment has been approved by 80 of the trustees, in which case the Voting Requirement will apply (such voting exception and alternative, subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences, the Required Voting Alternatives ). The Declaration provides that the Company may be dissolved with approval of 80 of the trustees without a requirement for approval by our shareholders, except that the Required Voting Alternatives will apply to the sale, conveyance, assignment, exchange, merger in which the Company is not the survivor, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s property in winding up the affairs of the Company. In addition, the Declaration provides that it may only be amended if such amendment is approved by a majority of the trustees and that the Required Voting Alternatives also apply to certain amendments of the Declaration and the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Company s property. The Declaration does not specify approval requirements with respect to a conversion of the Company to another business entity. Neither the Declaration nor the restated certificate of trust specify approval requirements with respect to an amendment to the Company s restated certificate of trust. 
 In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Declaration provides that approval by a majority of the trustees followed by the approval of 75 of the holders of shares of beneficial interest of each affected class or series outstanding, voting as separate classes or series (subject to the Statement of Preferences, the Principal Shareholder Requirements will be required for certain transactions when a Principal Shareholder (defined generally to mean 
 2 

any corporation, person or other entity which is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 5 or more of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest of all outstanding classes or series and includes any affiliate or associate, as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, of a Principal Shareholder) is a party to the transaction. These transactions include any 
 merger or consolidation of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company with or into any Principal Shareholder 
 issuance of any securities of the Company to any Principal Shareholder for cash (other than pursuant to any automatic dividend reinvestment plan) 
 sale, lease or exchange of all or any substantial part of the assets of the Company to any Principal Shareholder (except assets having an aggregate fair market value of less than 2 of the total assets of the Company, aggregating for the purpose of such computation all assets sold, leased or exchanged in any series of similar transactions within a twelve-month period) or 
 sale, lease or exchange to the Company or any subsidiary thereof, in exchange for securities of the Company, of any assets of any Principal Shareholder (except assets having an aggregate fair market value of less than 2 of the total assets of the Company, aggregating for the purposes of such computation all assets sold, leased or exchanged in any series of similar transactions within a twelve-month period). 
 The Principal Shareholder Requirements are not applicable if (i) 80 of the trustees approve by resolution a memorandum of understanding with the Principal Shareholder with respect to and substantially consistent with such transaction followed by an approval by shareholders consistent with the Voting Requirement, or (ii) the transaction is with any entity of which a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of a stock normally entitled to vote in elections of directors is owned of record or beneficially by the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 Other Matters 
 Holders of our common shares have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, redemption or appraisal rights and have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any securities of the Company. Subject to the provisions of our Declaration regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of beneficial interest, our common shares will have equal distribution, liquidation and other rights. 
 The Declaration generally excludes The Corporation Trust Company or its successor from the meaning of the term trustees. The Corporation Trust Company is the Company s Delaware trustee and does not have any management responsibilities with respect to the Company other than certain administrative matters required by the DSTA. 
 Series A Preferred Shares 
 General 
 The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of preferred shares in one or more classes or series. The Board has designated a series of up to 4,800,000 preferred shares as the Series A Preferred Shares. As of December 31, 2022, there were 3,359,593 Series A Preferred Shares issued and outstanding. 
 Each class or series of the preferred shares will have such terms, rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and restrictions as the Board sees fit. Our Board may increase the number of authorized preferred shares or cause the issuance of additional shares of any series of preferred shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences. The Statement of Preferences provides that an increase in the number of authorized preferred shares or the issuance of additional shares of any series of preferred shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, pursuant to the Governing Documents will not in and of itself be considered to adversely affect the rights and preferences of the preferred shares and holders of the Series A Preferred Shares, by virtue of their acquisition of Series A Preferred Shares, will be deemed to have authorized such issuances by the Board. The Governing Instrument does not require the consent of holders of preferred shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, for the Board to authorize and issue additional shares of beneficial interest ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares with respect to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 Ranking 
 The Series A Preferred Shares, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, ranks senior to our common shares and any other shares of beneficial interest ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to such rights, and on a parity with any other series of preferred shares as to such rights 
 3 

to which such shares are entitled. The Series A Preferred Shares effectively rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness. 
 Dividends 
 Holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by, or under authority granted by, the Board, out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends and distributions at the rate of 5.50 per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) of the Liquidation Preference on the Series A Preferred Shares and no more, payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 in each year (each a Dividend Payment Date commencing on March 31, 2021 (or, if any such day is not a business day, then on the next succeeding business day). Dividends and distributions will be payable to holders of record of Series A Preferred Shares as they appear on the share register of the Company at the close of business on the fifth preceding business day (each, a Record Date in preference to dividends and distributions on common shares and any other capital shares ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in payment of dividends and distributions. Dividends and distributions on Series A Preferred Shares that were originally issued on the Date of Original Issue (as defined in the Statement of Preferences) will accumulate from the Date of Original Issue. Dividends and distributions on all other Series A Preferred Shares will accumulate from (i) the date on which such shares are originally issued if such date is a Dividend Payment Date, (ii) the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date if the date on which such shares are originally issued is other than a Dividend Payment Date and is on or before a Record Date or (iii) the immediately following Dividend Payment Date if the date on which such shares are originally issued is during the period between a Record Date and a Dividend Payment Date. Each period beginning on and including a Dividend Payment Date (or the Date of Original Issue, in the case of the first dividend period after the issuance of such shares) and ending on but excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date is a Dividend Period. Dividends and distributions on account of arrears for any past Dividend Period or in connection with the redemption of Series A Preferred Shares may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date not exceeding 30 days preceding the payment date thereof as will be fixed by the Board. 
 No full dividends or distributions will be declared or paid on Series A Preferred Shares for any Dividend Period or part thereof unless full cumulative dividends and distributions due through the most recent Dividend Payment Dates therefor for all series of preferred shares ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Shares as to the payment of dividends and distributions have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid through the most recent Dividend Payment Dates therefor. If full cumulative dividends and distributions due have not been paid on all such Outstanding (as defined in below) preferred shares, any dividends and distributions being paid on such preferred shares (including the Series A Preferred Shares) will be paid as nearly pro rata as possible in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends and distributions accumulated but unpaid on each such series of preferred shares on the relevant Dividend Payment Date. No holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to any dividends or distributions, whether payable in cash, property or shares, in excess of full cumulative dividends and distributions as provided in this paragraph on Series A Preferred Shares. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payments on any Series A Preferred Shares that may be in arrears. 
 For so long as Series A Preferred Shares are Outstanding, the Company will not declare or pay any dividend or other distribution (other than a dividend or distribution paid in common shares, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase common shares or other shares, if any, ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation) in respect of the common shares or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, or call for redemption, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any common shares or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation), unless, in each case, all cumulative dividends and distributions on all Series A Preferred Shares due on or prior to the date of the transaction have been declared and paid (or have been declared and sufficient funds for the payment thereof deposited with the applicable Dividend Disbursing Agent (as defined in the Statement of Preferences)). 
 Any dividend payment made on the Series A Preferred Shares will first be credited against the dividends and distributions accumulated with respect to the earliest Dividend Period for which dividends and distributions have not been paid. 
 Not later than the business day immediately preceding each Dividend Payment Date, the Company will deposit with the Dividend Disbursing Agent Deposit Assets (as defined in the Statement of Preferences) having an initial combined value sufficient to pay the dividends and distributions that are payable on such Dividend Payment Date, which Deposit Assets will mature (if such assets constitute debt securities or time deposits) on or prior to such 
 4 

Dividend Payment Date (the Requisite Deposit ). The Company may direct the Dividend Disbursing Agent with respect to the investment of any such Deposit Assets, provided that such investment consists exclusively of Deposit Assets and provided further that the proceeds of any such investment will be available at the opening of business on such Dividend Payment Date. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders, after satisfying claims of creditors but before any distribution or payment will be made in respect of the common shares or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to liquidation payments, the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends and distributions accumulated to and including the date fixed for such distribution or payment (whether or not earned or declared by the Company, but excluding interest thereon), and such holders will be entitled to no further participation in any distribution or payment in connection with any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets of the Company available for distribution among the holders of all Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, and any other Outstanding class or series of preferred shares ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Shares as to payment upon liquidation, will be insufficient to permit the payment in full to such holders of Series A Preferred Shares of the Liquidation Preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends and distributions and the amounts due upon liquidation with respect to such other preferred shares, then such available assets will be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Shares and such other preferred shares ratably in proportion to the respective preferential liquidation amounts to which they are entitled. Unless and until the Liquidation Preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends and distributions has been paid in full to the holders of Series A Preferred Shares, no dividends or distributions will be made to holders of the common shares or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to liquidation. 
 Redemption 
 Generally 
 The Series A Preferred Shares are not subject to mandatory redemption. Prior to December 15, 2023, the Series A Preferred Shares are not subject to optional redemption by the Company unless such redemption is necessary, in the judgment of the Board, to maintain the Company s status as a real estate investment trust REIT under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Commencing December 15, 2023, and thereafter, and prior thereto to the extent necessary to maintain the Company s status as a REIT under Subchapter M of the Code, to the extent permitted by DSTA, the Company may at any time upon Notice of Redemption (defined below) redeem the Series A Preferred Shares in whole or in part at a price equal to 25.00 per share plus accumulated but unpaid dividends and distributions (whether or not earned or declared by the Company) through, but not including, the date of redemption (the Redemption Price , which notice will specify a redemption date of not fewer than 30 days nor more than 90 days after the date of such notice. 
 Redemption Procedures 
 If the Company determines to redeem Series A Preferred Shares, it will mail a written notice of redemption Notice of Redemption with respect to such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of the shares to be redeemed at such holder s address as the same appears on the share register of the Company on the close of business on such date as the Board or its delegatee may determine, which date will not be earlier than the second business day prior to the date upon which such Notice of Redemption is mailed or delivered electronically to the holders of Series A Preferred Shares. Each such Notice of Redemption will state (A) the redemption date as established by the Board or its delegatee (B) the number of Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed (C) the CUSIP number(s) of such shares (D) the Redemption Price (specifying the amount of accumulated dividends and distributions to be included therein) (E) the place or places where the certificate(s) for such shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board or its delegatee so require and the Notice of Redemption so states), if any, are to be surrendered for payment in respect of such redemption (F) that dividends and distributions on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date (G) the provisions of paragraph 4 of the Statement of Preferences under which such redemption is made and (H) any conditions precedent to such redemption. If fewer than all Series A Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the Notice of Redemption mailed or delivered electronically to such holder also will specify the number or percentage of shares to be redeemed from such holder. No defect in the Notice of Redemption or the mailing thereof will affect the validity of the redemption proceedings, except as required by applicable law.

If the Company will give a Notice of Redemption, then by the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date specified in the Notice of Redemption (so long as any conditions precedent to such redemption have been met) or, if the Dividend Disbursing Agent so agrees, another date not later than the redemption date, the Company will (A) deposit with the Dividend Disbursing Agent Deposit Assets that will mature (if such assets constitute debt securities or time deposits) on or prior to such redemption date having an initial combined value sufficient to effect the redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed and (B) give the Dividend Disbursing Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares called for redemption on the redemption date. The Company may direct the Dividend Disbursing Agent with respect to the investment of any Deposit Assets so deposited provided that the proceeds of any such investment will be available at the opening of business on such redemption date. Upon the date of such deposit (unless the Company defaults in making payment of the Redemption Price), all rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares so called for redemption will cease and terminate except the right of the holders thereof to receive the Redemption Price thereof and such shares will no longer be deemed Outstanding for any purpose. The Company will be entitled to receive, promptly after the date fixed for redemption, any cash in excess of the aggregate Redemption Price of the Series A Preferred Shares called for redemption on such date and any remaining Deposit Assets. Any assets so deposited that are unclaimed at the end of two years from such redemption date will, to the extent permitted by law, be repaid to the Company, after which the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares so called for redemption will look only to the Company for payment of the Redemption Price thereof. The Company will be entitled to receive, from time to time after the date fixed for redemption, any interest on the Deposit Assets so deposited. 
 On or after the redemption date, each holder of Series A Preferred Shares that are subject to redemption will surrender such shares to the Company as instructed in the Notice of Redemption and will then be entitled to receive the cash Redemption Price, without interest. 
 In the case of any redemption of less than all of the Series A Preferred Shares pursuant to the Statement of Preferences, such redemption will be made pro rata from each holder of Series A Preferred Shares in accordance with the respective number of shares held by each such holder on the record date for such redemption. 
 Limitations 
 Notwithstanding the provisions with respect to redemption in the Statement of Preferences, the Company will not redeem any Series A Preferred Shares unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends and distributions on all Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares and other preferred shares ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Shares with respect to dividends and distributions for all applicable past Dividend Periods (whether or not earned or declared by the Company) have been or are contemporaneously paid or declared and the Requisite Deposit with the Dividend Disbursing Agent has been made provided, however, that the foregoing will not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Outstanding preferred shares pursuant to the successful completion of an otherwise lawful purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares. 
 If the Company does not have funds legally available for the redemption of, or is otherwise unable to redeem, all the Series A Preferred Shares or other preferred shares designated to be redeemed on any redemption date, the Company will redeem on such redemption date the number of Series A Preferred Shares and other preferred shares so designated as it has legally available funds, or is otherwise able, to redeem ratably on the basis of the Redemption Price from each holder whose shares are to be redeemed, and the remainder of the Series A Preferred Shares and other preferred shares designated to be redeemed will be redeemed on the earliest practicable date on which the Company will have funds legally available for the redemption of, or is otherwise able to redeem, such shares upon Notice of Redemption. 
 Voting Rights 
 The Statement of Preferences provides that, except as otherwise provided in the Governing Documents or a resolution of the Board, or as required by applicable law, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will have no power to vote on any matter except matters submitted to a vote of the common shares. In any matter submitted to a vote of the holders of the common shares, each holder of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to one vote for each Series A Preferred Share held, and the holders of preferred shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, and the common shares will vote together as a single class. 
 In addition, so long as the rules of a national securities exchange on which any of the Company s equity securities are listed requires holders of Series A Preferred Shares to have such right, during any period in which accumulated dividends and distributions (whether or not earned or declared, and whether or not funds are then legally available in an amount sufficient therefor) on the Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares equal to at least six full quarters dividends and distributions will be due and unpaid and sufficient Deposit Assets will not have been deposited with 
 6 

the Dividend Disbursing Agent for the payment of such accumulated dividends and distributions (a Voting Period ), holders of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, voting separately as one class (to the exclusion of the holders of all other securities and classes of capital shares of the Company, except for any other series of Outstanding preferred shares for which a like voting entitlement has arisen, with which the holders of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares will vote together as one class for this purpose), will be entitled to elect two of the Company s trustees (the Preferred Shares Trustees ). As soon as practicable after the accrual of any right of the holders of preferred shares to elect the Preferred Shares Trustees, the Company will call a special meeting of such holders and instruct the Dividend Disbursing Agent to mail a notice of such special meeting to such holders, such meeting to be held not less than 10 nor more than 40 days after the date of mailing of such notice. If the Company fails to send such notice to the Dividend Disbursing Agent or if the Company does not call such a special meeting, it may be called by any such holder on like notice. The record date for determining the holders entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting will be the close of business on the day on which such notice is mailed or such other date as the Board will determine. At any such special meeting and at each shareholder meeting held during a Voting Period for the purpose of electing trustees, such holders of preferred shares, voting together as a class (to the exclusion of the holders of all other securities and classes of capital shares of the Company), will be entitled to elect the Preferred Shares Trustees on a one-vote-per-share basis. At any such meeting, or adjournment thereof in the absence of a quorum, a majority of such holders present in person or by proxy will have the power to adjourn the meeting without notice, other than by an announcement at the meeting, to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date. 
 For purposes of determining any rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Shares to vote on any matter or the number of shares required to constitute a quorum, whether such right is created by the Statement of Preferences, by the other provisions of the Governing Documents, by statute or otherwise, any Series A Preferred Share which is not Outstanding will not be counted. Outstanding means, as of any date, preferred shares theretofore issued by the Company except 
 (a) any such preferred share theretofore cancelled by the Company or delivered to the Company for cancellation 
 (b) any such preferred share as to which a notice of redemption shall have been given and for whose payment at the redemption thereof Deposit Assets in the necessary amount are held by the Company in trust for, or have been irrevocably deposited with the relevant disbursing agent for payment to, the holder of such share pursuant to the Statement of Preferences with respect thereto and 
 (c) any such preferred share in exchange for or in lieu of which other shares have been issued and delivered. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of voting rights (including the determination of the number of shares required to constitute a quorum), any preferred share as to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is the holder will be disregarded and deemed not Outstanding. 
 The Company and the Board will take all necessary actions, including effecting the removal of trustees or amendment of the Declaration, to effect an adjustment of the number and or composition of trustees as described with respect to the entitlement to elect the Preferred Shares Trustees. Upon the expiration of a Voting Period, the terms of office of the Preferred Shares Trustees will expire at the earliest time permitted by law and the voting rights with respect to the Preferred Shares Trustees will cease, subject, however, to the preferred shares voting rights upon the further occurrence of any of the events described with respect to a Voting Period. Upon the expiration of the terms of office of the Preferred Share Trustees, the number of trustees will be automatically reduced to the number of trustees on the Board immediately preceding such Voting Period if the number of trustees on the Board was increased in connection with a Voting Period. 
 Subject to a Rating Agency Amendment (defined below), so long as any Series A Preferred Shares are Outstanding, we will not 
 (a) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Statement of Preferences so as to in the aggregate adversely affect the rights and preferences set forth in any statement of preferences, including with respect to the Series A Preferred Shares, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the preferred shares Outstanding at the time, voting separately as one class or 
 (b) to the extent permitted by the applicable exchange on which the preferred shares are listed, in the event that more than one series of preferred shares are Outstanding, amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Statement of Preferences which in the aggregate adversely affects the rights and preferences set forth in the statement of preferences for a series of preferred shares differently than such rights and preferences for any other series of 
 7 

preferred shares without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the preferred shares Outstanding of each series adversely affected (each such adversely affected series voting separately as a class to the extent its rights are affected differently). 
 The class votes of holders of preferred shares described (a) and (b) above will in each case be in addition to a separate vote of the requisite percentage of common shares and preferred shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, necessary to authorize the action in question. An increase in the number of authorized preferred shares pursuant to the Governing Documents or the issuance of additional shares of any series of preferred shares (including Series A Preferred Shares), pursuant to the Governing Documents will not in and of itself be considered to adversely affect the rights and preferences of the preferred shares and holders of the Series A Preferred Shares, by virtue of their acquisition of Series A Preferred Shares, will be deemed to have authorized such issuances by the Board. 
 The Board, without further action by the shareholders, may amend, alter, add to or repeal any provision of the Statement of Preferences that has been adopted by the Company pursuant to the guidelines of a rating agency providing a rating for the Series A Preferred Shares at the request of the Company (the Rating Agency or add covenants and other obligations of the Company to the Statement of Preferences, if the applicable Rating Agency confirms that such amendments or modifications are necessary to prevent a reduction in, or the withdrawal of, a rating of the preferred shares and such amendments and modifications do not adversely affect the rights and preferences of and are in the aggregate in the best interests of the holders of the preferred shares (collectively, a Rating Agency Amendment ). 
 The Board, without further action by the shareholders, may amend, alter, add to or repeal any provision of the Statement of Preferences including provisions that have been adopted by the Company pursuant to the Rating Agency guidelines, if such amendments or modifications will not in the aggregate adversely affect the rights and preferences of the holders of any series of the preferred shares, provided, that the Company has received confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency that such amendment or modification would not adversely affect such Rating Agency s then-current rating of such series of the Company s preferred shares. 
 Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, to the extent permitted by law, the Board or its delegatee, without the vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares or any other shares of the Company, may amend the provisions of the Statement of Preferences to resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity or to remedy any formal defect so long as the amendment does not in the aggregate adversely affect the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Shares. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer 
 For information regarding restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Series A Preferred Shares, see Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer below. 
 Preemptive Rights 
 No holders of Series A Preferred Shares will, as the holders, have any preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for our common shares, preferred shares or any other security of the Company. 
 Information Rights 
 Shareholders have the right to inspect the records of the Company, including, without limitation, shareholder lists, documents, accounts and books of the Company only to the extent inalienably granted under the DSTA all other such rights whether or not provided in the DSTA are expressly precluded. All shareholders requests to inspect the records of the Company will be submitted by shareholders to the Board in writing. Upon receipt of such requests, the Board may in its discretion establish procedures for any permitted inspections. To preserve the integrity of the Company s records, the Board may provide certified copies of Company records rather than originals. The Board will not be required to create records or obtain records from third parties to satisfy shareholders requests. The Company may require shareholders to pay in advance or otherwise indemnify the Company for the costs and expenses of shareholders inspection of records. None of the foregoing is intended nor will be construed to permit shareholders to inspect the records of the Company except as may be required by the DSTA or permitted by the Board in its discretion. 
 Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized Shares of Beneficial Interest, Reclassify Unissued Shares of Beneficial Interest and Issue Additional Common and Preferred Shares 
 8 

The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of its shares of beneficial interest, or capital shares, in multiple classes and series thereof as determined from time to time by the Board. The Board, in its discretion, may from time to time without vote of the shareholders issue shares of beneficial interest, including any preferred shares, in addition to the then issued and outstanding shares of beneficial interest and shares of beneficial interest held in the treasury, subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences. The Board may also authorize and issue such other securities of the Company as it determines to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, having such terms, rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and restrictions as the Board sees fit, including multiple classes of common shares, preferred interests, debt securities or other senior securities. To the extent the Board authorizes and issues additional shares of beneficial interest of any class or series, the Board is authorized, without shareholder approval, subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences, to amend or supplement the Declaration as it deems necessary or appropriate. The Board may from time to time divide or combine the shares of beneficial interest into a greater or lesser number without thereby changing the proportionate beneficial interest in such shares. 
 Our Board may increase the number of authorized preferred shares or cause the issuance of additional shares of any series of preferred shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, subject to the terms of the Statement of Preferences. The Statement of Preferences provides that an increase in the number of authorized preferred shares or the issuance of additional shares of any series of preferred shares, including Series A Preferred Shares, pursuant to the Governing Documents will not in and of itself be considered to adversely affect the rights and preferences of the preferred shares and holders of the Series A Preferred Shares, by virtue of their acquisition of Series A Preferred Shares, will be deemed to have authorized such issuances by the Board. The Governing Instrument does not require the consent of holders of preferred shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, for the Board to authorize and issue additional shares of beneficial interest ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares with respect to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 As a result of the above, although our Board does not currently intend to do so, it could authorize the issuance of shares of beneficial interest with terms and conditions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price to holders of our shares. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer 
 In order for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, our shares of beneficial interest must be owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months (other than the first year for which an election to qualify as a REIT has been made) or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy other requirements as well. 
 The Declaration contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of shares of beneficial interest. The relevant sections of the Declaration provide that, subject to the exceptions described below, no person or entity may own, or be deemed to own, beneficially or by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8 , in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding common shares (the common share ownership limit ), or 9.8 , in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of any class or series (the aggregate share ownership limit ). We refer to the common share ownership limit and the aggregate share ownership limit collectively as the ownership limits. 
 The constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause our shares of beneficial interest owned beneficially or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be owned beneficially or constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8 , in value or in number of the shares, of the outstanding common shares or the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of any class or series (or the acquisition by an individual or entity of an interest in an entity that owns, beneficially or constructively, any such shares), could, nevertheless, cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own beneficially or constructively our shares of beneficial interest in excess of the ownership limits. 
 The ownership limits apply during the period commencing on the date on which the shareholders approved the conversion of the Company from an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, to a REIT (the Initial Date and prior to the date on which the Board may determine that compliance with the restrictions and limitations on beneficial ownership, constructive ownership and transfers set forth below (the Restrictions are no longer in the best interests of the Company (the Restriction Termination Date ), but subject to the provision of the Declaration providing that such Restrictions will not preclude the settlement of any 
 9 

transaction entered into the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE or any other national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. During such period 
 (i) (1) No person, other than a person (an Excepted Holder for whom a percentage limit (subject to the terms of the Declaration, an Excepted Holder Limit is established by the Board in accordance with the Declaration, will beneficially own or constructively own shares of beneficial interest in excess of the aggregate share ownership limit, or such other percentage determined by the Board in accordance with provisions in the Declaration pertaining to the increase or decrease of such percentage, (2) no person, other than an Excepted Holder, will beneficially own or constructively own shares of beneficial interest in excess of the common share ownership limit, or such other percentage determined by the Board in accordance with provisions in the Declaration pertaining to the increase or decrease of such percentage, and (3) no Excepted Holder will beneficially own or constructively own shares of beneficial interest in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder. 
 (ii) No person will beneficially own or constructively own shares of beneficial interest to the extent that such beneficial ownership or constructive ownership of shares of beneficial interest would result in the Company being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, beneficial ownership or constructive ownership that would result in Company (or any subsidiary REIT thereof, as applicable) owning (actually or constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by Company (or such subsidiary) from such tenant would cause Company (or such subsidiary) to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code, taking into account any other income of Company (or such subsidiary) that would not constitute qualifying income under such requirements). 
 (iii) Any transfer of shares of beneficial interest that, if effective, would result in such shares being beneficially owned by less than 100 persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) will be void ab initio, and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares. 
 (iv) No person will beneficially own or constructively own shares of beneficial interest to the extent that such beneficial ownership or constructive ownership of shares of beneficial interest would result in the Company failing to qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code. 
 In addition, if any transfer of shares of beneficial interest (whether or not such transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of the NYSE or any other national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) occurs which, if effective, would result in any person beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of beneficial interest in violation of the Restrictions, then that number of shares of beneficial ownership the beneficial ownership or constructive ownership of which otherwise would cause such person to violate the Restrictions (rounded up to the nearest whole share) will be automatically transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary, effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of such transfer (a Charitable Transfer ), and such person will acquire no rights in such shares provided, that if the transfer to the charitable trust described by the foregoing would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of the Restrictions, then the transfer of that number of shares of beneficial interest that otherwise would cause any person to violate the Restrictions will be void ab initio, and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares of beneficial interest. 
 To the extent that, upon a Charitable Transfer, a violation of any provision of the Declaration governing restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares would nonetheless be continuing (for example where the ownership of shares of beneficial interest by a single charitable trust would violate the 100 shareholder requirement applicable to REITs), then shares of beneficial interest will be transferred to that number of charitable trusts, each having a distinct charitable trustee and a charitable beneficiary or charitable beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each other trust, such that there is no violation of any such provisions. 
 In determining which shares of beneficial interest should be subject to a Charitable Transfer, shares of beneficial interest will be so transferred to a charitable trust in such manner that minimizes the aggregate value of the shares of beneficial interest that are transferred to the charitable trust (except to the extent that the Board determines that the shares of beneficial interest transferred to the charitable trust will be those directly or indirectly held or beneficially owned or constructively owned by a person or persons that caused or contributed to the application of the provision of the Declaration requiring a Charitable Transfer), and to the extent not inconsistent therewith, on a pro rata basis. 
 If the Board at any time determines that a transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of the Restrictions or the terms relating to a Charitable Transfer, or that a person intends to acquire or has attempted to 
 10 

acquire beneficial ownership or constructive ownership of any shares in violation the same (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board will take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem shares of beneficial interest, refusing to give effect to such transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such transfer or other event provided, however, that any transfer or attempted transfer or other event in violation of the Restrictions will automatically result in the transfer to the charitable trust described above, and, where applicable, such transfer (or other event) will be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board. 
 The Declaration requires that any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial ownership or constructive ownership of shares of beneficial ownership that will or may violate the Restrictions or any person who would have owned shares of beneficial interest that resulted in a Charitable Transfer will immediately give written notice to the Company of such event or, in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice, and will provide to the Company such other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such transfer on Company s status as a REIT. 
 The Declaration also requires that, from the Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date, (a) every owner of five percent or more (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) in number or value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of shares of beneficial interest beneficially owned and a description of the manner in which such shares are held. Each such owner must provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such beneficial ownership on the Company s status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the aggregate share ownership limit and the common share ownership limit and the other restrictions set forth herein and (b) each person who is a beneficial owner or constructive owner of shares of beneficial interest and each person (including the shareholder of record) who is holding shares of beneficial interest for a beneficial owner or constructive owner shall provide to the Company such information as the Company may request in good faith in order to determine the Company s status as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance. 
 Subject to the Restrictions (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Board may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit, as the case may be, and may establish or increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such person if the Company obtains such representations and undertakings from such person as are reasonably necessary for the Board to determine that 
 (i) no person s beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of beneficial interest will violate (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the Restrictions and 
 (ii) such person does not and will not own, actually or constructively, an interest in a tenant of the Company (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by the Company, including a subsidiary REIT) that would cause the Company (or such subsidiary REIT) to own, actually or constructively, more than a 9.9 interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant (for this purpose, a tenant shall not be treated as a tenant of the Company if the Company (or an entity owned or controlled by the Company, including such subsidiary REIT) derives (and is expected to continue to derive) a sufficiently small amount of revenue from such tenant such that, in the judgment of the Board, rent from such tenant would not adversely affect the Company s (or such subsidiary REIT s) ability to qualify as a REIT). 
 Any violation or attempted violation of any such representations or undertakings (or other action which is contrary to the Restrictions) will result in such shares of beneficial interest being automatically subject to a Charitable Transfer. 
 Prior to granting any exception pursuant to the foregoing (a Representation Exception ), the Board may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Company s status as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exception. 
 Subject to the Restriction (ii), an underwriter or placement agent that participates in a public offering or a private placement of the shares of beneficial interest (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of beneficial interest) may beneficially own or constructively own shares of beneficial interest (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of beneficial interest) in excess of the aggregate share ownership limit, the common share 
 11 

ownership limit, or both such limits, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public offering or private placement. 
 The Board may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder with the written consent of such Excepted Holder or pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No Excepted Holder Limit will be reduced to a percentage that is less than the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit, as the case may be. 
 In addition, subject to Restriction (ii) and the following, the Board may from time to time increase or decrease the common share ownership limit or the aggregate share ownership limit for one or more persons and increase or decrease the common share ownership limit or the aggregate share ownership limit for all other persons. No decreased common share ownership limit or aggregate share ownership limit will be effective for any person whose percentage of ownership of shares of beneficial interest is in excess of such decreased common share ownership limit or aggregate share ownership limit, as applicable, until such time as such person s percentage of ownership of shares of beneficial interest equals or falls below the decreased common share ownership limit or aggregate share ownership limit, as applicable provided, however, any further acquisition of shares of beneficial interest by any such person (other than a person for whom an Representation Exception has been granted or an Excepted Holder) in excess of the shares of beneficial interest owned by such person on the date the decreased common share ownership limit or aggregate share ownership limit, as applicable, became effective will be in violation of the common share ownership limit or aggregate share ownership limit. No increase to the common share ownership limit or aggregate share ownership limit may be approved if the new common share ownership limit and or aggregate share ownership limit would allow five or fewer persons to beneficially own, in the aggregate more than 49.8 in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest. 
 Any certificates representing our shares of beneficial interest will bear a legend referring to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock described above. 
 These restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of beneficial interest will not apply upon the Restriction Termination Date. 
 The restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of beneficial interest described above, including in Article XII of the Declaration, could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

Borrower and Lender acknowledge and agree that Mezzanine Loan Administrative Agent and Mezzanine Lender are each an intended third-party beneficiary of the right to prepay the Loan from the proceeds of a Special Mezzanine Loan Advance as described above, and that such provisions shall not be modified or waived without Mezzanine Loan Administrative Agent's and Mezzanine Lender's prior written consent. 
 2.3.5 Mandatory Prepayments . On the next occurring Payment Date following the date on which Administrative Agent actually receives any Net Proceeds, if Administrative Agent is not obligated, or does not elect pursuant to the terms hereof (to the extent it has a right to such election under the Loan Documents), to make such Net Proceeds available to Borrower for Restoration, Borrower is hereby deemed to have authorized Administrative Agent to apply such Net Proceeds as a prepayment of the Outstanding Principal Balance, together with unpaid 
 LOAN AGREEMENT Page 45 

interest thereon, and any other portion of the Debt, in an amount equal to the lesser of one hundred percent (100 of such Net Proceeds or the amount of the Debt, and to remit any remaining Net Proceeds, if any, to Mezzanine Loan Administrative Agent to be applied in accordance with the terms of the Mezzanine Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, so long as no Event of Default then exists, no Minimum Multiple shall be due in connection with any prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.3.5 (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Exit Fee is a deferred financing fee and is applicable to any such prepayment). 
 2.3.6 Taxes . 
 (a) Payment of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Legal Requirements. If any Legal Requirement requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.3.6(a) the applicable Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements any Other Taxes. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent within ten (10) days after demand therefor, the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.3.6(a) payable or paid by such Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.3.6(a) , Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment satisfactory to Administrative Agent. 
 (b) Status of Lender . Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower, (i) prior to becoming a party to this agreement or obtaining any interest in the Loan, (ii) at the time or times requested by Borrower, and (iii) if any form or certification previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, if reasonably requested by Borrower, any Lender shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Legal Requirements (or reasonably requested by Borrower) as will enable Borrower to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable Legal Requirements (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as may be necessary for Borrower to comply with its obligations under FATCA and 
 LOAN AGREEMENT Page 46

 (c) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.3.6 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.3.6(c) ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.3.6 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.3.6(c) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.3.6(c) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.3.6(c) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 2.3.6(c) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (d) Survival . Each party's obligations under this Section 2.3.6 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and or Administrative Agent, the termination of the commitments to make Additional Advances, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 (e) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.3.8 , or requires Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.3.6(a) , then such Lender shall (at the request of Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loan hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to such Sections 2.3.6 or 2.3.8 , as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 2.3.7 Breakage Indemnity . Borrower shall indemnify Administrative Agent and Lenders against any Losses which Administrative Agent and or any Lender may actually sustain or incur in liquidating or redeploying deposits from third parties acquired to effect or maintain the Loan or any part thereof as a consequence of (i) any payment or prepayment of the Loan or any portion thereof made on a date other than a Payment Date and (ii) any failure to pay the Debt or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the date thereof or otherwise, and whether by acceleration or otherwise). Administrative Agent shall deliver to Borrower a statement for any such sums which it or any Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.3.7 , which statement shall be binding and conclusive absent manifest error. 
 LOAN AGREEMENT Page 47 

Borrower's obligations under this Section 2.3.7 are in addition to Borrower's obligations to pay any Minimum Multiple and Exit Fee applicable to a payment or prepayment of the Outstanding Principal Balance. 
 2.3.8 Legal Requirements . If any Change in Law shall (a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the determination of the LIBOR rate hereunder), (b) subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than (i) Indemnified Taxes, (ii) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Indemnified Taxes, and (iii) Other Connection Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, or (c) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loan made by such Lender or participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing circumstances described in clauses (a) through (c) shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining the Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make the Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, in any such case, upon request of such Lender, Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loan made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in this Section 2.3.8 and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.3.8 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3.8 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than twelve (12) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the twelve-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Property Taxes or other charges assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Property, or any part thereof, for property tax purposes by reason of the Security Instrument or the Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, or if payment of any Tax by Borrower required hereunder is unlawful, unenforceable, taxable to Lender, or provides the basis for a defense of usury, then in either such case Administrative Agent shall have the option by written notice of not less than one hundred eighty (180) days to declare the Debt immediately due and payable (and any failure to repay the Debt by the end of such 180-day period shall be an Event of Default).

Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month. 
 (f) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance thereof shall not, in the good faith opinion of Administrative Agent, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated in good faith by Administrative Agent to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the deficiency with Administrative Agent before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made, and such sums shall be held by Administrative Agent and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to Section 5.1.12(e) shall constitute additional security for the Debt and the Obligations.

All other Net Proceeds not required to be made available for Restoration or to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant to this Section 5.1.12 hereof shall be either retained and applied by Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.3.5 hereof toward reduction of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority and proportions as Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Administrative Agent, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes as Administrative Agent shall approve, in its discretion.

At Administrative Agent's option, it shall be an Event of Default (if Administrative Agent so notifies Borrower in writing) if Borrower does not complete such work in accordance with all Administrative Agent-approved plans and specifications by such required deadline. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Administrative Agent may retain a construction consultant and other consultants deemed necessary or desirable by Administrative Agent, at Borrower's expense, to make periodic inspections of the Property and to review all change orders relating to the Project. Administrative Agent may request such consultants before making any Additional Advance to inspect all work and materials for which payment is requested and all other work upon the Property and or submit to Administrative Agent a progress inspection report.

Borrower shall be responsible for making its own inspections of the Property during the course of construction and shall determine to its own satisfaction that the work done and materials supplied are in accordance with applicable contracts with its contractors. By advancing funds after any inspection of the Property by Administrative Agent or its consultants, Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to waive any Event of Default, waive any right to require construction defects or any other work to be corrected, or acknowledge that all construction conforms to the Administrative Agent-approved plans and specifications. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Administrative Agent should determine that the actual quality or value of the work performed or the materials furnished does not correspond with the quality or value of the work required by the Administrative Agent-approved plans and specifications, upon Administrative

In connection with any filing pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with or relating to a Securitization, Borrower shall (i) indemnify the Lender Group and the Underwriter Group for the above-described liabilities to which the Lender Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as such liabilities arise out of or are based upon the omission to state in the Applicable Sections so certified by Borrower a material fact required to be stated in such Applicable Sections in order to make the statements in such Applicable Sections, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any material respect, and (ii) reimburse the Lender Group and the Underwriter Group for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Lender Group or the Underwriter Group in connection with defending or investigating such liabilities. 
 (b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this Section 7.3 of notice of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7.3 , notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have to any Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is brought against any Indemnified Party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party under this Section 7.3 , such indemnifying party shall pay for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than costs of investigation provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal defenses available to it and or other Indemnified Parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf 
 LOAN AGREEMENT Page 100 

of such Indemnified Party at the cost of the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel unless an Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to another Indemnified Party. 
 (c) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section 7.3 is for any reason held to be unenforceable as to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under this Section 7.3 , the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (or action in respect thereof) provided , however , that no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered (i) the relative knowledge of Borrower and the applicable issuer(s) of the Securities in connection with the Securitization, and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Administrative Agent and Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. 
 (d) The liabilities and obligations of Borrower, Lender and Administrative Agent under this Section 7.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the satisfaction and discharge of the Debt. 
 Section 7.4. Rating Agency Confirmations . Borrower acknowledges and agrees that if the Loan is part of a Securitization, Administrative Agent may be required to obtain confirmation from one or more Rating Agencies that the granting of certain consents, approvals, or waivers (and certain other actions of Administrative Agent) will not cause a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of any ratings of the Securities or any class thereof, and that any such consent or approval by Administrative Agent may be conditioned upon receipt of such confirmation and the satisfaction of any conditions precedent thereto required by such Rating Agencies (and any use of the phrase approval of Administrative Agent (or similar) shall be deemed to mean and include receipt of such confirmation by Administrative Agent from such Rating Agencies). The circumstances under which this might arise include, but are not limited to, request to approve the replacement of a property manager, and requests for approvals of Transfers. Borrower shall be responsible for any and all fees and costs incurred in order to obtain any such Rating Agency confirmation (and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to require payment of such fees and expenses as a condition precedent to the obtaining of any such consent, approval, waiver or confirmation).

 LOAN AGREEMENT Page 107

 Section 8.19. Brokers and Financial Advisors . Borrower hereby represents that, except for JLL, the fees of which shall be paid solely by Borrower, it has dealt with no financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 8.21. Time is of the Essence . Time is of the essence of each provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 Section 8.22. Certain Additional Rights of Administrative Agent (VCOC) .

The rights described above in this Section 8.22 may be exercised by Lender or any entity which owns and Controls, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the interests in Lender or Administrative Agent. 
 Section 8.23. Duplicate Originals, Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of duplicate originals and each duplicate original shall be deemed to be an original 
 LOAN AGREEMENT Page 109 

and all of which together shall constitute a single agreement. The failure of any party hereto to execute this Agreement, or any counterpart hereof, shall relieve the other signatories from their obligations hereunder. 
 Section 8.24. Prepayment Charges . Borrower acknowledges that (a) Lender is making the Loan in consideration of the receipt by Lender of all interest and other benefits intended to be conferred by the Loan Documents that is not prepayable except as provided in Sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 , and (b) if payments of principal are made to a Lender prior to the regularly scheduled due date for such payment, for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary, as a result of Administrative Agent's acceleration of the Loan during the existence of an Event of Default, by operation of law or otherwise, Lender will not receive all such interest and other benefits and may, in addition, incur costs and expenses. For these reasons, and to induce Lender to make the Loan, Borrower expressly waives any right or privilege to prepay the Loan except as otherwise may be specifically permitted herein and agrees that, except for any prepayment that is expressly permitted to be made pursuant to this Agreement without the payment of the Exit Fee and Minimum Multiple (as applicable), all prepayments, if any, whether voluntary or involuntary, will be accompanied by the Exit Fee and Minimum Multiple (as applicable), which shall constitute additional interest.

Without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, until the Debt is indefeasibly repaid in full and Guarantor's obligations hereunder have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full (except for only those obligations which, by their express terms, survive indefeasible repayment of the Debt), Guarantor shall not (a) exercise or enforce any creditor's right it may have against Borrower or (b) foreclose, repossess, sequester or otherwise take steps or institute any action or proceedings (judicial or otherwise, including without limitation the commencement of, or joinder in, any liquidation, bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtor's relief or insolvency proceeding) to enforce any liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, collateral rights, judgments or other encumbrances on assets of Borrower held by Guarantor.

 RECITALS 
 WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Loan Agreement dated of even date herewith among CP TOWER OWNER, LLC , a Delaware limited liability company, and CP LAND OWNER, LLC , a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, Borrower ), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Administrative Agent (as the same may be amended, the Loan Agreement ), Lender has agreed to make a Loan to Borrower on the terms and conditions described therein capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement and 
 WHEREAS, Lender is not willing to make the Loan to Borrower unless Guarantor executes and delivers this Guaranty. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, as an inducement to Lender to make the Loan to Borrower, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows 
 1. Guaranty of Obligation . 
 (a) Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders) the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations as and when the same shall be due and payable, whether by lapse of time, by acceleration of maturity or otherwise. Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally covenants and agrees that it is fully and personally liable for the Guaranteed Obligations as a primary obligor as set forth herein. As used herein, the term Guaranteed Obligations means the complete payment and performance (as applicable) when due of Borrower's obligations pursuant to the Loan Agreement to (i) Complete the Project in its entirety in accordance with the Project Documents, the Administrative Agent-approved Plans and Specifications, all Legal Requirements, and the Loan Documents, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Encumbrances not consisting of liens for labor or materials) (collectively, the Requirements (ii) pay all expenses, charges, costs and fees of, or relating to, the Completion of the Project (including, without limitation, hard costs, soft costs, all permitting fees, licensing fees, amounts payable under all construction contracts and all subcontracts, amounts payable to the general contractor, all architects, engineers and other consultants engaged in connection with the Completion of the Project (and including, without limitation, any amount necessary to remove any Lien (other than Permitted Encumbrances not consisting of liens for labor or materials) filed against the Property in connection with the Completion of the Project), in the amount specified pursuant to Section 1(b) or Section 1(c) below, whichever is applicable (as elected by Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion) and (iii) pay to Administrative Agent the amount necessary to cure any Balancing Event. 
 (b) Without limiting any of Administrative Agent's or Lender's right hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, during the existence of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall have the option to (i) cause the Completion of the Project 
 COMPLETION GUARANTY Page 1 
 59940-29 Cityplace Tower 

(ii) pay any expenses described herein as part of the Guaranteed Obligations and or (iii) cause the removal of any Lien on the Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances not consisting of liens for labor or materials). In each such instance, Guarantor shall within ten (10) Business Days of Administrative Agent's written demand, reimburse Administrative Agent and Lender for all sums paid by Administrative Agent or Lender with respect thereto, including any reasonable attorney's fees in connection therewith provided , however , that Guarantor's payment obligations with respect to this Section 1(b) shall be limited to the sum of (A) all Actual Cost Overruns (as defined below), less (B) any amounts then held by Administrative Agent and delivered by Borrower in connection with curing of any Balancing Event. Nothing in this Section 1(b) shall limit Guarantor's obligations under Section 4 below. As used herein, the term Actual Cost Overruns means the excess, if any, of (1) all costs actually incurred in connection with the Completion of the Project free of Liens (other than the Liens of the Loan Documents), minus (2) without duplication of amounts deducted above, the amounts then contained in any Reserve Account pursuant to the Loan Agreement that would have otherwise been available to Borrower to pay for the cost of the Project, minus (3) the unadvanced amount of funds that would have otherwise been available to Borrower as an Additional Advance to pay for the cost of the Project pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement. 
 (c) Without limiting any of Administrative Agent's or Lender's rights hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, whether or not Administrative Agent shall elect to exercise its rights under the Loan Documents to Complete the Project, Administrative Agent shall have the option, in its sole and absolute discretion, exercisable from and after the date when Administrative Agent shall be entitled to cause Guarantor to pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder, to require Guarantor to pay to Administrative Agent, as Guarantor's sole liability for payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and as liquidated damages, an amount equal to the sum of (i) all Projected Cost Overruns (as defined below), less (ii) any amounts then held by Administrative Agent and delivered by Borrower in connection with curing of any Balancing Event. Such payment shall be due no later than ten (10) Business Days following Administrative Agent's written demand therefor. If Administrative Agent elects to receive such payment under this Section 1(c) , such payment shall be as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the parties agreeing the estimation of Administrative Agent's and Lender's actual damages on account of Borrower's and Guarantor's failure to Complete the Project would be difficult to estimate. Nothing in this Section 1(c) shall limit Guarantor's obligations under Section 4 below. As used herein, the term Projected Cost Overruns means the excess, if any, of (A) all costs of Completing the applicable Project estimated by Administrative Agent as of the date Administrative Agent demands payment by Guarantor under this Guaranty (even if Administrative Agent does not intend to Complete the Project) free of Liens (other than the Liens of the Loan Documents), minus (B) without duplication of amounts deducted above, the amounts then contained in any Reserve Account pursuant to the Loan Agreement that would have otherwise been available to Borrower to pay for the cost of the Project, minus (C) the unadvanced amount of funds that would have otherwise been available to Borrower as an Additional Advance to pay for the cost of the Project pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement. 
 (d) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the unpaid amount of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 , if not paid when due pursuant to this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents, shall, at Administrative Agent's election in its sole and absolute discretion, be deemed to be added to and form a part of the Debt for all purposes under the Loan Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, Guarantor's obligation to pay the unpaid amount of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 shall survive any foreclosure or the giving of any deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Property, and shall not be reduced or limited by any repayment of the Loan or by any amount bid by Administrative Agent in connection with any foreclosure under the Loan Documents. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty to pay to Administrative Agent the unpaid amount 
 COMPLETION GUARANTY Page 2 
 59940-29 Cityplace Tower 

of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 are separate and distinct from any obligation of Borrower to repay the Debt, and that such obligation does not constitute a guaranty of the Loan or of any of Borrower's obligations with respect to the Loan except to the extent that such unpaid amount of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 are actually added to and form a part of the Debt as provided above. 
 (e) By its acceptance of this Guaranty, Administrative Agent and Lender each agrees to the following terms and conditions 
 (i) As used in this Guaranty, the term Completion Guaranty Event of Default shall mean the existence of any of the following events (A) the failure by Guarantor to cause a Balancing Event not to exist within the time period (with all applicable time periods commencing as of the applicable dates on which notice thereof is delivered to Guarantor in accordance with the requirements of this Guaranty) during which Borrower is required to cause the same not to exist pursuant to the Loan Agreement (B) the failure by Guarantor at any time to be diligently pursuing the Completion of the Project (C) the failure by Guarantor to pay any amount then due to Administrative Agent and Lender under this Guaranty within ten (10) Business Days after written notice thereof from Administrative Agent (D) the existence of an Event of Default as described in Sections 6.1(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (j), or (m) of the Loan Agreement and (E) the existence of any other Event of Default that is susceptible of being cured by Guarantor on the Borrower's behalf. 
 (ii) In the event that Administrative Agent demands that Guarantor undertake the Completion of the Project, then so long as a Completion Guaranty Event of Default does not then exist, Lender agrees to continue to make Additional Advances to Guarantor and make disbursements to Guarantor from any applicable Reserve Account, in either case for the payment or reimbursement of applicable Project Expenditures, subject to the following terms and conditions 
 (A) Guarantor shall have satisfied all of the other Borrower obligations which are conditions precedent to the making of an Additional Advance or the disbursement of funds from any applicable Reserve Account for the payment or reimbursement of Project Expenditures, as applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, the existence of an Event of Default that is not a Completion Guaranty Event of Default shall not preclude Guarantor from obtaining such Additional Advance or disbursement) 
 (B) Borrower and Guarantor shall have executed an acknowledgement in form and content reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent that (1) such Additional Advance or disbursement has been made to or for the benefit of Borrower pursuant to the Loan Agreement, and (2) the agreement by Lender to make such further Additional Advances or disbursements to Guarantor pursuant to this Section 1(e) shall not prejudice or impair the right of Administrative Agent to demand performance by Borrower or Guarantor of any of their respective obligations under the Loan Documents, to declare Defaults or Events of Default under the Loan Documents, to exercise any rights and remedies thereunder, or be deemed to be a waiver, estoppel, acceptance of course of conduct or forbearance by Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and 
 (C) all Additional Advances and disbursements made to Guarantor pursuant to this Section 1(e) shall be used only for the purpose of paying or performing the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. 
 (iii) Nothing contained in this Section 1(e) shall in any way limit, impair or affect the rights, remedies and options of Administrative Agent or Lender under any of the Loan Documents.

 WHEREAS, Lender is not willing to make the Loan to Borrower unless Guarantor executes and delivers this Guaranty. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, as an inducement to Lender to make the Loan to Borrower, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows 
 1. Guaranty of Obligation . 
 (a) Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders) the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations as and when the same shall be due and payable, whether by lapse of time, by acceleration of maturity or otherwise. Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally covenants and agrees that it is fully and personally liable for the Guaranteed Obligations as a primary obligor as set forth herein. As used herein, the term Guaranteed Obligations means the payment of (i) the Required Equity (as defined in the Loan Agreement) pursuant to Section 5.1.14 of the Loan Agreement (ii) all Leasing Expenditures in excess of the aggregate Additional Advances allocated for Leasing Expenditures pursuant to the Loan Agreement (the Leasing Expenditures Guaranty provided , however , the maximum sum of such Leasing Expenditures Guaranty shall not exceed the sum of 9,600,000.00 (iii) the sum of the Required Pay Down, plus all other amounts due pursuant to Section 5.1.19 of the Loan Agreement, when required pursuant to Section 5.1.19 of the Loan Agreement and (iv) all amounts that are due and payable under the Master Lease. 
 (b) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the unpaid amount of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 , if not paid when due pursuant to this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents, shall, at Administrative Agent's election in its sole and absolute discretion, be deemed to be added to and form a part of the Debt for all purposes under the Loan Documents (it being agreed that neither Administrative Agent nor Lender shall be required to demonstrate that it has suffered a Loss in such amount in order to recover such amounts from Guarantor).

or the giving of any deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Property, and shall not be reduced or limited by any repayment of the Loan or by any amount bid by Administrative Agent in connection with any foreclosure under the Loan Documents. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty to pay to Administrative Agent the unpaid amount of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 are separate and distinct from any obligation of Borrower to repay the Debt, and that such obligation does not constitute a guaranty of the Loan or of any of Borrower's obligations with respect to the Loan except to the extent that such unpaid amount of the Guaranteed Obligations as described in this Section 1 are actually added to and form a part of the Debt as provided above.

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions on the Series C Preferred Units shall accrue whether or not the terms and provisions set forth in Section 4.9.C(ii) hereof at any time prohibit the current payment of distributions, whether or not the Company has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such distributions, and whether or not such distributions are authorized or declared.

 (ii) If, upon any such Series C Preferred Liquidation Event, the available assets of the Company are insufficient to pay the full amount of the Series C Preferred Liquidation Preference on all outstanding Series C Preferred Units, then the holders of the Series C Preferred Units shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full Series C Preferred Liquidation Preference to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.

ARTICLE VI ALLOCATIONS 
 Section 6.1 Allocations for Capital Account Purposes 
 For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Members among themselves, the Member s items of income, gain, loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Exhibit B shall be allocated among the Members in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided herein below. 
 A. Net Income . After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit C of this Agreement, Net Income shall be allocated 
 (1) first, to the Managing Member until the cumulative Net Income allocated under this clause (1) equals the cumulative Net Losses allocated to the Managing Member under Section 6.1.B(6) 
 (2) second, to each DRO Member until the cumulative Net Income allocated to such DRO Member under this clause (2) equals the cumulative Net Losses allocated to such DRO Member under Section 6.1.B(5) (and among the DRO Members, pro rata in proportion to their respective percentages of the cumulative Net Losses allocated to all DRO Members pursuant to Section 6.1.B(5) hereof)

 (6) finally, with respect to Interests that are not entitled to any preference in distribution or with respect to which distributions are not limited to any preference in distribution, including the Common Units, among the classes of such Interests in a manner that reflects the relative terms of such classes (as reasonably determined by the Managing Member) (and, within each such class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests of such class as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is being made). 
 B. Net Losses . After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit C , Net Losses shall be allocated 
 38 

(1) first, to the holders of Interests, in proportion to, and to the extent that, their share of the Net Income previously allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.A(6) exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the sum of (a) distributions with respect to such Interests pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.1.B and (b) Net Losses allocated under this clause (1) 
 (2) second, with respect to classes of Interests that are not entitled to any preference in distribution upon liquidation of such class, pro rata to each such class in accordance with the terms of such class (and, within such class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is being made) provided, however, that Net Losses shall not be allocated to any Member pursuant to this Section 6.1.B(2) to the extent that such allocation would cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) (determined in each case (i) by not including in the Members Adjusted Capital Accounts any amount that a Member is obligated to contribute to the Company with respect to any deficit in its Capital Account pursuant to Section 13.3 and (ii) in the case of a Member who also holds classes of Interests that are entitled to any preferences in distribution upon liquidation, by subtracting from such Members Adjusted Capital Account the amount of such preferred distribution to be made upon liquidation) at the end of such taxable year (or portion thereof) 
 (3) third, with respect to classes of Interests that are entitled to any preference in distribution upon liquidation, in reverse order of the priorities of each such class (and within each such class, pro rata in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is being made) provided, however, that Net Losses shall not be allocated to any Member pursuant to this Section 6.1.B(3) to the extent that such allocation would cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) (determined in each case by not including in the Members Adjusted Capital Accounts any amount that a Member is obligated to contribute to the Company with respect to any deficit in its Capital Account pursuant to Section 13.3 at the end of such taxable year (or portion thereof)

 (5) fifth, to and among the DRO Members, in proportion to their respective DRO Amounts, until such time as the DRO Members as a group have been allocated cumulative Net Losses pursuant to this clause (4) equal to the Aggregate DRO Amount and 
 (6) thereafter, to the Managing Member. 
 C. Allocation of Nonrecourse Debt . For purposes of Regulation Section 1.752-3(a), the Members agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Company in excess of the sum of (i) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain and (ii) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated by the Managing Member by taking into account facts and circumstances relating to each Member s respective interest in the profits of the Company. For this purpose, the Managing Member shall have the sole and absolute discretion in any Fiscal Year to allocate such excess Nonrecourse Liabilities among the Members in any manner permitted under Code Section 752 and the Regulations thereunder. 
 39 

D. Recapture Income . Any gain allocated to the Members upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Company asset shall, to the extent possible after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to Exhibit C , be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such Members have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income. 
 E. Special Allocations Regarding LTIP Units . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1.A , Liquidating Gains shall first be allocated to the LTIP Unitholders until their Economic Capital Account Balances to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units are equal to (i) the Class A Unit Economic Balance multiplied by (ii) the number of their LTIP Units. For this purpose, Liquidating Gains means net gains that are or would be realized in connection with the actual or hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, including but not limited to net capital gain realized in connection with an adjustment to the value of Company assets under Section 704(b) of the Code made pursuant to Section 1.D of Exhibit B of the Agreement. The Economic Capital Account Balances of the LTIP Unitholders will be equal to their Capital Account balances to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units. Similarly, the Class A Unit Economic Balance shall mean (i) the Capital Account balance of the Managing Member Entity, plus the amount of the Managing Member s share of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to the Managing Member Entity s ownership of Class A Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations through the date on which any allocation is made under this Section 6.1.E , but prior to the realization of any Liquidating Gains, divided by (ii) the number of the Managing Member Entity s Class A Units. Any such allocations shall be made among the LTIP Unitholders whose LTIP Units are designated Class A Units in proportion to the amounts required to be allocated to each under this Section 6.1.E . The parties agree that the intent of this Section 6.1.E is to make the Capital Account balance associated with each LTIP Unit to be economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance associated with the Managing Member Entity s Class A Units (on a per-Unit basis), provided that Liquidating Gains are of a sufficient magnitude to do so upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or upon an adjustment to the Members Capital Accounts pursuant to Section 1.D of Exhibit B . To the extent the LTIP Unitholders receive a distribution in excess of their Capital Accounts, such distribution will be a guaranteed payment under Section 707(c) of the Code. 
 F. Special Allocations in Connection with a Liquidity Event . The Members intend that the allocation of Net Income, Net Losses and other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit required to be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Members pursuant to this Agreement will result in final Capital Account balances that will permit the amount each Member is entitled to receive upon liquidation of the Company (within the meaning of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Treasury Regulations) to equal the amount such Member would have received if such amount was distributable solely pursuant to the priorities set forth in Article IV , Article V and Section 13.2.A(1) (7) (assuming, for this purpose, that distributions under Section 13.2.A(7) are made to the Members (other than the Members holding Class B Units) in accordance with Sections 5.1.B(ii)(B) , 5.1.C and 5.1.F (and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any applicable DRO Amounts). Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1.A , in the taxable year of the event precipitating a Liquidity Event and thereafter, appropriate adjustments to allocations of Net Income and Net Losses to the Members shall be made to achieve such result. 
 Section 6.2 Revisions to Allocations to Reflect Issuance of Interests 
 If the Company issues Units or other Interests to any Member or any Additional Member pursuant to Article IV hereof, the Managing Member shall make such revisions to this Article VI and the Member Registry in the books and records of the Company as it deems necessary to 
 40 

reflect the terms of the issuance of such Units or Interests, including making preferential allocations to classes of Units or Interests that are entitled thereto. Such revisions shall not require the consent or approval of any other Member.

The termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a rebuttable presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section 7.7.A with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Company, and any insurance proceeds from the liability policy covering the Managing Member and any Indemnitee, and no Member shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital of the Company or otherwise provide funds to enable the Company to fund its obligations under this Section 7.7 .

 E. No Personal Liability for Members . In no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Members to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. 
 F. Interested Transactions .

 G. Benefit . The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their employees, officers, directors, trustees, heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

All third party costs and expenses incurred by the tax matters partner or partnership representative, as applicable, in performing its duties as such (including legal and accounting fees and expenses) shall be borne by the Company. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the Company from engaging an accounting firm and or law firm to assist the tax matters partner or partnership representative, as applicable, in discharging its duties hereunder, so long as the compensation paid by the Company for such services is reasonable. Each Member hereby agrees to reimburse the Company from and against any imputed underpayment liability of the Company under Section 6225 of the Code that is the result of adjustments to the Member s distributive share of Company items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit for a Company taxable year, including, but not limited to any interest, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to any such item or share.

Any amounts withheld pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having been distributed or otherwise paid to such Non-Managing Member. Each Non-Managing Member hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Company a security interest in such Non Managing Member s Interests to secure such Non-Managing Member s obligation to pay to the Company any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 10.5 . If a Non-Managing Member fails to pay any amounts owed to the Company pursuant to this Section 10.5 when due, the Managing Member may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to make the payment to the Company on behalf of such defaulting Non-Managing Member, and in such event shall be deemed to have loaned such amount to such defaulting Non-Managing Member and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Company as against such defaulting Non-Managing Member (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions). Any amounts payable by a Non-Managing Member hereunder shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, plus four (4) percentage points (but not higher than the maximum rate that may be charged under law) from the date such amount is due (i.e., fifteen (15) days after demand) until such amount is paid in full.

Solely for purposes of making such allocations, each of such items for the calendar month in which the transfer or redemption occurs shall be allocated to the Person who is a Member as of midnight on the last day of said month.

 68 

separate and apart from all other components of an Interest (iv) if in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company there is a significant risk that such transfer would cause a termination of the Company for U.S. federal or state income tax purposes (except as a result of the redemption or exchange for Shares of all Units held by all Non-Managing Members other than the Managing Member, the Managing Member Entity, or any Subsidiary of either, or pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under Section 7.11B or Section 11.2 (v) if in the opinion of counsel to the Company, there is a significant risk that such transfer would cause the Company to cease to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes (except as a result of the redemption or exchange for Shares of all Units held by all Non-Managing Members other than the Managing Member, the Managing Member Entity or any Subsidiary of either, or pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under Section 7.11B or Section 11.2 (vi) if such transfer requires the registration of such Interest pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities laws (vii) if such transfer is effectuated through an established securities market or a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder or such transfer causes the Company to become a publicly traded partnership, as such term is defined in Section 469(k)(2) or Section 7704(b) of the Code (provided, however, that, this clause (vii) shall not be the basis for limiting or restricting in any manner the exercise of the Redemption Right under Section 8.6 unless, and only to the extent that, outside tax counsel provides to the Managing Member an opinion to the effect that, in the absence of such limitation or restriction, there is a significant risk that the Company will be treated as a publicly traded partnership and, by reason thereof, taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (viii) if such transfer subjects the Company or the activities of the Company to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or ERISA, each as amended (ix) if such transfer could adversely affect the ability of the Managing Member Entity to remain qualified as a REIT or (x) if in the opinion of legal counsel for the transferring Member (which opinion and counsel shall be reasonable satisfactory to the Company) or legal counsel for the Company, there is a risk that such transfer would cause the Managing Member Entity to fail to remain qualified as a REIT or subject the Managing Member Entity to any additional taxes under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code. 
 F. Avoidance of Publicly Traded Partnership Status . The Managing Member shall monitor the transfers of interests in the Company to determine (i) if such interests are being traded on an established securities market or a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code and (ii) whether additional transfers of interests would result in the Company being unable to qualify for at least one of the safe harbors set forth in Regulations Section 1.7704-1 (or such other guidance subsequently published by the IRS setting forth safe harbors under which interests will not be treated as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code) (the Safe Harbors ). The Managing Member shall take all steps reasonably necessary or appropriate to prevent any trading of interests or any recognition by the Company of transfers made on such markets and, except as otherwise provided herein, to insure that at least one of the Safe Harbors is met provided, however, that the foregoing shall not authorize the Managing Member to limit or restrict in any manner the right of any holder of a Unit to exercise the Redemption Right in accordance with the terms of Section 8.6 unless, and only to the extent that, outside tax counsel provides to the Managing Member an opinion to the effect that, in the absence of such limitation or restriction, there is a significant risk that the Company will be treated as a publicly traded partnership and, by reason thereof, taxable as a corporation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Managing Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and allocations for all Fiscal Years of the Company or portions thereof, including the year during which such liquidation occurs), the Managing Member shall contribute to the capital of the Company the amount necessary to restore such deficit balance to zero in compliance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3) (ii) if a DRO Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and allocations for all Fiscal Years of the Company or portions thereof, including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such DRO Member shall be obligated to make a contribution to the Company with respect to any such deficit balance in such DRO Member s Capital Account upon a liquidation of the Company in an amount equal to the lesser of such deficit balance or such DRO Member s DRO Amount and (iii) the first sentence of this Section 13.3.B shall not apply with respect to any other Member to the extent, but only to such extent, that such Member previously has agreed in writing, with the consent of the Managing Member, to undertake an express obligation to restore all or any portion of a deficit that may exist in its Capital Account upon a liquidation of the Company. No Non-Managing Member shall have any right to become a DRO Member, to increase its DRO Amount, or otherwise agree to restore any portion of any deficit that may exist in its Capital Account without the express written consent of the Managing Member, in its sole and absolute discretion. Any contribution required of a Member under this Section 13.3.B shall be made on or before the later of (i) the end of the Fiscal Year of the Company in which the interest is liquidated or (ii) the ninetieth (90th) day following the date of such liquidation. The proceeds of any contribution to the Company made by a DRO Member with respect to a deficit in such DRO Member s Capital Account balance shall be treated as a Capital Contribution by such DRO Member and the proceeds thereof shall be treated as assets of the Company to be applied as set forth in Section 13.2.A . 
 C. Restoration of Deficit Capital Accounts upon a Liquidation of a Member s Interest by Transfer . If a DRO Member s interest in the Company is liquidated within the 
 73 

meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) (other than in connection with a liquidation of the Company) which term shall include a redemption by the Company of such DRO Member s interest upon exercise of the Redemption Right, and such DRO Member is designated on Exhibit E as a Part II DRO Member, such DRO Member shall be required to contribute cash to the Company equal to the lesser of (i) the amount required to increase its Capital Account balance as of such date to zero, or (ii) such DRO Member s DRO Amount. For this purpose, (i) the DRO Member s deficit Capital Account balance shall be determined by taking into account all contributions, distributions, and allocations for the portion of the Fiscal Year of the Company ending on the date of the liquidation or redemption, and (ii) solely for purposes of determining such DRO Member s Capital Account balance, the Managing Member shall redetermine the Carrying Value of the Company s assets on such date based upon the principles set forth in Sections 1.D.(3) and (4) of Exhibit B hereto, and shall take into account the DRO Member s allocable share of any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss resulting from such redetermination in determining the balance of its Capital Account. The amount of any payment required hereunder shall be due and payable within the time period specified in the second to last sentence of Section 13.3.B . 
 D. Effect of the Death of a DRO Member . After the death of a DRO Member who is an individual, the executor of the estate of such DRO Member may elect to reduce (or eliminate) the DRO Amount of such DRO Member. Such elections may be made by such executor by delivering to the Managing Member within two hundred and seventy (270) days of the death of such Non-Managing Member, a written notice setting forth the maximum deficit balance in its Capital Account that such executor agrees to restore under this Section 13.3 , if any. If such executor does not make a timely election pursuant to this Section 13.3 (whether or not the balance in the applicable Capital Account is negative at such time), then the DRO Member s estate (and the beneficiaries thereof who receive distributions of Interests therefrom) shall be deemed a DRO Member with a DRO Amount in the same amount as the deceased DRO Member. Any DRO Member which itself is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may likewise elect, after the date of its partner s death to reduce (or eliminate) its DRO Amount by delivering a similar notice to the Managing Member within the time period specified above, and in the absence of any such notice the DRO Amount of such DRO Member shall not be reduced to reflect the death of any of its partners. 
 Section 13.4 Rights of Non-Managing Members 
 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Non-Managing Member shall look solely to the assets of the Company for the return of its Capital Contributions and shall have no right or power to demand or receive property other than cash from the Company. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Non-Managing Member shall have priority over any other Non-Managing Member as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions, or allocations. 
 Section 13.5 Notice of Dissolution 
 If a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but for provisions of an election or objection by one or more Members pursuant to Section 13.1 , result in a dissolution of the Company, the Managing Member shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written notice thereof to each of the Members and to all other parties with whom the Company regularly conducts business (as determined in the discretion of the Managing Member). 
 Section 13.6 Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Liability Company 
 Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Company cash and property as provided in Section 13.2 , the Company shall be terminated and the Certificate of Formation and all 
 74 

qualifications of the Company as a foreign limited liability company in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company shall be taken. 
 Section 13.7 Reasonable Time for Winding Up 
 A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to Section 13.2 , to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding-up, and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect among the Members during the period of liquidation. 
 Section 13.8 Waiver of Partition 
 Each Member hereby waives any right to partition of the Company property. 
 Section 13.9 Liability of Liquidator
