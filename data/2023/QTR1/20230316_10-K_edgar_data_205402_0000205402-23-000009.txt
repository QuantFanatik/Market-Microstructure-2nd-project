EXPLANATORY NOTE 

The Annual Report Relating to Voting Trust Interests, filed by the Voting Trustees under a Voting Trust Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2017 (the "Voting Trust Agreement"), among the Voting Trustees, participating holders of the Common Stock of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. ("Graybar" or the "Company") and Graybar was filed for years prior to 1982 on Form 16-K, which was discontinued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-18524, effective May 24, 1982 (the "Release"). In the Release, the Commission indicated that although Form 16-K was being discontinued, voting trusts would continue to be required to file annual reports. Specific requirements respecting the form of such annual reports were to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 

In response to inquiries to the Deputy Chief Counsel of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance, Graybar has been informed that the Voting Trustees should file an Annual Report on Form 10-K (as the only appropriate form under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), but that because the requirements of Form 10-K are generally not applicable to elicit information relevant to voting trusts, the information previously required by rescinded Form 16-K should continue to be provided in this Annual Report. For this reason, the item numbers and information in this Annual Report correspond to the item numbers and disclosure required in the past by rescinded Form 16-K and used in the Annual Report Relating to Voting Trust Interests filed with the Commission by voting trustees in years prior to 1982.
