The Company's management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows 
 
 Platform Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ). 
 
 Period The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 
 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except as set forth in the column titled Not Applicable to Platform in Appendix l attached hereto. 
 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company's management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the servicing criterion. The Company's management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1 lOl(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company's management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C&DI 200.06 ). The Company's management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company's management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendor and related servicing criterion. 
 
 With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

1. The Company's management is responsible for assessing the Company's compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 
 2. The Company ' s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above as of and for the Period.

As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the Company's responsibility for criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. 
 
 4. Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors of Pacific Gas and Electric Company 
 
 We have examined management of Pacific Gas and Electric Company s assertion, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Pacific Gas and Electric (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the Senior Secured Recovery Bonds, Series 2021-A and Series 2022-A of PG&E Recovery Funding LLC (the Platform ), excluding criteria Items 1122(d)(2)(ii)(outsourcing), 1122(d)(iii)(back-up servicing), 1122(d)(1)(iv)(fidelity bond), 1122(d)(2)(iii)(advances of funds or guarantees), 1122(d)(2)(vi)(unissued checks), 1122(d)(3)(ii)(amounts allocated and remitted), 1122(d)(4)(iii)(additions, removals or substitutions), 1122(d)(4)(v)(pool assets), 1122(d)(4)(ix)(adjustments to interest rates), 1122(d)(4)(xi) (payments on behalf of obligors), 1122(d)(4)(xii)(late payment penalties), 1122(d)(4)(xiii)(obligor disbursements), and 1122(d)(4)(xv)(external credit enhancement)(the servicing criteria as of and for the period January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 for Series 2021-A and as of and for the period November 30, 2022 through December 31, 2022 for Series 2022-A, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management's assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for Series 2021-A and as of for the period November 30, 2022 through December 31, 2022 for Series 2022-A of PG&E Recovery LLC Senior Secured Recovery Bonds, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 The Board of Directors The Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. 
 
 We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management's Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria that The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent, or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1 )(iii), 1122( d)(1 )(iv), 1122(d)(1 )(v), 1122( d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4 )(iv), 1122( d)(4 )(v), 1122(d)(4 )(vi), 1122(d)(4 )(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4 )(ix), 1122(d)(4 )(x), 1122(d)(4 )(xi), 1122(d)(4 )(xii), 1122(d)(4 )(xiii), 1122(d)(4 )(xiv) and 1122( d)(4 )(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect to Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has determined that for certain transactions in the Platform the Truster (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Truster to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings identified by the Truster to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee's security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements). Management's Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria indicates that as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Truster to perform such activities, the Company's responsibility for Servicing Criterion 1122( d)(4 )(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management's Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our

 the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with 
 KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee . 

responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 As described in the accompanying Management's Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a 
 
 servicer'' as defined in Item 1101 U) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the Servicing Criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C&DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C&DI 200.06). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the Servicing Criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendor and related Servicing Criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
