contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement (the Transactions ), (i) each Selling Shareholder shall sell to the Company,
and the Company shall purchase from each Selling Shareholder, all of the issued and outstanding Graphjet Shares, as set forth opposite

entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting cast their votes and approved an amendment to the Trust Agreement (the Trust
Amendment Proposal ), pursuant to which the Trust Agreement was amended to extend the date on which Continental must liquidate
the Trust Account established in connection with the IPO if the Company has not completed its initial business combination, from November
18, 2022 to August 18, 2023 provided the Company deposits 0.045 per Energem public Class A ordinary share per month extended. 

Shareholders
of the Company also approved the Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association at the Extraordinary General Meeting,

Our
Business 

We
have specifically formed a preeminent management team and board of directors with significant experience to source, evaluate and execute
a merger with a company that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team. We believe that the
principal technologies and sectors with massive potential include: zero emission technologies in the in the renewable energy space. Applications
will only be limited by imagination. From a geographic standpoint, our target sectors are globally integrated, and we target to capture
opportunities high growth markets such as North America and Asia Pacific. 

Our
team is composed of seasoned industry leaders and experienced capital investors, and it has a robust network in our target industries
and significant experience in the sourcing, due diligence, acquisition and execution of strategic investments. Further, our team has
a global, demonstrated track-record of executing investments and managing follow-on growth in our target industries, with transaction
sizes ranging from the hundreds of millions to multiple billions. 

We
intend to partner with the management and owners of one or more high-quality companies seeking an alternative to a traditional initial
public offering IPO ). We will use our management team s significant venture capital and private equity experience
in sourcing transactions and due diligence to identify and negotiate a combination with an enduring business. The traditional IPO process
entails significant preparation, commitment of time and resources and entails meaningful uncertainty. As a result, management and owners
are searching for viable public market alternatives. We believe that the combined experience of our management, members of our Board
and our advisors, represents a compelling alternative combined with the potential for long-term value creation. 

We
see an increased focus on sustainability and impact during the countdown to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals UN SDGs by 2030. This focus is driving numerous attractive and high-growth commercial opportunities that can contribute to the solution of complex
global challenges such as zero emissions, industrial innovation, reduction of waste, and combating climate change. Indeed, environmental,
social and governance ESG investing continues to grow in significance with both institutional and retail investors, and
its alignment with consumer behavior continues to grow as well. 

We
have also observed that companies increasingly seek to become more mission-driven through the adoption of clear and transparent ESG frameworks.
Further, we are seeing that an emphasis on better outcomes for all stakeholders is increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage.
It is already well-evidenced that businesses with strong ESG practices can achieve attractive investment returns. In an era where more
and more people want to work for, buy from and invest in organizations that share their values, we believe companies that have a positive
impact on society and the planet will be better placed to succeed and grow sustainably. 

Our
team is comprised of seasoned industry leaders and experienced capital investors, and it has a robust network in our target industries
and significant experience in the sourcing, due diligence, acquisition and execution of strategic investments. Further, our team has
a global, demonstrated track record of executing investments and managing follow-on growth in our target industries, with transaction
sizes ranging from the hundreds of millions to multiple billions. 

Over
the course of their careers, our management team and Board have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that
we believe will serve as a useful source of opportunities. This network has been developed through both investing and operating experience
across a broad range of sectors, including diversified business services, technology, telecommunications, media and entertainment, pharmaceutical
and consumer healthcare, financial services and financial technology, consumer products, energy and power, real estate including real
estate services and related businesses, environmental services, mobility and electrification of the transportation industry and insurance
and insurance related services. We expect these networks will provide us with a robust flow of opportunities for a potential business
combination. 

We
have employed a pro-active acquisition strategy focused on identifying potential business combination targets, as seen with the Graphjet
Business Combination. We believe strongly in our management team s ability to add value from both an operating and a financing
perspective which has been a key driver of past performance and we believe will continue to be central to its differentiated acquisition
strategy. 

11 

Our
Business Strategy 

Our
investment strategy seeks to promote responsible and purposeful business standards, and focuses on the following three types of companies: 

Businesses
 that contribute scalable solutions in the renewable energy space, which have positive fundamental
 growth drivers that deliver attractive financial returns and measurable impact when considering
 ESG factors; 

Best-in-class
 businesses that benefit all stakeholders, where we can leverage our impact management expertise
 to maximize the companies positive impacts, build a stronger brand and value proposition,
 and drive financial return; and 

Businesses
 which do not currently have best-in-class impact management practices but where there is
 an opportunity to re-orient and transform currently negative aspects of business operations
 to generate positive outcomes; and in doing so, build a more sustainable and resilient business
 model with a more attractive, less risky and more future-proofed financial return. 

While
we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we believe our management and sponsors experience allows
us to evaluate targets that have the potential to accelerate financial value creation while also having a measurable net positive impact
on the environment and society outside of China and Hong Kong. 

Our
management team s efforts to seek a suitable business combination target will be complemented by the experience and network of
our Board of Directors. In addition, our management team and Board of Directors will utilize their extensive networks of seasoned industry
operators and advisors to help us identify potential targets and effect the initial business combination in a more efficient process.
We believe that our team and vision will make us an attractive partner for founders and owners in the industries in which we plan to
pursue business combination targets. 

Globally,
we are approaching a decisive moment for international efforts to tackle the climate crisis a great challenge of our times. The
number of countries that have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century or soon after continues to grow, but so do global greenhouse
gas emissions. This gap between rhetoric and action needs to close if we are to have a fighting chance of reaching net zero by 2050 and
limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 C. Doing so requires nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems
that underpin our economies. We are in a critical year at the start of a critical decade for these efforts. 

Our
business strategies will be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in the energy value chain
with an immediate plan to focus on South East Asia and the Asia Pacific Regions (outside of China and Hong Kong), specifically in the
oil and gas and other potential renewable energy business as well as other adjacent services, industrials, and technologies, and remaining
opportunities across the energy value chain, including select opportunities within the traditional power generation and energy production. 

We
believe that the way businesses and consumers operate, make decisions, and spend has forever been changed because of the pandemic. We
believe further that our relationships with a large pool of quality initial business combination targets looking for an opportunity to
create liquidity for current investors and currency to acquire other companies. This provides numerous opportunities, and we would be
well positioned given the difficulty in bridging technology and/or capital opportunities between the east and west. Further, we believe
that the management team and board member s extensive background, careers, reputations, and relationships in cross border business
experience gives us the insight and position to identify the ideal targets for a business combination that creates long-term opportunity
and value growth and to complete the business combination. 

Acquisition
Criteria 

Consistent
with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating
prospective targets, such as Graphjet, for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating
acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria
and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe: 

are
 fundamentally sound but that we believe can improve results by leveraging the transactional, financial, managerial and investment
 experience of our management team; 

12 

have
 high-quality and strategically located assets; 

have
 a de-risked asset base with meaningful free cash flow; 

can
 utilize the extensive networks and insights that our management team and have built in the energy value chain; 

are
 at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques,
 or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance; 

exhibit
 unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company s
 growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; 

have
 an attractive valuation at entry and conservative balance sheet to create resiliency across the commodity cycle; 

will
 offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. 

synergistic
 /strategic partnership with existing owner; 

clean
 slate with no or minimum legacy issues; 

offer
 growth potential knock-on opportunities; and 

strong
 focus on environmental, social and corporate governance ESG and sustainability. 

Potential
upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks. We
intend to spend significant time assessing a company s leadership and personnel and evaluating what we can do to augment or upgrade
the team over time if needed. We will seek to identify business that we believe exhibit unrecognized
value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company s growth strategy,
or that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review. These criteria are
not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the
extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. 

Our
Acquisition Process 

In
evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to determine a target company s
quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review will encompass, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed
document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with incumbent management and employees, inspection of facilities, consultations
with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers, and suppliers, as well as a review of operational, legal, and additional
information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company. We will also utilize our operational and capital
planning experience. 

We
expect to place significant emphasis on a business combination target s technology and intellectual property as part of our acquisition
evaluation process, consistent with the investment approach of our management team. This due diligence may include the engagement of
multiple technical experts across both industry and academia to review the technology, participation in joint due diligence meetings
with these technical experts and management, as well as detailed intellectual property due diligence, to determine the nature and quality
of a company s technology innovation. 

13 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors.
In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors,
we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of
FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Members
of our management team, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own founder shares and may own rights following
this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate
business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors, as well as our management
team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation
of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect
to such business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. 

Each
of our directors and officers presently has and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to
other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly,
if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or
she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or
directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

Status
as a Public Company 

We
believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as Graphjet. As an existing public
company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination.
In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares or other equity interests in the target business for
our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
See The Share Purchase Agreement above for more information regarding such exchange in the Share Purchase Agreement. Although
there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a
more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public
offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the
same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 

Furthermore,
once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the Graphjet Business Combination, the target business will have effectively
become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well
as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences.
Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management
incentives consistent with shareholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among
potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

Financial
Position 

With
funds available for an initial business combination presently in the amount of approximately 20,011,014.13 (as of March 23, 2023), we
offer a target business, such as Graphjet, a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth
of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our
share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the
consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to
use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business
combination. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints. 

14 

Effecting
our Initial Business Combination 

We
are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for
an indefinite period. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering
and the private placement of the private placement units, our share capital debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be
paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may
be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such
companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company
or a similar company with nominal operations. 

If
our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account
are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our public shares, we
may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing
our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital. 

We
may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the
proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws,
we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial
business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing
the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of
such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance,
or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

The
time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs
associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification
and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring
losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Sources
of Target Businesses 

We
receive proprietary transaction opportunities as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities
from the network built up by our management team and by the members of our Board. Target business candidates, such as Graphjet, have
been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private
equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they
think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering
and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements
with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements
will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing
officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the
type of transaction that it is). 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors.
In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors,
we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member
of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Furthermore, if we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be involved
in the process for considering and approving the transaction. 

15 

Each
of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations
to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required
to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business
combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he
or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject
to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. 

Lack
of Business Diversification 

For
an indefinite period after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the
future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple
entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the
risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification
may: 

subject
 us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the
 industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 

cause
 us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited
Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team 

Although
we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the Graphjet management team, when evaluating the desirability
of effecting our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Graphjet Business Combination is not consummated
and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct.
In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore,
the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any
certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business
combination, including the Graphjet Business Combination, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our
affairs after our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience
or knowledge relating to the operations of the target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors
will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following
a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent
management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional
managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Evaluation
of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq
rules require that we consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value
equal to at least 80 of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes,
if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). The fair market value of our initial business combination
will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as
discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses, or a valuation based on the financial
metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. 

In
evaluating a prospective target business, such as Graphjet, we have conducted and will continue conduct an extensive due diligence review
which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial
and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated
third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.

The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently
be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target
business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available
to otherwise complete a business combination. 

The
Energem Board retained Baker Tilly (Malaysia) to opine on the fairness of the proposed acquisition of 100 of the equity interests in
Graphjet for the Transaction Consideration of US 1.38 billion. Baker Tilly concluded that the fair market value of the entire equity
interest in Graphjet ranges from USD 2.20 billion to USD 2.65 billion using the Relative Valuation Approach RVA methodology
followed by the application of a fifty percent (50 Start-Up Discount to Graphjet s valuation. The Relative Valuation Approach
uses a relative valuation model, which is a business valuation method that compares a company s value to that of
its competitors or industry peers to assess the company s financial worth. The Energem Board relied on the Baker Tilly fairness
opinion regarding the fairness of the Transaction Consideration to acquire Graphjet. 

Shareholders
May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 

We
may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our second
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable
stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. 

Type of Transaction 
 Whether Share Approval is Required 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 No 
 
 Purchase of shares of target not involving a merger with the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of the company with a target 
 Yes 

Under
Nasdaq s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we
 issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than
 in a public offering); 

any
 of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons
 collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise
 and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power
 of 5 or more; or 

the
 issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

The
decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval
is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a
variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 

the
 timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either
 not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in
 other additional burdens on the Company; 

the
 expected cost of holding a shareholder vote; 

17 

the
 risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 

other
 time and budget constraints of the Company; and 

additional
 legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders. 

Ability
to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination 

The
shareholders of the Company approved the Company s Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association at the November
16, 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting, changing the structure and cost of the Company s right to extend the Termination Date by
which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, which we refer to as a business combination, (ii)
cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100 of the Company s common
shares included as part of the units sold in the Company s initial public offering that closed on November 18, 2021, which was
November 18, 2022 but was amended to extend the Termination Date by up to nine (9) one-month extensions to August 18, 2023 provided that
(i) the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional 0.045 per share for each
month until August 18, 2023, and (ii) compliance with the procedures relating to any such extension, as set forth in the Trust Agreement. 

Permitted
Purchases of Our Securities 

If
we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase
would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial
owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. If our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase
shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such
selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders,
officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without
the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange
Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of
purchases. 

The
purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2)
to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash
at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the
consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

As
a consequence of any such purchases, the public float of our public shares of Common Shares may be reduced and the number
of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities
on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination. 

Redemption
Rights for Public Shareholders upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination 

We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial
business combination, such as the Graphjet Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
subject to the limitations described herein. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of
our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive
liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required
period. 

18 

Manner
of Conducting Redemptions 

We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or
(ii) by means of a tender offer. We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business
combination. In such case, we will: 

conduct
 the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the
 Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender
 offer rules, and 

file
 proxy materials with the SEC. 

If
we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide
our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. If we submit
our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority
of the outstanding shares of ordinary shares present and entitled to vote at the meeting to approve the initial business combination
are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by
proxy of shares of outstanding ordinary shares of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of
ordinary shares of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our sponsor, officers, directors, and director nominees will count towards
this quorum. Our sponsor, officers, directors, and director nominees have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased
during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements
of our sponsor, officers, directors, and director nominees may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. 

Each
public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against, or abstain from voting on,
the proposed transaction or abstain from voting . Additionally,
each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction
or abstained from voting. Public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with
any extension of the period to complete our initial business combination. 

If,
however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder
approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 

conduct
 the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 

file
 tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial
 and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the
 Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon
the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with
Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to
comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem
will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted
to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned
on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender
more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

19 

Our
second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in
an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny
stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant
to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration
to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes
or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the
event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted
for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed
the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares
of our Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

Limitation
on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with
our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder
is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption
rights with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of
shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business
combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price
or on other undesirable terms. 

Absent
this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise
its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current
market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold
in this offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt
to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target
that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting
our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 

Tendering
Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

Public
shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation
or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
The Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder s option, in each case up to
two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the initial business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender
offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination
will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself
to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until
the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote on the initial business combination if we distribute
proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short
period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately 80.00 and it would be up to the
broker whether to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require holders
seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights
regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

20 

The
foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. To perfect redemption rights in connection with their
business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business
combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such
holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the Company would contact
such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had
an option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price
of the Company s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in
the open market before delivering his or her shares to the Company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders
were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of
the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery
prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination
is approved. 

Any
request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve
the initial business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate
in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such
rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated
that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the
completion of our initial business combination. 

If
our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their
redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case,
we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business
combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 12 months (or as
extended as provided in our registration statement) from the closing of this offering. Public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity
to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any extension of the period to complete our initial business combination. 

Redemption
of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 

Our
Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that we have up to nine (9) one-month Extensions to August
18, 2023, provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional 0.045
per share for each month, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our Second Amended and Restated Memorandum
and Articles of Association. If we are unable to complete our business combination by August 18, 2023 (or as otherwise extended), we
will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business
days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less
up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will
completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating
distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by August 18,
2023, in accordance with our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 

Our
sponsor, directors and each member of our management have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived
their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete an initial
business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination including with respect to any shares obtained through
the placement units. However, if our sponsor, directors or members of our management team acquire public shares, they will be entitled
to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination
within the period to consummate the initial business combination. 

21 

Our
sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment
to our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation
to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete
an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, unless we provide our public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to
the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously
released to us to pay our taxes, if any divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public
shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC s
 penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares
such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of
our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed
by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. 

We
expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be
funded from amounts held outside the trust account plus up to 100,000 of funds from the interest on the trust account available to us
to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 

If
we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering the sale of the placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.15. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure
you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than 10.15. Under Section 281(b)
of the Companies Act, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments
to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution
of our remaining assets to our shareholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds
sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target
businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute
such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including
but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the
enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds
held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account,
our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party
that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial
to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include
the engagement of a third-party consultant whose expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those
of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to
execute a waiver. 

22 

The
underwriters will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no
guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts
held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services
rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with
which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.15
per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust
account if less than 10.15 per unit, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be
withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target
business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

If
an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently
verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor s only
assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None
of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective
target businesses. 

In
the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) 10.15 per public share and (ii) the actual amount
per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than 10.15 per unit, due to
reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, and our
sponsor asserts that they are unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related
to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification
obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce
its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose
not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share
redemption price will not be less than 10.15 per unit. 

We
will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring
to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses
or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of
this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to the remaining proceeds
of this offering and the sale of the placement units with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred
in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately 25,000). 

If
we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received
funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount
of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. 

Under
the Companies Act, shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received
by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public shareholders upon the redemption of our
public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination
may be considered a liquidating distribution under Cayman Islands law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth
in Section 280 of the Companies Act intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day
notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation
may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to shareholders,
any liability of shareholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such shareholder s pro rata
share of the claim or the amount distributed to the shareholder, and any liability of the shareholder would be barred after the third
anniversary of the dissolution. 

23 

Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public shareholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, is not considered
a liquidating distribution under Cayman Islands law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the
imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section
174 of the Companies Act, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution,
instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the
period to consummate the initial business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay taxes and if needed, dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders 
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate,
subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month and, therefore,
we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent
of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our shareholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of
such date. 

Because
we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the Companies Act requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us
at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us
within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations
will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors
(such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained
in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with
which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the
trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood
that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to
the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.15 per public share or (ii) such lesser
amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value
of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under
our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. If an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. 

If
we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed,
the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy
estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims
deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return 10.15 per unit to our public shareholders. Additionally, if
we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed,
any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either
a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek
to recover some, or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its
fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive
damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that
claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our
public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares
if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, (ii) in connection
with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing
of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we
do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination or (B) with respect
to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares
for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection
with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon
the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination
within the period to consummate the initial business combination, with respect to such shares of our Class A ordinary shares so redeemed.
In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek
shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder s voting in connection with the initial
business combination alone will not result in a shareholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the
trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be
amended with a shareholder vote.

Competition 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as Graphjet, we may continue to encounter
competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups
and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities
are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover,
many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target
businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial
business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise
their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and
the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may
place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We
currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but
they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination.
The amount of time they will devote in any period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business
combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior
to the completion of our initial business combination. 

Periodic
Reporting and Financial Information 

We
have registered our Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement
that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual
reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

We
will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender
offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial
statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the
historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement
requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements
in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within
the prescribed time frame. 

25 

We
are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large-accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth
company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity
to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

We
have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing
a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or after the consummation of our initial business
combination. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such,
we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and
shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of
the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant
to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class
A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which
we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

All

strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report,

similar expressions, as they relate to us or the Company s management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company s
management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors
detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting

Overview 

The
Company is a blank check company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on August 6, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger,
share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company
intends to effectuate its initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement, the proceeds
of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and
debt. 

The
issuance of additional shares in connection with an initial business combination to the owners of the target or other investors: 

may
 significantly dilute the equity interest of investors, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class
 B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class
 B ordinary shares; 

29 

may
 subordinate the rights of holders of our ordinary shares if preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our
 ordinary shares; 

could
 cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our ordinary shares is issued, which may affect, among other things,
 our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
 and directors; 

may
 have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person
 seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may
 adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants. 

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: 

default
 and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt
 obligations; 

acceleration
 of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
 that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our
 immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our
 inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such
 financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our
 inability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares; 

using
 a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
 on our ordinary shares if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general
 corporate purposes; 

limitations
 on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased
 vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations
 on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution
 of our strategy; and 

other
 purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination plans. We cannot assure you that our
plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 

Special
Purchase Agreement 

On
August 1, 2022, the Company, entered into the Share Purchase Agreement with Graphjet, the Purchaser Representative, the Selling Shareholders
and the Shareholder Representative. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Company
will purchase 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of Graphjet for the Consideration Shares such that Graphjet will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. The Share Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties thereto
and the Closing is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Share Purchase Agreement. 

30 

Graphjet
 converts palm kernel shells to essential raw materials such as graphene and graphite used to produce
batteries in the electric vehicle space among other products. The aggregate value of the Consideration Shares to be paid pursuant
to the Share Purchase Agreement to the Selling Shareholders, as of immediately prior to the Closing, for the purchase of all issued and
outstanding Graphjet Shares, shall be that number of Energem Class A ordinary shares equal to (i) One Billion Three Hundred and Eighty
Million U.S. Dollars 1,380,000,000), minus (ii) the amount, if any, by which 30,000 i.e., the target net working capital amount)
exceeds the Net Working Capital Amount (but not less than zero) (as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement), minus (iii) the Closing
Net Indebtedness amount (as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement), minus (iv) the amount of any Transaction Expenses (as defined in
the Share Purchase Agreement), divided by ten dollars 10.00). 

Each
Selling Shareholder shall receive a number of Energem Class A ordinary shares equal to the aggregate Consideration Shares divided by
the number of Graphjet Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, multiplied by the number of Graphjet Shares held by such
Selling Shareholder. The total consideration payable to the Selling Shareholders in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement is also
referred to herein as the Transaction Consideration. 

The
Extraordinary General Meeting 

As
previously reported on Form 8-K, on November 16, 2022, the Company held an annual meeting via an Extraordinary General Meeting at which
the shareholders cast their votes and approved the Trust Amendment Proposal, pursuant to which the Trust Agreement was amended to extend
the date on which Continental must liquidate the Trust Account established in connection with the IPO if the Company has not completed
its initial business combination, from November 18, 2022 to August 18, 2023. 

At
the Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of
Association of the Company giving the Company the right to extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital
share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more
businesses, (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100 of the Company s
Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in the Company s IPO that closed on November 18, 2021 from November
18, 2022 by up to nine (9) one-month extensions to August 18, 2023. 

In
connection with approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, the Company caused 0.045 per outstanding
share of the Company s Class A ordinary shares, giving effect to the redemptions disclosed above, or approximately 85,297 for
the remaining 1,895,481 Class A ordinary shares to be deposited in the Trust Account in connection with the exercise of the first monthly
extension of the Extended Date on November 17, 2022 in advance of the November 18, 2022 due date. 

In
connection with the second monthly extension of the Termination Date, the Company caused 0.045 per outstanding share of the Company s
Class A ordinary shares or approximately 85,297 for 1,895,481 Class A ordinary shares to be paid to the Trust Account on December 15,
2022, in advance of the December 17, 2022 due date for the second monthly extension of the Termination Date. 

In
connection with the third monthly extension of the Termination Date, the Company caused 0.045 per outstanding share of Energem s
Class A ordinary shares or approximately 85,297 for 1,895,481 Class A ordinary shares to be paid to the Trust Account on January 13,
2022, in advance of the January 18, 2022 due date. 

In
connection with the fourth monthly extension of the Termination Date, the Company caused 0.045 per outstanding share of Energem s
Class A ordinary shares or approximately 85,297 for 1,895,481 Class A ordinary shares to be paid to the Trust Account on February 10,
2023, in advance of the February 18, 2023 due date. 

In
connection with the fifth monthly extension of the Termination Date, the Company caused 0.045 per outstanding share of Energem s
Class A ordinary shares or approximately 85,297 for 1,895,481 Class A ordinary shares to be paid to the Trust Account on March 10, 2023,
in advance of the March 18, 2023 due date to extend the period to consummate the period to complete a business combination to April 18,
2023. 

31 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from inception to December 31, 2022, were
organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not
expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We expect to generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on cash and marketable securities held after the IPO. We expect that we will incur increased expenses
as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence
expenses in connection with completing a business combination. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income of 53,884, which consists of formation and operating costs 1,294,712 and interest
earned on marketable securities hold in the trust account of 1,348,596. For the period from August 6, 2021, to December 31, 2021, we
had a net loss of 307,949 which consist of formation and operating costs of 309,298 and interest earned on marketable securities hold
in the trust account of 1,349. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
November 16, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of 10,000,000 units (the units c onsisting
of one Class A ordinary share and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share ),
at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000, and incurring offering costs of 6,738,148, of which 4,025,000 was for
deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 6). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000
units at the IPO price to cover over-allotments. Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated
the private placement of an aggregate of 475,575 units to the Sponsor, at a price of 10.00 per placement unit, generating total gross
proceeds of 4,755,750 (see Note 4).

November 18, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,500,000 units pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option. The
units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of 15,000,000. Also, in
connection with the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 52,500 placement units at a purchase
price of 10.00 per unit. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had available to us 47,789 of cash on our balance sheet and a working capital deficit of 723,893. We intend
to use the funds held outside of the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business
due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to
acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. The interest income earned on the investments in the
Trust Account are unavailable to fund operating expenses. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs
through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this period, the Company will be
using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial
Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

The
Company s Sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the
Company may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required
to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending
the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. 

On
August 6, 2021, Energem LLC, our sponsor, agreed to loan us up to an aggregate amount of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to
our IPO of our units. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 88,542 is outstanding under the promissory note. 

32 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We
have not entered any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or entered any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. Commencing on the date
of the prospectus and until completion of the Company s business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse Energem
LLC, the Sponsor, up to an amount of 10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support. 

The
underwriter is entitled to deferred commissions of 4,025,000 from the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. The deferred commissions
will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if we complete a Business Combination, subject
to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Following
the consummation of our IPO, the net proceeds of our IPO, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in U.S. government
treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in US treasuries.
Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate
risk.

9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

(1) 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
 assets of our company, 

(2) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
 with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

(3) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2022. In making these assessments,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, due to the material weakness in our internal controls due to inadequate
segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting,
IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. 

Management
intends to implement remediation steps to improve our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing the size and composition of our board upon the closing of the business and to identify
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the
requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented additional layers of reviews in the
financial close process. 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status
as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Number
and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

The
Energem Board consists of four members. Prior to our initial business combination, holders of Energem s Founder Shares have the
right to appoint all of our directors and remove members of the board of directors for any reason, and holders of Energem s Public
Shares and private placement shares do not have the right to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. These provisions
of our Energem M A may only be amended by a Special Resolution passed by the holders of at least 90 of the issued and outstanding
Energem Class B Ordinary Shares. Subject to any other special rights applicable to the shareholders, any vacancies on the Energem Board
may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and voting at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Energem
Board or by an Ordinary Resolution of the holders of Energem Ordinary Shares (or, prior to Energem s initial business combination,
an Ordinary Resolution of the holders of Founder Shares). 

Our
officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms
of office. Our board of directors is authorized to nominate persons to the offices set forth in our second amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide
that our officers may consist of one or more chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, president, chief financial
officer, vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

36 

Director
Independence 

The
Nasdaq listing rules require that a majority of the Energem Board be independent within one year of Energem s initial public offering.
An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries
or any other individual having a relationship with the company, which, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would
interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Energem
Board has determined that Kok Seong Wong, Doris Wong Sing Ee, and Kwang Fock Chong are independent directors under applicable SEC and
Nasdaq rules. Energem expects a majority of the Combined Entity s board of directors to be comprised of independent directors to
comply with the majority independent board requirement in Rule 5605(b) of the Nasdaq listing rules. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
board of directors have three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a corporate governance and nominating
committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the
audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception,
the rules of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. 

Audit
Committee 

We
have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Kok Seong Wong and Kwang Fock Chong
 serve as members of our audit committee. Our board of directors has determined that each of Kok
Seong Wong and Kwang Fock Chong meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1)
of the Exchange Act. Kwang Fock Chong serves as the chairman of the audit committee. Each
member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that each qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details
the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

appointing,
 compensating and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm; 
 
 reviewing
 and approving the annual audit plan for the Company; 
 
 overseeing
 the integrity of our financial statements and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; 
 
 discussing
 the annual audited financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements with
 management and the independent registered public accounting firm; 
 
 pre-approving
 all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered
 public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed; 
 
 appointing
 or replacing the independent registered public accounting firm; 
 
 establishing
 procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints (including anonymous complaints)
 we receive concerning accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing matters or potential
 violations of law; 
 
 monitoring
 our environmental sustainability and governance practices; 
 
 establishing
 procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding
 accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding
 our financial statements or accounting policies; 
 
 approving
 audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm; 
 
 discussing
 earnings press releases and financial information provided to analysts and rating agencies; 
 
 discussing
 with management our policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management; 
 
 reviewing
 any material transaction between our Chief Financial Officer that has been approved in accordance
 with our Code of Ethics for our officers, and providing prior written approval of any material
 transaction between us and our President; and 
 
 producing
 an annual report for inclusion in our proxy statement, in accordance with applicable rules
 and regulations. 

37 

The
audit committee is a separately designated standing committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. 

Compensation
Committee 

We
have established a compensation committee of our board of directors. The members of our compensation committee are Kok Seong Wong and
Kwang Fock Chong. Mr. Kok Seong Wong serves as chairman of the compensation committee. Under Nasdaq listing standards and governance
rules and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent
directors. Our board of directors has determined that each of Kok Seong Wong and Kwang Fock Chong is independent. We adopted a compensation
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing
 and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to our President s compensation,
 evaluating our President s performance in light of those goals and objectives, and
 setting our President s compensation level based on this evaluation; 
 
 setting
 salaries and approving incentive compensation and equity awards, as well as compensation
 policies, for all other officers who file reports of their ownership, and changes in ownership,
 of the Company s ordinary shares under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the Section
 16 Officers ), as designated by our board of directors; 
 
 making
 recommendations to the board of directors with respect to incentive compensation programs
 and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval; 
 
 approving
 any employment or severance agreements with our Section 16 Officers; 
 
 granting
 any awards under equity compensation plans and annual bonus plans to our President and the
 Section 16 Officers; 
 
 approving
 the compensation of our directors; and 
 
 producing
 an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in our proxy statement, in accordance
 with applicable rules and regulations. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to an affiliate of our sponsor, of 10,000 per month, for office space, utilities
and secretarial and administrative support, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be
paid to any of our existing shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation
of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation
arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such
adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the
compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None
of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity
that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. 

Guidelines
for Selecting Director Nominees 

The
guidelines for selecting nominees, which we have specified in our charter adopted by us, generally provide that potential candidate nominations: 

should
 possess personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and reputation in the business
 community; 
 
 should
 have current knowledge and contacts in the communities in which we do business and, in our
 industry, or other industries relevant to our business; 

38 

should
 have the ability and willingness to commit adequate time to the board of directors and committee
 matters; 
 
 should
 demonstrate ability and willingness to commit adequate time to the board of directors and
 committee matters; 
 
 should
 possess the fit of the individual s skills and personality with those of other directors
 and potential directors in building a board of directors that is effective, collegial and
 responsive to our needs; and 
 
 should
 demonstrate diversity of viewpoints, background, experience, and other demographics, and
 all aspects of diversity in order to enable the board of directors to perform its duties
 and responsibilities effectively, including candidates with a diversity of age, gender, nationality,
 race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. 

Each
year in connection with the nomination of candidates for election to the board of directors, the corporate governance and nominating
committee will evaluate the background of each candidate, including candidates that may be submitted by our shareholders. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our
audit committee charter with the SEC. You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site
at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose
any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation. 

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis 

The
following disclosure concerns the compensation of the Company s officers and directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 i.e., pre-Business Combination). 

None
of our executive officers or directors have received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. In addition, our sponsor, executive
officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or
our or their respective affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside
the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls
in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with our activities on our behalf in connection with identifying and completing an initial business combination. 

In
addition, on September 7, 2021, our sponsor transferred 5,000 ordinary shares to Cu Seng Kiu, our Chief Financial Officer, and 2,500
ordinary shares to each of Li Sin Tan, our former independent director, Kok Seong Wong and Chong Kwang Fock at
their original purchase price pursuant to executed securities assignment agreements. Following Ms. Tan s resignation, the
sponsor transferred the 2,500 ordinary shares owned by Ms. Tan to Ms. Doris Wong Sing Ee, our Executive Director. The founder shares
will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation
of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid by the Company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination. 

39 

After
the completion of our initial business combination, such as the Graphjet Business Combination, members of our management team who remain
with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders,
to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with
a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company
to our members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination
because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation.
Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination,
either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board
of directors. 

We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the completion
of our initial business combination, although some of our executive officers and directors have negotiated employment or consulting arrangements
to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of these employment or consulting arrangements to retain
their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe
that the ability of our management to remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination will be a determining factor
in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and
directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. 

The
compensation committee has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based upon its review
and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included
in this Report. 

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters. 

The
following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of March 30, 2023, based
on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of ordinary shares, by: 

each
 person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding shares of ordinary shares; 

each
 of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns shares of ordinary shares; and 

all
 our executive officers and directors as a group. 

In
the table below, percentage ownership is based on 5,298,556 of our ordinary shares, consisting of (i) 2,423,556 shares of Class A ordinary
shares, par value 0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding (including 1,895,481 shares subject to possible redemption), and (ii) 2,875,000
shares of our Class B ordinary shares, issued and outstanding as of March 30, 2023. On all matters to be voted upon, except for the election
of directors of the board, holders of the shares of Class A ordinary shares and shares of Class B ordinary shares vote together as a
single class. Currently, all of the shares of Class B ordinary shares are convertible into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. 

Unless
otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
of ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement
warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

On
August 16, 2021, our sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per unit, for the purchase of 2,875,000 founder shares,
par value 0.0001. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent
approximately 20 of the outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of the IPO (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). 

The
founder shares (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions,
be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. On September 7, 2021, our sponsor transferred 5,000 ordinary shares to Cu Seng Kiu, our
Chief Financial Officer, and 2,500 ordinary shares to each of Li Sin Tan, our former independent director, Kok Seong Wong and Chong Kwang
Fock at their original purchase price pursuant to executed securities assignment agreements. Following Ms. Tan s resignation, the
sponsor transferred the 2,500 ordinary shares owned by Ms. Tan to Ms. Doris Wong Sing Ee, our Executive Director. As a result, our sponsor
currently owns 2,862,500 founder shares. 

41 

Our
sponsor purchased 528,075 placement units for a purchase price of 10.00 per unit in a private placement that occurred simultaneously
with the closing of our IPO. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to the
founder shares, placement shares or placement warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business combination by
August 18, 2023 (unless if extended). Commencing on the date of the IPO, we agreed to pay to Energem LLC, our sponsor, 10,000 per month
for up to 18 months for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination
or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

No
compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan,
will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our sponsor, officers or directors prior to, or in connection
with any services rendered to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our
behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee
will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will
determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

In
addition, to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
CEO or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest-bearing basis as may be required.
If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. If the initial business combination does not close,
we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit
at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units.
Other than as described above, the terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our CEO as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. We expect our
primary liquidity requirements to include approximately 287,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence,
travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; 60,000 for legal
and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; 180,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support; 253,000 for Director and Officer liability insurance premiums; and approximately 20,000 for working capital that will be used
for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. 

After
our initial business combination, such as the Graphjet Merger, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting,
management, or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent
then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount
of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting
held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business
to determine executive and director compensation. 

The
holders of the founder shares, representative shares, placement units, and units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital
loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) have (or will have) registration rights to require us to
register a sale of any of our securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed on January 13, 2022. These
holders are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale
under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have piggy-back registration rights to include their securities in
other registration statements filed by us. 

We
have entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification
provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any
officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such
indemnification. We have purchased a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and
directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations
to indemnify our officers and directors. 

42 

Registration
Rights 

We
have entered into the IPO Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units, the shares of common
stock and Private Placement Rights underlying the Private Placement Units, and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
the Private Placement Rights. Pursuant to the IPO Registration Rights Agreement, the Company Restricted Shareholders and their permitted
transferees can demand that we register the Founder Shares. Holders of our Private Placement Units and their permitted transferees can
demand that we register the Private Placement Units, the shares of common stock and Private Placement Rights underlying the Private Placement
Units, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Rights. The holders of these securities are entitled
to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain
 piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed after the consummation of the initial business
combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Office
Space and Related Support Services 

The
Company agreed, commencing on the date the Company Units are first listed on the Nasdaq, to pay the Sponsor, or an affiliate thereof,
a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support for up to 18 months. Upon completion
of the Company s initial business combination or the Company s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.
The Company incurred 110,000 in fees related to this service during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Related
Party Loans 

To
finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. Such working capital loans would be
evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s
discretion, up to 1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of 10.00
per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. If a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use
a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay any working capital loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would
be used to repay the working capital loans. As of December 31, 2022, there were no working capital loans outstanding. 

On
April 16, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate
principal amount of 300,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the Company s initial public offering. The note, as amended,
was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2022, or (ii) the consummation of the Company s initial public
offering. The Company borrowed 88,542 under the promissory note as of December 31, 2022. 

Founders 
Letter Agreement 

On
January 10, 2022, the Company, the Sponsor, and each of the Company Restricted Shareholders entered into a letter agreement, pursuant
to which, each Company Restricted Shareholder party thereto agreed to waive certain of their redemption rights, transfer rights and liquidation
rights with respect to their Founder Shares subject to the conditions set forth therein. Additionally, the Company Restricted Shareholders
parties thereto agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock they may own. The Company Restricted
Shareholders agreed (i) to vote their Founder Shares in favor of the adoption of any proposed business combination and the accompanying
transaction and (ii) if the Company engages in a tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination, to not seek to sell
any shares of common stock to the Company in connection with such tender offer. Additionally, each Company Restricted Shareholder party
thereto has agreed to certain standstill obligations, in each case on terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 

The
letter agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (x) the expiration of the Lock-Up periods or (y) the liquidation of the
Company.

Shareholder
Communications 

Shareholders
and interested parties may communicate with the Company s Board, any committee chairperson or the non-management directors as a
group by writing to the Company s Board or committee chairperson at Energem Corp., a t Level
3, Tower 11, Avenue 5, No. 8, Jalan Kerinchi, Bangsar South, 59200 Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and
our telephone number is + (60) 3270 47622 (if sent before the Business Combination) or with the board of directors or any committee
chairperson or the non-management directors as a group, Unit No. L4-E-8, Enterprise 4, Technology Park Malaysia, 5700 Bukit Jalil, Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia (if sent after the Business Combination). Each communication will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, to
the applicable board, the appropriate committee chairperson or all non-management directors. 

Director
Independence 

Nasdaq
listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined
generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We expect that our board of directors will
determine that Kok Seong Wong and Kwang Fock Chong are independent directors, 
as defined in Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules prior to completion of this offering.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Energem Corp. Opinion on the Financial Statements: 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Energem Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements
of operations, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period of August 6,
2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period of August
6, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 

U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have
a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable
on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing of a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company
will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting
securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect
a Business Combination.

however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company
decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its founder shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to
redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder
or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.

holders of the founder shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the founder shares and Public Shares held
by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims
by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) such
lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 
per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn
to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account
and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, if an executed waiver
is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party
claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors
by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective
target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As

consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of from the Sponsor to cover for certain offering
costs on the Company s behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder shares (as defined in Note 4). After the consummation of the
Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial
Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, to finance transaction costs in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may,
but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 4). As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts
outstanding under any Working Capital Loan. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs
through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this period, the Company will be
using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial
Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company
is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the Initial
Public Offering, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve
raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The balance sheet does not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management has determined that the Company has funds that are sufficient to fund the working
capital needs of the Company until the consummation of an initial business combination or the winding up of the Company as stipulated
in the Company s amended and restated memorandum of association. The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED 

As
of December 31, 2022, Energem Corp. we, our, us or the Company had the following
three classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ):
(i) its units, consisting of one Class A ordinary share (as defined below), one redeemable warrant (as defined below), with each whole
warrant (as defined below) entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share (the units ), (ii) its Class
A ordinary shares, 0.0001 par value per share Class A ordinary shares ), and (iii) its public warrants, with each whole
warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share for 11.50 per share (the warrants ). 

Pursuant
to our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our authorized ordinary shares consists of 500,000,000 shares
including 479,000,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares, 0.0001 par value and 20,000,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares, 0.0001
par value, and 1,000,000 undesignated preferred shares, 0.0001 par value. The following description summarizes the material terms of
our ordinary shares and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our second
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our bylaws and our warrant agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference
as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Report of which this Exhibit
4.5 is a part. 

Defined
terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Report. 

Units 

Each
consists of one Class A ordinary share and one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of ordinary
shares. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise his, her or its warrants only for a whole number of shares of
ordinary shares. 

Class
A Ordinary shares 

Ordinary
shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Holders of the Class
A ordinary shares and holders of the Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote
of our shareholders, except as required by law. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result
that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our shareholders
are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. 

We
will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial
business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of
two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations
described herein. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed
to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and placement shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. 

If
we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public shareholder,
together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate
of 15 of the shares of ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. However, we would
not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business
combination. Our shareholders inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our
initial business combination, and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares
on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we
complete the initial business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding
15 and, to dispose such shares would be required to sell their ordinary shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 

In
the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after an initial business combination, our shareholders are entitled
to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made
for each class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription
rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will provide our shareholders with the
opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
account, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described in the Report. 

Redeemable
Warrants 

Each
whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our Class A ordinary shares at a price of 11.50 per share, subject
to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of November 18, 2022, and 30 days after the completion of our initial
business combination. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares
of Class A ordinary shares. 

The
warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier
upon redemption or liquidation. 

We
will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary
shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations
described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable, and we will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A
ordinary shares upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A ordinary shares issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified
or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. If the conditions
in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled
to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle
any warrant. If a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant
will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A ordinary shares underlying such unit. 

We
have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of our initial business combination,
we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon
exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those
shares of Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration
statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60 th 
business day after the closing of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration
statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following
the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement
and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis
pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, provided that
such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants
on a cashless basis. 

Once
the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of 0.01 per warrant; 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption given after the warrants become exercisable (the 30-day redemption
 period to each warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for share
 splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period
 commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant
 holders. 

If
and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of ordinary shares
upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable
to effect such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares of ordinary shares under
the blue-sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us in our initial public offering. 

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise
its warrant to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a
 cashless basis, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding
and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise
of our warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering
their warrants for that number of shares of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the
number of shares of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants
and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose
shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day
prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option,
the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of Class A ordinary shares to be received
upon exercise of the warrants, including the fair market value in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner
will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature
is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination. If
we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, our sponsor and its permitted transferees
would still be entitled to exercise their placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that
other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless
basis, as described in more detail below. 

A
holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the
right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person s
affiliates), to the warrant agent s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9 or 9.8 (or such other amount as
a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. 

The
warrants have certain anti-dilution and adjustment rights upon certain events. 

The
warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental, as warrant agent, and us. You should review
a copy of the warrant agreement, which has been filed as an exhibit to the S-1 Registration Statement for a complete description of the
terms and conditions applicable to the warrants. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without
the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement
to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement, or defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders
of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered
holders of public warrants. 

In
addition, if (x) we issue additional shares of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than 9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares
(with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such
issuance to our sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor or such affiliates, as
applicable, prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity
proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our
initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the
warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and
the 18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the greater
of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 

The
warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant
agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full
payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number
of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A ordinary shares and any voting
rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Class A ordinary shares. After the issuance of shares of Class A ordinary
shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share held of record on all matters to be
voted on by shareholders. 

No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive
a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of Class A ordinary shares
to be issued to the warrant holder.
