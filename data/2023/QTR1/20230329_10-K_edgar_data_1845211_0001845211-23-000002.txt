Computershare 9062 Old Annapolis Road Columbia, Maryland 21045 www.computershare.com ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA Computershare Corporate Trust- ABS Platform The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: Purchase of corporate trust business. On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited, and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. For the ABS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, (collectively, the ABS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new ABS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related ABS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall ABS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of ABS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the ABS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Period: As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). Platform: The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the Period. Exhibit 33.3

Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 4.

Appendix B-1 Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

Computershare 9062 Old Annapolis Road Columbia, Maryland 21045 www.computershare.com ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA Computershare Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: Purchase of corporate trust business. On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited, and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. For the Document Custody Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Period: As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). Platform: The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 Exhibit 33.5 

2 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the Period. Applicable Servicing Criteria: Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM GRANT THORNTON LLP 1201 Walnut Street, Suite 2200 Kansas City, MO 64106 D +1 816 412 2400 F +1 816 412 2404 Exhibit 34.1 

As described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various vendors to perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(viii). The Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its related interpretations, the requirement for management to assess compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if the Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria. Compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s activities comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are operating effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our examination does not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company, in its Management Report, is eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. In our opinion, management s assertion that Bridgecrest Credit Company, LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the CARVANA-originated public auto loan receivables servicing platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.
