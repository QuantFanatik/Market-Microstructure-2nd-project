PART I Item 1. Business (a) General development of business Nestor Partners (the Partnership is a limited partnership organized December 13, 1976 under the New Jersey Uniform Limited Partnership Act. The general partner of the Partnership is Millburn Ridgefield Corporation, a Delaware corporation operating in New York, New York (the General Partner ). The Partnership s business is trading a diversified portfolio (a Diversified Portfolio of futures, forward, swap, spot and option contracts on currencies, metals, interest rate instruments, stock indices, energy and agricultural commodities. The General Partner invests globally pursuant to its proprietary quantitative and systematic trading methodology, based upon signals generated from an analysis of a range of quantitative data. Approximately 20 - 30 of the Partnership s trading, measured by the General Partner s assessment of risk, currently takes place in the currency markets. The Partnership began its trading activities in February 1977. All investment decisions are made by the General Partner. The General Partner was organized in May 1982 to manage discretionary accounts in futures and forward markets. It and its principals have been trading in the futures and forwards markets pursuant to systematic quantitative, trading and risk management methods since 1971. The General Partner has been registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC as a commodity pool operator CPO since July 1, 1982, as a commodity trading advisor CTA since September 13, 1984 and has been a member of the National Futures Association (the NFA since July 1, 1982. The General Partner has been an approved swaps firm with the NFA since December 26, 2012. The Millburn Corporation, a former affiliate of the General Partner that, prior to January 1, 2019, performed research, trading, technology, operations, marketing, accounting, tax, legal, compliance, human resources, and other administrative functions for the Partnership and other commodity pools and investment partnerships managed by the General Partner, merged with and into the General Partner on December 31, 2018, and the General Partner now performs the functions formerly performed by The Millburn Corporation. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate net asset value of the Partnership was 132,046,073. The value at December 31, 2022 of a limited partner s initial 1,000 investment in the Partnership on February 1, 1977 would be 65,235.62, based on the actual rate of return a limited partner s investment in the Partnership would have recognized, net of the highest charges applicable to a limited partner, during each month in the calculation period from February 1, 1977 to December 31, 2022. The Partnership s fiscal year ends on December 31. The Partnership will terminate upon the prior withdrawal, insolvency or dissolution of the General Partner or occurrence of any event legally requiring termination. The Partnership is not a registered investment company or mutual fund. Accordingly, investors in the Partnership do not have the protections afforded by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. (c) Description of business The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures, forward and spot contracts and may trade options thereon as well as swap contracts. The Partnership s sole trading advisor is the General Partner. The Partnership trades, pursuant to the General Partner s Diversified Portfolio, in the agricultural, metals, energy, interest rate and stock indices futures markets and in the currency markets, trading primarily forward contracts in the interbank market. The General Partner makes its systematically-based trading decisions pursuant to its investment and trading methodology, based on signals generated from an analysis a range of quantitative data, as well as certain money management principles, each of which may be revised from time to time. The objective of the General Partner s investment and trading methods is to consider these multiple data inputs, or factors, in order to arrive at relatively near-term forecasts for each traded instrument and take appropriate risk-managed positions. 

 1 

Trades generated by quantitative models may be profitable or unprofitable. Since the General Partner is well aware that many trades will ultimately lose money, its objective is to generate more frequent and/or larger profitable trades than losing trades. During periods in which market behavior differs significantly from that analyzed to build the models, or periods where data inputs important to predicting price movements were not included in those analyzed to build the models, substantial losses are possible, and even likely. The General Partner is engaged in an ongoing research effort to improve its investment and trading methods and to apply its quantitative analytic expertise to new financial products, markets and instruments. Successful systematic trading depends on several elements. Two of the main elements are the development and selection of the trading systems used in each market and the allocation of portfolio risk among the markets available for trading. Market environments change over time, and particular systems may perform well in one environment but poorly in another. Likewise, market sectors and individual markets go through periods where systematic trading is profitable and other periods where no system is able to generate any profits. The goal of the General Partner s research has been to develop and select a mix of systems in each market and to allocate risk across a wide array of markets, so as to contain overall portfolio risk within a targeted range, while allowing exposure to profitable opportunities. Over approximately 52 years, the General Partner and its predecessor entities have developed hundreds of trading systems. These trading systems generate buy or sell decisions in a particular market based on the analysis of a range of quantitative data, and the interactions of such data, in the particular market or in markets in general. Of course, systems can be materially different better in some periods and worse in others. Some of the main distinguishing characteristics include: the time frame over which systems work e.g. , intra-day to long-term); the granularity of data fed into them e.g. , tick data to daily, weekly or monthly frequencies); the amount of historical data used to learn the market structure; the statistical methods used to make forecasts; the type of data e.g. , price, price-derivative, fundamental and other quantitative data); and the source of data e.g. , cash, futures, forward, option or equity markets-generated data or government-, and industry- or company-generated statistical information). No single system will work all the time. Therefore, the General Partner s objective is to have several systems operating in conjunction with one another. When arriving at the portfolio allocation, the General Partner generally seeks maximum diversification, subject to liquidity and sector concentration constraints, the mandate of the strategy, and the General Partner s judgement and experience. Each instrument is traded using a diversified set of systems, which may be optimized for groups of markets, sectors or specific markets. The markets traded and allocations are reviewed at least monthly, although changes may occur more or less frequently. The following factors, among others, are considered in constructing a universe of markets to trade for the Partnership: profitability, market liquidity, professional judgment, desired diversification, transaction costs, and exchange and other regulations. The current allocation to any market in the Partnership s portfolio does not exceed 3.0 of total market exposure, measured by risk allocation. These allocation levels may be exceeded in the future at the discretion of the General Partner. Risk is a function of both price level and price volatility. For example, for any given level of volatility, a 100,000 barrel crude oil position is worth more and is, therefore, probably more risky with oil at 90 per barrel than with oil at 50 per barrel. Similarly, oil would be more risky if prices are moving in a 5 daily range than if prices are moving in a 1 daily range. The General Partner sizes the position in each market taking into account its measurement of risk based on price level and volatility in that market. Market exposure is then managed by the position-sizing models which measure the risk in the portfolio s position in each market. In the event the model determines that the risk has changed beyond an acceptable threshold, it will signal a change in the position a decrease in position size when risk increases and an increase in position size when risk decreases. The General Partner s position-sizing models seek to maintain overall portfolio risk and distribution of risk across markets within designated ranges. The position-sizing model manages the position traded in the aggregate through the combination of the (directional) trading systems discussed above. In addition, the General Partner s risk management processes focus on money management principles applicable to the portfolio as a whole and also to individual markets. The first principle is portfolio diversification, which attempts to improve the quality of profits by reducing volatility. 

 2 

Additional money management principles applicable to the portfolio as a whole include: (1) limiting the assets committed as margin or collateral, generally within a range of 5 to 35 of an account s net assets, though the amount may at any time be substantially higher or lower and (2) prohibiting pyramiding that is, using unrealized profits in a particular market as margin for additional positions solely in the same market. Another important risk management function is the careful control of leverage or total portfolio exposure. Leverage levels are determined by simulating the entire portfolio all markets, all systems, all risk control models, the exact weightings of the markets in the portfolio and the proposed level of leverage over multiple years to determine the portfolio s simulated risk and return characteristics as well as the simulated worst-case drawdown experienced by the portfolio in the simulation period. The simulated worst-case drawdown, or peak-to-trough drawdown, is measured from a daily high in portfolio assets to the subsequent daily low whether that occurs days, weeks or months after the daily high. If the General Partner considers this simulated drawdown too severe or the portfolio s simulated volatility too high, it can set the leverage or level of the actual portfolio accordingly so as to reduce the total portfolio exposure. There are, however, no restrictions on the amount of leverage the Partnership may use at any given time. Decisions whether to trade a particular market require the exercise of judgment. The decision not to trade certain markets for certain periods, or to reduce the size of a position in a particular market, may result at times in missing significant profit opportunities. The General Partner s discretion and expertise in the execution of trades plays a role in timing of orders and, from time to time, the General Partner may adjust the size of a position, long or short, in any given market indicated by its systematic trading strategies. This exercise of discretion (other than in trade execution) has historically been very rare and would generally occur only in response to unusual market conditions that may not have been factored into the design of the trading systems. Such adjustments would be done with the intention of reducing risk exposures as opposed to seeking additional risk. Decisions to make such adjustments also require the exercise of judgment and may include consideration of the volatility of the particular market; the pattern of price movements, both inter-day and intra-day; open interest; volume of trading; changes in spread relationships between various forward contracts; and overall portfolio balance and risk exposure. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the Limited Partnership Agreement ), the General Partner receives in respect of limited partners who acquire their limited partnership interests Interests through selling agents, a fixed monthly brokerage fee equal to 0.375 of the Partnership s month-end net assets (4.5 per annum) attributable to such limited partners capital accounts. To the extent set forth in a limited partner s subscription agreement, a limited partner introduced by certain selling agents may also be required to pay to such selling agent an upfront selling commission of up to 2 of the amount invested in the Partnership. Any such selling commission will be deducted by the selling agent directly from the amount intended to be invested in the Partnership and will therefore not be considered in calculating the profit share as described below. In respect of limited partners who acquire their Interests through the General Partner or an Advisory Program, an asset-based fee or fixed fee advisory program through which an investment adviser recommends a portfolio allocation to the Partnership, the General Partner receives brokerage commissions at a fixed monthly rate of 0.146 of the Partnership s month-end net assets (1.75 per annum) attributable to such limited partner s capital account plus an amount equal to the brokerage commissions and fees payable to clearing and executing brokers attributable to each such limited partners proportionate interest in the Partnership. The General Partner in turn bears all such brokerage commissions and fees payable to clearing and executing brokers as well as any compensation payable to selling agents in the form of installment selling commissions. The General Partner also receives a profit share equal to 20 of any new trading profit, determined as of the end of each calendar year. The annual profit share is calculated net of brokerage fees and administrative expenses. The Partnership pays its administrative expenses, including costs incurred in connection with the continuing offering of the Interests, up to of 1 per annum of the Partnership s average month-end assets, and any extraordinary expenses which it may incur. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Deutsche Bank ), BofA Securities Inc. BofA and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC GS Co currently act as the futures brokers for the Partnership. The Partnership also currently engages in currency forward trading with Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America, N.A., which serve as the Partnership s prime brokers for such transactions, but may utilize the services of additional prime brokers or engage in such trading with other banks and dealers as well. At the present time, the Partnership clears its currency forward trades with Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America, N.A. The Partnership pays bid ask spreads on its forward trades, as such spreads

are incorporated into the pricing of forward contracts. The General Partner monitors the Partnership s trades to ensure that the prices it receives are competitive. Each partner has a capital account, and its initial balance is the amount of his contribution to the Partnership. There is also a new profit memo account which is credited with the General Partner s profit share on redeemed Interests and any excess of the General Partner s profit share over the Partnership s taxable gains at year-end. The net assets of the Partnership are determined monthly, and any increase or decrease from the end of the preceding month is added to or subtracted from the accounts (including the new profit memo account) of the partners in the ratio that each account bears to all accounts. The credits to the new profit memo account are charged to the accounts of the limited partners. At the end of each fiscal year, the Partnership s taxable capital gain or loss (including gains and losses on open positions in certain futures and forward contracts which are marked-to-market at the end of the Partnership s fiscal year) and ordinary income and expense are allocated among the partners for tax purposes, and each partner who is a United States U.S. citizen or resident is required to include on his personal income tax return his distributive share of such items. Items of operating income such as interest and items of operating expense such as legal, accounting and filing fees that accrued during each month will be allocated among the persons who were partners during each month in the ratio that each partner s capital account bears to all partners capital accounts. Net capital gain is allocated first to the General Partner up to the amount of the General Partner s profit share for the year and then up to the amount of any balance in the new profit memo account. Net capital gain is next allocated to each partner who has redeemed all or a portion of his Interests during the year to the extent that the amount received on redemption exceeds the partner s tax basis tax basis ). A partner s tax basis is the amount paid for the Interests redeemed plus net taxable income less taxable losses previously allocated to such Interests and less amounts previously distributed to the partner with respect to the redeemed Interests. Remaining net capital gain is allocated among the partners whose capital accounts have increased from their tax basis. The allocation to each partner is in the ratio that his increase bears to all partners increases. Net capital gain remaining is allocated to each partner in the ratio that his capital account value bears to the total capital account value of all partners. Net capital loss is allocated first to each partner who has redeemed all or a portion of his Interests during the year to the extent that the amount the partner s tax basis for the Interests redeemed exceeds the amount received on redemption. Remaining net taxable capital loss is allocated among the partners whose capital accounts have decreased from their tax basis. The allocation to each partner is in the ratio that his decrease bears to all partners decreases. Net capital loss remaining is allocated to each partner in the ratio that his capital account value bears to the total capital account value of all partners. The General Partner estimates that 90 or more of the Partnership s assets, including the assets used to satisfy margin and collateral requirements, will be invested in U.S. government securities or securities issued by federal agencies (or, to a limited extent, foreign government securities in connection with trading on non-U.S. exchanges), other CFTC-authorized investments or held in bank or certain other money market instruments e.g. , bankers acceptances and Eurodollar or other time deposits). The balance of the Partnership s assets will be held in cash in commodity brokerage accounts, bank accounts or other accounts in the name of the Partnership and will be used for trading which requires cash for margin and to avoid daily buying and selling of government securities. The Partnership s assets deposited with the Partnership s futures brokers as margin are maintained in customer segregated funds accounts or foreign futures and foreign options secured amount accounts. The Partnership does not engage in lending (other than through permitted securities investments). Regulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the CEA ), commodity exchanges and futures trading are subject to regulation by the CFTC. NFA, a registered futures association under the CEA, is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for futures industry professionals. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of CTAs, CPOs, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, swap dealers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers and floor traders. The CEA requires CPOs and CTAs, such as the General Partner, and commodity brokers or futures commission merchants FCMs and swap dealers, such as Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank AG, BofA, Bank of America, N.A and GS Co to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements. The CFTC may suspend a CPO s or CTA s registration if it finds that its trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions or in certain other situations. In the event that the registration of the General Partner as a CPO or a CTA were terminated or suspended, the General 

 4 

Partner would be unable to continue to manage the business of the Partnership. Should the General Partner s registration be suspended, termination of the Partnership might result. In addition to such registration requirements, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short positions which any person may hold or control in certain futures contracts. Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day. The CFTC has also proposed, but not yet adopted, additional position limit rules covering energy, metals and agricultural derivative contracts. All accounts controlled by the General Partner are combined for speculative position limit purposes. The General Partner could be required to liquidate positions it holds on behalf of the Partnership, or may not be able to fully implement instructions generated by its trading models, in order to comply with such limits. Any such liquidation or limited implementation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership. It is as yet unclear whether the rules will have an adverse effect on the Partnership. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of over-the-counter OTC derivatives be executed in regulated markets and be submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses, subject to margin requirements. Associated dealer costs are generally passed through to market participants in the form of clearing account maintenance fees and less favorable dealer marks. The Partnership may also trade forward contracts in the inter-bank currency market. Such forward contracts are not currently traded on exchanges; rather, banks and dealers act as principals in these markets. As a result of the Reform Act, the CFTC regulates non-deliverable forwards (including many deliverable forwards where the parties do not take delivery), although currency forward contracts are generally not otherwise subject to regulation by any other U.S. government agency. Changes in the forward markets may entail increased costs and result in burdensome reporting requirements. There is currently no limitation on the daily price movements of forward contracts. Principals in the forward markets have no obligation to continue to make markets in the forward contracts traded. The imposition of credit controls by governmental authorities or the implementation of regulations pursuant to the Reform Act might limit such forward trading to less than that which the General Partner would otherwise recommend, to the possible detriment of the Partnership. (1)(i) through (v) - not applicable. (2)(i) - not applicable. (2)(ii) - the Partnership has no employees. Item 1A. Risk Factors Not required. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not required. Item 2. Properties The Partnership does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business. The General Partner performs administrative services for the Partnership from its offices. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The General Partner is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which either the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are subject. In addition there are no pending material legal proceedings involving the General Partner. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not required.

PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (a) Market Information There is no trading market for the Interests, and none is likely to develop. Interests may be redeemed upon 15 days written notice to the General Partner at their net asset value as of the last day of any month, subject to certain early redemption charges. (b) Holders As of December 31, 2022, there were 344 holders of Interests. (c) Dividends No distributions or dividends have been made on the Interests, and the General Partner has no present intention to make any. (d) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans None. (e) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities Interests are sold on a monthly basis through the General Partner and certain selling agents retained by the General Partner to act as its agents. The offering price of an Interest is equal to the amount of cash contributed to the Partnership by a limited partner. Between October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the Partnership did not issue any Interests. (f) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, limited partners may withdraw capital from their capital accounts in the Partnership as of the end of each calendar month. The withdrawal of capital by limited partners has no impact on the value of the capital accounts of other limited partners. The following table summarizes limited partner withdrawals during the fourth calendar quarter of 2022: Limited Partners Special Limited Partners Month Amount withdrawn Amount withdrawn October 31, 2022 542,328 1,405,986 November 30, 2022 367,543 411,405 December 31, 2022 635,142 0 Total 1,545,013 1,817,391 
 Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Interests may be offered for sale as of the beginning, and may be redeemed as of the end, of each month.

The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for monies to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and charges. Within broad ranges of capitalization, the General Partner s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership. The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any). The Partnership does not engage in borrowing. The Partnership trades futures contracts on interest rate instruments, agricultural commodities, currencies, metals, energy and stock indices, and forward contracts on currencies, and may trade spot and options on the foregoing and swaps thereon. Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of counterparties or brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk). Market risk is generally to be measured by the face amount of the futures positions acquired and the volatility of the markets traded. The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with these instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on these positions plus the value of the margin or collateral held by the counterparty. The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with OTC transactions because exchanges typically (but not universally) provide clearinghouse arrangements in which the collective credit (in some cases limited in amount, in some cases not) of the members of the exchange is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange. In OTC transactions, on the other hand, traders must rely (typically but not universally) solely on the credit of their respective individual counterparties. Margins which may be subject to loss in the event of a default are generally required in exchange trading and counterparties may require margin or collateral in the OTC markets. The General Partner has procedures in place to control market risk, although there can be no assurance that they will, in fact, succeed in doing so. These procedures primarily focus on (1) real time monitoring of open positions; (2) diversifying positions among various markets; (3) limiting the assets committed as margin or collateral, generally within a range of 5 to 35 of an account s net assets, though the amount may at any time be higher; and (4) prohibiting pyramiding that is, using unrealized profits in a particular market as margin for additional positions in the same market. The Partnership controls credit risk by dealing exclusively with large, well-capitalized financial institutions as brokers and counterparties. The financial instruments traded by the Partnership contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market values of the futures and forward contracts or the Partnership s satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition of the Partnership. Due to the nature of the Partnership s business, substantially all its assets are represented by cash, cash equivalents and U.S. government obligations, while the Partnership maintains its market exposure through open futures and forward currency contract positions. The Partnership s futures contracts are settled by offset and are cleared by the exchange clearinghouse function. Open futures positions are marked-to-market each trading day and the Partnership s trading accounts are debited or credited accordingly. Options on futures contracts are settled either by offset or by exercise. If an option on a future is exercised, the Partnership is assigned a position in the underlying future which is then settled by offset. The Partnership s spot and forward currency transactions conducted in the interbank market are settled by netting offsetting positions or payment obligations and by cash payments. The value of the Partnership s cash and financial instruments is not materially affected by inflation. Changes in interest rates, which are often associated with inflation, could cause the value of certain of the Partnership s debt securities to decline, but only to a limited extent. More important, changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down market price trends, during which the Partnership s profit potential generally increases. However, inflation can also give rise to markets which have numerous short price trends followed by rapid reversals, markets in which the Partnership is likely to suffer losses. The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, including U.S. government securities or securities issued by federal agencies (or, to a limited extent, foreign government securities in connection with trading on non-U.S. exchanges), other CFTC-authorized investments or held in bank or certain other money market instruments e.g. , bankers acceptances and Eurodollar or other time deposits), which are used to margin the Partnership s futures and forward currency positions and withdrawn, as necessary, to pay redemptions and expenses. Other than potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, due, for example, to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures and forward trading, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. During its operations through December 31, 

 7 

2022, the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the numerous markets traded by the General Partner. Results of Operations The Partnership s success depends on the General Partner s ability to recognize and capitalize on trends and other profit opportunities in different sectors of the global capital and commodity markets. The General Partner s investment and trading methods are confidential, so that substantially the only information that can be furnished regarding the Partnership s results of operations is its performance record. Unlike most operating businesses, general economic or seasonal conditions have no direct effect on the profit potential of the Partnership, while, at the same time, its past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Because of the speculative nature of its trading, operational or economic trends have little relevance to the Partnership s results. The General Partner believes, however, that there are certain market conditions for example, markets with strong price trends in which the Partnership has a better opportunity of being profitable than in others. 2022 During 2022, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of 23,381,810 from its trading operations (including foreign exchange transactions and translations). Brokerage fees of 2,702,218, administrative expenses of 320,051 and custody fees and other expenses of 22,947 were paid or accrued. The Partnership paid a profit share to the General Partner of 1,202,310. Interest income of 1,752,284 partially offset the Partnership s expenses resulting in a net income after profit share to the General Partner of 20,886,568. An analysis of the trading gain (loss) by sector is as follows: Sector Gain (Loss) Currencies 5.05 Energies 8.71 Grains (0.87) Interest rates 4.61 Livestock 0.05 Metals (0.78) Softs 0.07 Stock indices 3.67 Total 20.51 
 The Partnership was profitable for the period under review as gains from trading energy futures, interest rate futures, equity futures and currency forwards far outpaced losses from trading non-energy futures. From the start of the year through mid-June, market participants grew gloomy, equity and bonds prices plunged, the U.S. dollar soared and commodity prices neared record highs before beginning a descent. These market actions were likely impacted by: rising inflation and an increasingly hawkish monetary policy response from global central banks; recession fears; Russia s war on Ukraine; turbulent commodity markets; China s growth slowdown, property market slump and ZERO COVID lockdowns; and growing tensions between the U.S. and China. Thereafter, from mid-June through year-end, market participants alternated between periods of optimistic/risk-on and pessimistic/risk-off actions. Investors risk appetite seemingly improved as the market seemed to believe that improving inflation data may lead global central banks to follow a less hawkish policy path and China signaled increased support for its depressed real estate sector, an end to its ZERO COVID policy and a friendlier stance toward private sector businesses. On the other hand, some factors that impacted the first half of the year tight money, recession fears, the energy crisis, Russia s war on Ukraine, and U.S.-China tensions contributed to selling pressures affecting equity, fixed income, commodity and currency markets. Market volatility was impacted by the rollout of a U.K. fiscal policy proposal by short-lived Prime Minister Truss in September and by Xi Jinping s consolidation of power at the Communist Party Congress in early October.

During the first half of 2022, crude oil prices rose amid concerns of entering an oil-market squeeze triggered by too little investment and disciplined supply management from both Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers juxtaposed against oil consumption recovering toward pre-pandemic levels as economies started to reopen and as the Russia-Ukraine war generated fears that Russian energy supplies would be negatively impacted. Russia is among the top three global producers of crude oil and natural gas. In this environment, long positions in Brent crude, WTI crude, RBOB gasoline, London gas oil and heating oil were solidly profitable. Also, a long natural gas position was profitable during the second quarter. Although energy supplies remained limited during the second half of 2022, energy prices were volatile, and crude oil and crude product prices declined amid higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy, a stronger U.S. dollar, concern about possible European and U.S. recessions, China s persistent COVID-19 control and property sector efforts, and a significant release of oil from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve. During the July-December period, trading of energy futures was unprofitable as losses from Brent crude, WTI crude, London gas oil and natural gas outdistanced profits from RBOB gasoline and heating oil, thereby reducing somewhat the overall yearly gain from energy trading. Global central banks embrace of hawkish monetary policy stances in an effort to control high inflation; China s growth slowdown and property market distress; Europe s struggles with high energy prices; and the stagflationary impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war raised fears of a global recession, contributing to increased volatility and significant losses for global equities during 2022. Consequently, short positions in Chinese, Hong Kong, Korean, Singaporean, EAFE, Emerging market, U.K., German, Italian, and Brazilian equity index futures were profitable. On the other hand, trading of U.S., Dutch, French, EURO STOXX, Japanese, Taiwanese, Australian, Canadian and the VIX stock index futures posted partially offsetting losses. Led by central banks, including the Federal Reserve Fed ), European Central Bank ECB ), Bank of England and the Bank of Japan BOJ ), global interest rates increased throughout the year. Short positions in U.S., European, British and Canadian short-term interest rate futures were particularly profitable. Short positions in the German bund and U.S., British and Italian notes and bonds were also profitable, especially during the second half of the year. On the other hand, during the first half of 2022, long positions in German, Australian, Canadian and Japanese longer-term interest rate futures and trading of the U.S. 5-year note and French 10-year bond registered partially offsetting losses. The Bloomberg BBDXY dollar index gained about 15 over the first nine months of 2022 against the backdrop of a hawkish Fed, a relatively stronger U.S. growth outlook as compared to Europe and China, and continuing geopolitical unrest. During the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar declined about 8.5 through year-end as the Fed reduced the pace of its interest rate increases at its December meeting while the ECB and BOJ were relatively more hawkish than the Fed at their December meetings, perhaps impacted by the cumulative effect of past central bank FX market interventions against the U.S. dollar and Chinese efforts to speed up the reopening of their economy. Overall, long U.S. dollar positions versus the European Union euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Chilean peso were profitable. Short U.S. dollar trades versus the high yielding Mexican peso and Brazilian real were profitable as well. On the other hand, trading the U.S. dollar against the currencies of New Zealand, the U.K., Sweden, India and Israel produced partially offsetting losses. Finally, a short U.S. dollar/long Russian ruble trade was closed out at a loss during February when the Partnership halted trading of the Russian currency. Metals markets were turbulent during the year amid a variety of forces including post-pandemic economic reopening, Russia s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions, rising interest rates, recession fears and dollar volatility. Overall, trading of metal futures was unprofitable as losses from short gold and silver positions and from trading of aluminum and platinum outdistanced profits from a long nickel trade and a short copper trade. Grain prices were also highly volatile during 2022. A short wheat trade was unprofitable during February-May as the Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted prices. A short soybean meal position was unprofitable during the summer when prices rose after the USDA and the European Union s crop monitoring service reported worsening crop conditions due to damage from hot, dry weather. Trading of soybean oil, Kansas City wheat and soybeans was also unprofitable.

2021 During 2021, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of 11,171,262 from its trading operations (including foreign exchange transactions and translations). Brokerage fees of 2,791,006, administrative expenses of 302,794 and custody fees and other expenses of 20,703 were paid or accrued. The Partnership paid a profit share to the General Partner of 478. Interest income of 24,566 partially offset the Partnership s expenses resulting in a net income after profit share to the General Partner of 8,080,847. An analysis of the trading gain (loss) by sector is as follows: Sector Gain (Loss) Currencies (4.57) Energies 5.24 Grains (0.38) Interest rates 2.01 Livestock (0.04) Metals 0.13 Softs (0.64) Stock indices 8.03 Total 9.78 
 The Partnership was profitable for the period under review as gains from long equity and energy futures positions and trading of interest rate futures outdistanced the losses from trading currency forwards and non-energy commodity futures. The global reflation trade improved throughout most of the first half of 2021 in response to monetary and fiscal policy actions from global authorities especially in the U.S.; improvements in economic activity as economies cautiously reopened; and positive news concerning COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. However, during the second half of the year the global growth outlook was jolted periodically by the spread first of the COVID-19 Delta variant and later by the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant; by China s multi-pronged regulatory actions in support of its Common Prosperity, national security, financial stability and environmental goals; by supply chain difficulties, labor market shortages and soaring inflation that blunted consumer demand. The growth outlook was also impacted by a reduction of fiscal stimulus globally and by central banks beginning the process of scaling back ultra-accommodative policies. Geopolitical conflicts between the U.S. on the one hand and China, Russia and Iran on the other also worried market participants. Trading of equity futures was highly profitable during the January-June period when the reflation story was strongest. Equity markets were unaffected by the negative effects of the January Reddit and March Archegos events, as well as the week-long Suez Canal closure. During the summer, concerns about the durability of the global economic recovery and China s regulatory crackdown contributed to turbulence in global equity markets that were at near all-time highs. Later in the year, shifting central bank policies, Omicron variant worries, geopolitical tensions and global growth concerns periodically impacted the enthusiasm for equities. Still, massive liquidity, negative real yields, and strong actual and expected earnings growth contributed to the bull case for stocks. On balance, long positions in U.S., Canadian, European, British and EAFE stock index futures were profitable. Short positions in Brazilian and VIX futures, and trading of Chinese, Hong Kong and the MSCI emerging markets index futures were also profitable. Meanwhile, trading of Japanese and South African index futures were slightly unprofitable. Energy prices, despite a few sharp retrenchments amid growth worries, climbed during the January-November period. The price of Brent crude oil climbed from around 50/barrel at the start of the year to more than 86/barrel in late November amid a bullish picture that sparked speculation the price may return to 100 a barrel. There were demand increases for oil and natural gas as economies reopened, and as market participants viewed growth slowdowns as temporary. A surge in natural gas prices led to gas to oil switching in the power business, especially in Europe. On the supply side, prices drew some support from continued production discipline by both Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers. Consequently, inventories drained 

 10 

rapidly. However, the post-Thanksgiving emergence of the Omicron strain of COVID-19; Senator Manchin s unexpected NO on the Biden administration s Build Back Better legislation; and the Chinese growth slowdown contributed to the collapse of energy prices and Brent crude plunging below 70/barrel before closing the year near 78/barrel. On balance, long positions in Brent crude, WTI crude, RBOB gasoline, London gas oil and heating oil were profitable. On the other hand, a short U.S. natural gas position was unprofitable, particularly during the first eight months of the year. Interest rates were volatile during the period as evidenced by the U.S. 10-year government bond rate that spiked from around 0.90 at the start of the year to 1.75 at the end of March, fell back to about 1.10 at the start of August, and jumped again to near 1.70 in late October before closing the year around 1.50 . This path for interest rates reflected the ebb and flow of actual and anticipated moves in global growth and inflation which in turn was similar to the timing of COVID-19 pandemic spikes, global monetary, fiscal and regulatory policy shifts and the heightening of geopolitical tensions particularly involving the U.S., China, Russia and Iran. On balance, trading of U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Canadian, British, Japanese and Australian interest rate futures were profitable. Meanwhile, trading of European interest rate futures produced partially offsetting losses. Although the U.S. dollar did advance in 2021, especially late in the year, trading of individual currency pairs was volatile and trading of currency forwards was broadly unprofitable. Currency markets were impacted by fluid growth, inflation, and interest rate developments. Commodity price swings, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and political uncertainties involving various countries also contributed to exchange rate volatility. Trading the U.S. dollar against the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Brazilian, British, Swiss, and Swedish currencies, the euro and a few other currencies was unprofitable. Trading the euro against other European currencies was also unprofitable. On the other hand, a long U.S. dollar/short Japanese yen trade, a short U.S. dollar/long Russian ruble position and trading the dollar versus the Israeli and South African units registered somewhat offsetting gains. Finally, trading of non-energy commodities was fractionally negative. A short coffee position was unprofitable in April and May as prices increased in part because the 2020 drought reduced supplies from Brazil, Columbia and Nicaragua, and logistics and customs issues further constrained Brazilian exports. Trading of sugar was also slightly unprofitable. Wheat prices were volatile during the year and trading of wheat was unprofitable. On the other hand, long soybean and soybean oil trades were profitable during the first half of the year amid strong Chinese demand, weaker than expected U.S. harvests and dry weather in South America. Late in the year, a long soybean meal trade was profitable. Reflation and reopening demand positively impacted metal prices and long copper and aluminum trades were profitable early in the year. In addition, a short silver position was profitable near year end. Conversely, trading of gold, nickel and zinc produced partially offsetting losses. Critical Accounting Estimates The Partnership records its transactions in futures, forward and spot contracts, including related income and expenses, on a trade date basis. Open futures contracts traded on an exchange are valued at fair value, which is based on the closing settlement price on the exchange where the futures contract is traded by the Partnership on the day with respect to which net assets are being determined. Open spot contracts are recorded at fair value based on current market prices spot prices ). Open forward currency contracts are recorded at fair value, based on pricing models that consider the current market prices plus the time value of money forward points and contractual prices of the underlying financial instruments. The spot prices and forward points for open forward currency contracts are generally based on the 3:00 P.M. New York time prices provided by widely used quotation service providers on the day with respect to which net assets are being determined. The forward points from the quotation service providers are generally in periods of one month, two months, three months and six months forward while the contractual forward delivery dates for the foreign currency contracts traded by the Partnership may be in between these periods. The General Partner s policy is to calculate the forward points for each contract being valued by determining the number of days from the date the forward currency contract is being valued to its maturity date and then using straight-line interpolation to calculate the valuation of forward points for the applicable forward currency contract. The General Partner will also compare the calculated price to the forward currency prices provided by dealers to determine whether the calculated price is fair and reasonable. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as accrual of expenses, that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, the General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are appropriate and reasonable, however actual results could differ from these estimates. The estimates 

 11 

used do not provide a range of possible results that would require the exercise of subjective judgment. The General Partner further believes that, based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the Partnership s critical accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The report of (PCAOB ID: for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as required by this item, is included as Exhibit 13.01 to this report. Supplementary data is not required. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures The General Partner, with the participation of the General Partner s principal executive officers and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the Partnership as of the end of the fiscal year for which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is being filed, and, based on its evaluation, has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no significant changes in the General Partner s internal controls with respect to the Partnership or in other factors applicable to the Partnership that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The General Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Partnership s financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The General Partner s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Partnership s assets; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Partnership s financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that the Partnership s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the General Partner s management and directors; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on the Partnership s financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The General Partner assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting with respect to the Partnership as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework 

 12 

(2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the General Partner s internal control over financial reporting with respect to the Partnership is effective based on those criteria. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the General Partner to evaluate annually the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports. There were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information None. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections Not applicable.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Partners of Nestor Partners: Opinion on the Financial Statements and Financial Highlights We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Nestor Partners (the Partnership ), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital, and the financial highlights for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes. In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, the changes in its partners capital, and the financial highlights for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and financial highlights, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2022, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLP March 20, 2023 We have served as the auditor of one or more Millburn Ridgefield Corporation investment companies since 2004.

of Trading Profits, as defined, at the end of each year is charged to the limited partners capital accounts. New Trading Profits includes realized and unrealized trading profits (losses), interest income, brokerage fees, trading-related expenses and administrative expenses. For limited partners withdrawals during the year, the profit share calculation shall be computed as though the withdrawal date was at year-end. Profit share attributable to interests redeemed during a year is tentatively credited to an account maintained for bookkeeping purposes called New Profit Memo Account. Because limited partners may purchase their partnership interests at different times, they may recognize different amounts of Trading Profits. Each limited partner pays a profit share only on Trading Profits applicable to its partnership interest. Limited partners who make multiple investments in the Partnership receive separate partnership interests for purposes of tracking the profit share. Accordingly, in any given year some limited partners may experience net gains and be charged the profit share allocation for all or a portion of their interests where limited partners in the aggregate experienced net losses. Any profit share charged is added to the General Partner s capital account to the extent net taxable capital gains are allocated to the General Partner and the remainder, if any, of such profit share is added to the New Profit Memo Account. The General Partner may not make any withdrawal from the balance in the New Profit Memo Account. If, at the end of a subsequent year, net taxable gains are allocated to the General Partner in excess of such year s profit share, a corresponding amount is transferred from the New Profit Memo Account to the General Partner s capital account.

Notional values in the interest rate sector were calculated by converting the notional value in local currency of all open interest rate futures positions to -year equivalent fixed income instruments, translated to U.S. Dollars at each quarter end during 2022 and 2021. The -year note is often used as a benchmark for many types of fixed-income instruments and the General Partner believes it is a more meaningful representation of notional values of the Partnership s open interest rate positions.
