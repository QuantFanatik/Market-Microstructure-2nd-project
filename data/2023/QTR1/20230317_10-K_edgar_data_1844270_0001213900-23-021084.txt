PART I 

Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, with one or more businesses or assets, which we refer to as our initial business
combination. We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate
our initial business combination. 

We have concentrated our efforts
on identifying technology and financial services technology, or fintech, companies that power transformation and innovation. Our expertise
lends itself well to pursuing platforms related to the financial services, real estate, insurance, ecommerce and related technology infrastructure
sectors, but we are not required to complete our initial business combination with a business in these industries and, as a result, we
may pursue a business combination outside of these industries. We expect to pursue global businesses but may also acquire a domestic company.
We do not intend to acquire companies that have speculative business plans or are excessively leveraged. 

We believe our management team
has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire.
However, our management team s network and investing and operating experience do not guarantee a successful initial business combination.
The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are concurrently involved
with other businesses. There is no guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any
other role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until our initial business combination
is completed. Past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. 

1 

At December 31, 2022, we had
not yet commenced operations. All activity through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company s formation, its initial public offering,
and identifying a target company for our initial business combination. On December 6, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered
into a non-binding letter of intent with respect to a business combination. As a result, pursuant to the Company s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, the date by which the Company must cease operations and liquidate if it has not completed a business combination
has been automatically extended to August 23, 2023. 

The registration statement
for our initial public offering was declared effective on November 18, 2021. On November 23, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering
of 40,250,000 units generating gross proceeds of 402,500,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 1,778,750 placement units at a price of 10.00 per unit in a private placement
to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 17,787,500. 

Following the closing of the
initial public offering on November 23, 2021, an amount of 408,537,500 10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units
in the initial public offering and the placement units was placed in a trust account and invested in U.S. government securities, within
the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ),
with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act,
which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination,
(ii) the redemption of any public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination during
the completion window; or (iii) the distribution of the trust account, if we are unable to complete a business combination within the
completion window or upon any earlier liquidation of us. 

Business Strategy 

We have sought to capitalize
on the significant technology, financial services, financial technology and banking experience and contacts of Daniel G. Cohen, our Chairman
of the Board, and Ryan Gilbert, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our board of directors, to identify, evaluate and acquire
a technology or fintech business, although we may pursue a business combination outside of those industries. If we elect to pursue an
investment outside of those industries, our management s expertise related to those industries may not be directly applicable to
its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus regarding that industry might not be relevant to an understanding
of the business that we elect to acquire. 

Our Chairman served as an
executive officer and/or director of FinTech Acquisition Corp., or FinTech I, a former blank check company which raised 100.0 million
in its initial public offering in February 2015 and completed its initial business combination when it acquired FTS Holding Corporation
in July 2016, which we refer to as the FinTech I Acquisition. Our Chairman also served as an executive officer and/or director of FinTech
Acquisition Corp. II, or FinTech II, a blank check company which raised 175.0 million in its initial public offering in January 2017
and completed its initial business combination when it acquired Intermex Holdings II in July 2018, which we refer to as the FinTech II
Acquisition. In addition, our Chairman served as Chief Executive Officer of FinTech Acquisition Corp. III, or FinTech III, a blank check
company which raised 345.0 million in its initial public offering in November 2018 and completed its initial business combination
with Paya, Inc. in October 2020, which we refer to as the FinTech III Acquisition. Further, our Chairman served as Chief Executive
Officer of FinTech Acquisition Corp. IV, or FinTech IV, a blank check company which raised 230.0 million in its initial
public offering in September 2020 and completed its initial business combination with PWP Holdings LP, in June 2021, which we

 150.7 million in its initial public offering in March 2019 and completed its initial business combination when it merged with affiliates
of Shift Technologies, Inc. in October 2020, which we refer to as the INSU I Acquisition. Our Chairman and Chief Financial Officer also
served as Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of INSU Acquisition Corp. II , or INSU II, a blank check company which raised

Metromile, Inc. in February 2021, which we refer to as the INSU II Acquisition. 

2 

We believe that potential sellers
of target businesses will view the fact that members of our board and management team have successfully closed multiple business combinations
with vehicles similar to our company as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us.
However, past performance is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate.

NASDAQ rules require that we
must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If the initial business combination
involves more than one target business, the 80 fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions
and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder
approval, as applicable. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination.
If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain
an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect
to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent
determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced
with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets
or prospects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on NASDAQ for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to
meet the foregoing 80 fair market value test. 

We anticipate structuring our
initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares
will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company
owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management
team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target
sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business
combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the
outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result
of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own
less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests
or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business
or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ s 80 fair market value test. 

In addition to any potential
business candidates we identify on our own, other target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources,
including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or
divisions. 

In evaluating a prospective
target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent
management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial
and other information about the target and its industry. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, nor are we prohibited
from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with our sponsor, or an affiliate of our sponsor, in
the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner
with our sponsor, or any of its affiliates in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of independent directors,
will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect
to fair market value that the business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. 

As more fully discussed in
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions; and Director Independence Conflicts of Interest, if any of
our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to
which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination
opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Certain of our directors currently have relevant
fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. However, our sponsor, officers and directors
may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial
business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present
business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. We do not believe that
any potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

General 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination
using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these
as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. 

If we pay for our initial business
combination using stock or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase
price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash
released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

There is no current basis for
stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business
combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot
assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those
risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact
a target business. 

NASDAQ rules require that our
initial business combination be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the
balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing
a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. However, if our securities are not listed on NASDAQ or another
securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to that requirement. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial
business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance
with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our initial business
combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents
or proxy materials disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law
or NASDAQ, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

5 

Sources of Acquisition Candidates 

Target business candidates
are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, venture capital
funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds, brokers and other members of the financial community and
corporate executives. These target candidates may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Such sources became aware that we were seeking
a business combination candidate by a variety of means, including publicly available information relating to the initial public offering,
public relations and marketing efforts or direct contact by management following the completion of the initial public offering. 

Our officers and directors,
as well as their affiliates, also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their contacts.
We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may
pay a finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms
of the transaction. We will engage a finder only if our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that
may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management
determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which
case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our officers
or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior
to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is), other than (i) repayment of loans made to us prior to the date of the initial public offering by our sponsor
to cover offering-relating and organization expenses, (ii) repayment of loans that our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their respective affiliates may make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination (provided
that if we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment), (iii) payments to our sponsor or its affiliate
of a total of 40,000 per month for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services, (iv) at the closing of our initial
business combination, at the option of our management team, a customary advisory fee, if any, to affiliates of our sponsor, in an amount
that constitutes a market standard advisory fee for comparable transactions and services provided (the fees of which are not currently
estimable and have no established limits); (v) payment of customary fees for financial advisory services (including to CCM); and (vi)
to reimburse our sponsor, officers or directors for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an
initial business combination. Any advisory fee payable to an affiliate of our sponsor will be negotiated on an arms-length basis and will
require approval of our audit committee. None of the initial holders, our officers, our directors or any entity with which they are affiliated
will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective acquisition target in connection
with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting
agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will
not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates.
Additionally, we are not prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with such persons
in the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner
with such persons in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion
from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business
combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. Generally, such opinion is rendered to a company s board
of directors and investment banking firms may take the view that stockholders may not rely on the opinion. Such view will not impact our
decision on which investment banking firm to hire. 

Unless we consummate our initial
business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain a financial fairness opinion from an independent investment
banking firm. If we do not obtain such an opinion, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will
determine fair market value and fairness based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. The application of such standards
would involve a comparison, from a valuation standpoint, of our business combination target to comparable public companies, as applicable,
and a comparison of our contemplated transaction with such business combination target to other then-recently announced comparable private
and public company transactions, as applicable. The application of such standards and the basis of our board of directors determination
will be discussed and disclosed in our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business
of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business
combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently
have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

6 

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business
combination 

NASDAQ rules require that we
must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80 of fair
market value test. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one
or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading
multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses.
Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the
standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors
will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy
solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders
with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80 of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board
of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion
from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the
satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination
of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the
business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects.
We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject
to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective
target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or
a similar company with nominal operations. 

In any case, we will only complete
an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of
such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes
of NASDAQ s 80 fair market value test. There is currently no basis for stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of
any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. 

To the extent we effect our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth
we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

In evaluating a prospective
business target, we conduct a thorough due diligence review, which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management
and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and
other information made available to us. 

The time required to select
and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process,
are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of
a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses
and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack of business diversification 

For an indefinite period of
time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By consummating
a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

7 

Limited ability to evaluate the target s management team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business when evaluating a target business, our assessment of the target business management
may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage
a public company. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any
certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business
combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover,
we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular
target business. 

We cannot assure you that any
of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether
any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following a business combination,
we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we
will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience
necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Stockholders may not have the ability to approve
a business combination 

We may not seek stockholder
approval before we effect our initial business combination as not all business combinations require stockholder approval under applicable
state law. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or NASDAQ, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval
for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a table of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and
whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction 
 Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 No 
 
 Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of the company with a target 
 Yes 

So long as we obtain and maintain
a listing for our securities on NASDAQ, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 

any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

8 

Permitted purchases of our securities 

If we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender
offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their respective affiliates may purchase public securities in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination, although as of the date of
this Annual Report they have no commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we
anticipate that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities that have voted against the business combination
or sought redemption of their shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct negotiations for the purchase
of such holders positions. All holders approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no limit
on the number of shares they may acquire. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases
when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation
M under the Exchange Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. Although they do
not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may pay. They may
also enter into transactions to provide such holders with incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an initial business
combination. No funds in the trust account may be used to effect purchases of public securities in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. 

The purpose of such purchases
of public securities would be to (i) increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to
satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at
the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases
of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the
warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. This may result in the consummation of a business combination
that may not otherwise have been possible. 

As a consequence of any such
purchases by our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates, the public float of our common stock may be reduced and
the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to obtain the continued listing of our
securities on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange in connection with our initial business combination. 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or their respective affiliates anticipate that they will identify the public stockholders with whom they may pursue privately negotiated
purchases through either direct contact by the public stockholders or by our receipt of redemption requests or votes against the business
combination submitted by such public stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination.
The sellers of any shares so purchased by our sponsor, officers, advisors, directors and/or their affiliates would, as part of the sale
arrangement, revoke their election to redeem such shares and withdraw their vote against the business combination. The terms of such purchases
would operate to facilitate our ability to consummate a proposed business combination by potentially reducing the number of shares redeemed
for cash. 

Any purchases by our sponsor,
officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to
the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under
Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order
for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the
Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 

Redemption rights for public stockholders upon consummation of our
initial business combination 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of our initial
business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two
business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including any amounts representing deferred underwriting
commissions and interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is approximately 10.26 per public share (based on the trust
account balance as of December 31, 2022). The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not
be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have
entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder
shares, placement shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. However,
our sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares held by them if we fail to
consummate a business combination or liquidate within the completion window. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
either in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or by means of a tender offer. The decision
as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely
in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction
would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. 

We currently intend to conduct
redemptions pursuant to a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement
and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. 

9 

If a stockholder vote is not
required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of the proposed business combination, and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination that will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon the public announcement
of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate
any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply
with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

In the event we conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender
offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public
shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our Class A common
stock to become a penny stock (as such term is defined in Rule 3a5-1 of the Exchange Act, or any greater net tangible asset
or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender
more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination. 

If, however, stockholder approval
of the transaction is required by law or NASDAQ, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

We expect that a final proxy
statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy
statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct
redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive
and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NASDAQ listing
or Exchange Act registration. 

If we seek stockholder approval,
we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor
of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of
outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed
to vote any founder shares, placement shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. We expect
that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees
will own at least 28.2 of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements
may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public
shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our Class A common stock to
become a penny stock upon consummation of our initial business combination, and, in any event, the terms of the proposed
business combination may require a greater amount of net tangible assets. For example, the proposed business combination may require:
(i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working
capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of
the proposed business combination. If the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock
that are validly tendered plus the amount of any cash payments required pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds
the aggregate amount of cash available to us, taking into consideration the requirement that we maintain net tangible assets sufficient
so that our Class A common stock is not considered a penny stock or such greater amount depending on the terms of our potential
business combination, we will not consummate the business combination and any shares of Class A common stock tendered pursuant to the
tender offer will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer.

Limitation on redemption upon consummation
of a business combination if we seek stockholder approval 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to an aggregate of more
than 20.0 of the shares sold in the initial public offering without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will
discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise
their redemption rights as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the
then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of
20.0 of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination
if such holder s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or
on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem to no more than 20.0 of the shares sold in the initial
public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small number of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to
complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability
to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 20.0 of the shares sold in the initial
public offering) for or against our initial business combination. Our initial holders, sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant
to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares, placement shares or public shares held by them
redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted
transfer from an initial stockholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver.
However, to the extent any such affiliate acquired public shares in the initial public offering or thereafter through open market purchases,
it would be a public stockholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to an aggregate of more than 20.0 of the
shares sold in the initial public offering. 

Tendering stock certificates in connection
with redemption rights 

We may require our public stockholders
seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either
tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up
to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve our initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials,
or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At
Custodian) System, at the holder s option, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer
or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination
will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that
any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.
Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer
period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable,
to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable
for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer
agent will typically charge the tendering broker and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming
holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender
their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery
must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different
from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a
holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was
seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder
to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window 
after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company s stock in the market.
If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the
company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder
meeting, would become option rights surviving past the consummation of the initial business combination until the redeeming
holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s
election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder
meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivers its certificate in connection
with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such
holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds
to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of
an initial business combination. 

If the initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If our proposed initial business
combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate a business combination with a different target until the expiration
of the completion window. 

11 

Redemption of public shares and liquidation
if no initial business combination 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that we have only the completion window to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate
our initial business combination within the completion window, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
pro rata to our public stockholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs.
If we have not consummated a business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose
of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing
interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) and up to 100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then
outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the
right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following
such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in
each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There
will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the completion window. 

The initial holders, our officers
and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares, as applicable, (i)
in connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption
of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we have not completed
our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders 
rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination within the completion window
or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the completion window. However, the initial holders and our officers and directors will
be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares held by them if we fail to consummate a business combination within
the completion window. 

The underwriter has agreed
to waive its rights to deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account if we do not consummate a business combination and
subsequently liquidate and, in such event, the deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account will be available to fund the
redemption of our public shares. 

Our initial stockholders, executive
officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares
if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window unless we provide our public stockholders with the
opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash,
equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net
of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount
that would cause our Class A common stock to become a penny stock (as such term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange
Act). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy
this requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 

We will pay the costs of any
liquidation from the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement held out of trust, and up to 100,000 of
the interest income on the trust account (net of any taxes payable), and the balance of loans from our sponsor or one of its affiliates
for working capital purposes and to pay expenses to identify an acquisition target and consummate an initial business combination, although
we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purposes. 

If we were to expend all of
the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and
without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon
our dissolution would be approximately 10.15. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims
of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share
redemption amount received by stockholders will not be less than the 10.15 per public share initially on deposit in the trust account.
Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision
for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make
any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we
will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

12 

Although we will seek to have
all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other
entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or
even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited
to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability
of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the
trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management
will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed
a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.
If we do not obtain a waiver from a third party, we will obtain the written consent of our sponsor before our entering into an agreement
with such third party. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement
of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other
consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute
a waiver and where our sponsor executes a written consent. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any
claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek
recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, pursuant to a written agreement,
FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC, has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered
or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive transaction agreement,
reduce the amounts in the trust account to below 10.15 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of rights
to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the initial public offering
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot
assure you, however, that FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC will be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not independently verified whether
FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, we have not asked FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to reserve
for such obligations and we believe that its only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that FTAC Zeus
Sponsor, LLC will be able to satisfy those obligations. We believe the likelihood of FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC having to indemnify the trust
account is limited because we will endeavor to have all third parties that provide products or services to us and prospective target businesses
execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. 

If the proceeds in the trust
account are reduced below 10.15 per public share and FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent
directors would take legal action on our behalf against FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is
possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in a particular instance. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.15 per
public share. 

We will have access to the
net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement held out of trust with which to pay any such potential claims
(including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined
that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for
claims made by creditors. 

Under the DGCL, stockholders
may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution.
The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares if we do not
consummate our initial business combination within the completion window may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law.
If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision
for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation,
a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating
distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser
of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder
would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

13 

Furthermore, if the pro rata
portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not consummate
our initial business combination within the completion window is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such
redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors
could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.
If we have not consummated a business combination within the completion window, or earlier at the discretion of our board, we will: (i)
cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us to pay
our franchise and income taxes and up to 100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further
liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our
obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our
intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the expiration of the completion window and, therefore,
we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of
distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such
date. 

Because we will not be complying
with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for
our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However,
because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective
target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or
prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to
have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other
entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
held in the trust account. 

As a result of this obligation
and FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC s indemnification of the trust account against certain claims as previously described in this section,
we believe that the claims that could be made against us will be significantly limited and that the likelihood that any claim that would
result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC may be liable only to the extent necessary
to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below 10.15 per public share, and will not be liable as to any claims
under our indemnity of the underwriter of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC will not be responsible
to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 

If we file a bankruptcy petition
or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject
to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.15 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary
duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by
paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. 

We cannot assure you that claims
will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our public stockholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate a
business combination within the completion window. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination,
a stockholder s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its
shares for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described
above. 

14 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we encounter intense competition from other entities having a business
objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other
resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent
limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our
public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights will reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination.
In addition, the number of our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by
certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business
combination. 

Facilities 

We currently maintain our executive
offices at 2929 Arch Street, Suite 1703, Philadelphia, PA 19104-2870. The cost for our use of this space is included in the 40,000 per
month fee we pay to our sponsor or its affiliate for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services. We consider our
current office space adequate for our current operations. 

Employees 

We currently have two executive
officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs but they devote as much of their time
as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any
time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business
combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

We have registered our units,
Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual,
quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial
statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains
reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. 

We will provide stockholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials
sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared
in accordance with GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct
an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements
in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure
you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared
in accordance with the above requirements or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance
with the above requirements. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate
and report on our internal control procedures over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not
be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal
controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any
such acquisition. 

We are an emerging growth
company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage
of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth
companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some stockholders find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be
a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

15 

In addition, Section 107 of
the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial
public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700 million
as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities
during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with
it in the JOBS Act. 

Additionally, we are a smaller
reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced
disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller
reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals
or exceeds 250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal
year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30th. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

You should consider carefully
all of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face and of which we are currently aware, and all of
the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the events or developments described below occur, our business, financial
condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. 

Risks Relating to our Search for, Consummation
of, or Inability to Consummate, 
a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks 

Our public stockholders may not be afforded
an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination, unless such vote is required by law or NASDAQ, which means we may consummate
our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination. 

We may not hold a stockholder
vote to approve our initial business combination unless the business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable state
law or the rules of NASDAQ or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons. For example, NASDAQ rules currently
allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we
were seeking to issue more than 20 of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore,
if we structure a business combination that requires us to issue more than 20 of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval
of such business combination. However, except as required by law, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed
business combination will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the
transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate
our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock do not approve of the business
combination we consummate. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial
business combination, our sponsor, directors and officers have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless
of how our public stockholders vote. 

Our sponsor, officers and directors
have agreed to vote their founder shares and any placement shares and public shares they hold in favor of our initial business combination.
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be
received than would be the case if holders of founder shares agreed to vote their founder shares, placement shares and public shares in
accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders. 

Your ability to affect the investment decision
regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless
we seek stockholder approval of the business combination. 

At the time of your investment
in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Since our board
of directors may consummate a business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right to
vote on the business combination unless we seek such stockholder vote. Accordingly, your ability to affect the investment decision regarding
a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights with respect to a proposed business combination. 

16 

The ability of our public stockholders to
redeem their shares for cash may make us unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to
enter into a business combination with a target. 

We may enter into a transaction
agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to provide all of our stockholders with an opportunity to redeem all
of their shares in connection with the consummation of any initial business combination, although our sponsor, directors and officers
and each holder of placement units has agreed to waive his, her or its respective redemption rights with respect to founder shares and
placement shares, and in the case of the initial holders, public shares held by him, her or it in connection with the consummation of
our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets
to be less than the amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, or cause our Class A common stock to become a
 penny stock as such term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act, we would not proceed with such redemption and the
related business combination. Prospective targets would be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination
transaction with us. 

The ability of our public stockholders to
exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to consummate the most desirable business combination
or optimize our capital structure. 

At the time we enter into an
agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore
will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If
our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or
requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such
requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption than we initially
expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third
party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher
than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B common
stock result in the issuance of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common stock at
the time of our business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination
available to us or optimize our capital structure. 

The ability of our public stockholders to
exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination
would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock. 

If our initial business combination
agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount
of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful increases. If our initial business combination
is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in
need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount
to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose
the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market. 

The requirement that we complete a business
combination within the completion window may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and
may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which
could undermine our ability to consummate a business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. 

Any potential target business
with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must consummate a business combination within
the completion window. Consequently, such target businesses may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing
that if we do not complete a business combination with it, we may be unable to identify another target business and complete a business
combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the end of the completion window. Depending upon when
we identify a potential target business, we may have only a limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into a business combination
on terms that we might have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. 

17 

We may not be able to consummate a business
combination within the completion window, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would
redeem our public shares and liquidate. 

We must complete our initial
business combination within the completion window. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate a business combination
within that time period. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions,
volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. If we have not consummated a business combination within
the completion window, or earlier, at the discretion of our board pursuant to the expiration of a tender offer conducted in connection
with a failed business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash,
equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account,
less any interest released to us for the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further
liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our
obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such case, our public
stockholders may only receive 10.15 per share and our warrants will expire worthless. 

Our search for a business combination, and
any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus
(COVID-19) outbreak and the status of debt and equity markets. 

The COVID-19 outbreak
has resulted, and a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases could result, in a widespread health crisis that could adversely
affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business
combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued
concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target
company s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain
and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain
COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue
for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we
ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction
may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events, including
as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable
to us or at all. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial
business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares of common stock from public stockholders,
in which case they may influence a vote in favor of a proposed business combination that you do not support and reduce the public float 
of our Class A common stock or public warrants. 

If we seek stockholder approval
of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer
rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their respective affiliates may purchase shares or warrants in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers
and their respective affiliates may also enter into transactions with stockholders and others to provide them with incentives to, among
other things, acquire shares of our common stock or vote their shares in favor of an initial business combination. Our directors, officers
or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed
to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act or in a transaction which would violate Section
9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although
still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public
stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their
prior elections to redeem their shares. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A common
stock or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain
or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

If a stockholder fails to receive notice
of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for
tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 

We will comply with the tender
offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our
compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may
not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the tender offer documents or proxy materials, as applicable, that
we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures
that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. For example, we may require our public stockholders seeking
to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender
their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer materials mailed to such holders, or up to two
business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials,
or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures,
its shares may not be redeemed. Please see Business Tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights. 

18 

You will not have any rights to or interest
in funds from the trust account, except under limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell
your shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. 

Our public stockholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business combination;
(ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within the completion window, subject to
applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we
do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window; or (iv) otherwise upon our liquidation or in the event
our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to
the expiration of the completion window (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such date if it
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining time that we will be able to identify an attractive business
combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In addition, if our
plan to redeem our public shares if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within the completion window is not consummated
for any reason, Delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to
the distribution of the proceeds held in our trust account. In that case, public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond the end of
the completion window before they receive funds from our trust account. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any rights to the proceeds from our trust account with
respect to their warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially
at a loss. 

You will not be entitled to protections
normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. 

Since we intend to use the
net proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement to complete an initial business combination with a target business
that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However,
because we had net tangible assets in excess of 5.0 million upon the completion of the initial public offering and the private placement
and we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated
by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419 under the Securities Act. Accordingly, investors will not be
afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units were immediately tradable and we have a
longer period of time to complete a business combination than would companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, offerings subject to Rule
419 would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us, except in connection with our consummation
of an initial business combination. 

Because of our limited resources and the
significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete a business combination. If
we are unable to complete our initial business combination, you may receive only 10.15 per share from our redemption of your shares,
and our warrants will expire worthless. 

We encounter intense competition
from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships),
other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire.
Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly,
acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical,
human and other resources, or more industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire, our ability
to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources.
This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore,
because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of Class A common stock which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our
initial business combination, target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If
we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only 10.15 per share from our redemption
of our shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. 

If the net proceeds from the initial public
offering and the sale of the placement units not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available
to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from
our sponsor or management team to fund our search for an initial business combination, to pay our taxes and to complete our initial business
combination. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. 

Of the net proceeds of the
initial public offering and the private placement, 557,193 was available to us as of December 31, 2022 outside the trust account to fund
our working capital requirements. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management
team or other third parties to operate, or we may be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, members of our management team nor any
of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from
funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to 2,000,000
of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender at the time of the business combination.
The units would be identical to the placement units. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business
combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we
will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive 10.15 per
share on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders
may receive less than 10.15 per share on the redemption of their shares. Please see If third parties bring claims
against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be
less than 10.15 per share and other risk factors in this section. 

19 

Subsequent to consummation of our initial
business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have
a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some
or all of your investment. 

Even if we conduct extensive
due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this examination will uncover all material risks that
may be presented by a particular target business, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later
arise. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies the principal risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may
materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. As a result, from time to time following our initial business
combination, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that
could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity,
the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition,
charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing
debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any securityholders who choose
to remain securityholders following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such securityholders
are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the
breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring
a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the initial business
combination constituted an actionable material misstatement or omission. 

If third parties bring claims against us,
the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than
 10.15 per share. 

Placing funds in the trust
account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (except
our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public
stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements or, even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing
claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, claims for fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility
or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement
waiving claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and
will only enter into an agreement without a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly
more beneficial to us than any available alternative. If we do not obtain a waiver from a third party, we will obtain the written consent
of our sponsor before entering into an agreement with such third party. 

Examples of possible instances
where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular
expertise or skills management believes to be significantly superior to those of other consultants who would execute a waiver or in cases
where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver and where our sponsor executes a written consent. In
addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising
out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption
of our public shares, if we are unable to complete a business combination within the required time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption
right in connection with a business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived
that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public
stockholders could be less than the 10.15 per share initially held in the trust account due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to
a written agreement, FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for
services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we discussed entering into a transaction agreement,
reduce the amounts in the trust account to below 10.15 per share except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of rights
to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the initial public offering
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, if an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have
not independently verified whether FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, we have not asked
FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we believe that its only assets are securities of our company.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that it would be able to satisfy these obligations. 

20 

Our directors may decide not to enforce
the indemnification obligations of FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available
for distribution to our public stockholders. 

If proceeds in the trust account
are reduced below 10.15 per public share and FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has
no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against
FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take
legal action on our behalf against FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance.
If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available
for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below 10.15 per share. 

We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy
indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers. 

We have agreed to indemnify
our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any
reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside
of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may
discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions
also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action,
if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected
to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 

If, after we distribute the proceeds in
the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us
that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as
having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive
damages. 

If, after we distribute the
proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed
against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy
laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek
to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, by making distributions to public stockholders before making provision
for creditors, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad
faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims for punitive damages. 

If, before distributing the proceeds in
the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us
that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share
amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 

If, before distributing the
proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed
against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included
in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any
bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with
our liquidation may be reduced. 

21 

Our stockholders may be held liable for
claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. 

Under the DGCL, stockholders
may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution.
The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not consummate our initial business combination within the completion window may be considered a liquidation distribution under
Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes
reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against
the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period
before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution
is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any
liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our
public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the completion window if we do not consummate an initial business combination
and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. 

Because we will not be complying
with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for
our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our
dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching
for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers or investment
bankers) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders
with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount
distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could
potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders
may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public
stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate our initial business combination within the completion window
is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant
to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution,
instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. 

We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders
until after we consummate a business combination. 

We may not hold an annual meeting
of stockholders until after we consummate a business combination (unless required by NASDAQ), and thus may not be in compliance with Section
211(b) of the DGCL, which requires that an annual meeting of stockholders be held for the purposes of electing directors in accordance
with a company s bylaws unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders
want us to hold an annual meeting prior to our consummation of a business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting
an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL. Even if an annual meeting was held for
the purpose of electing directors prior to the consummation of a business combination, only holders of Class B common stock would be entitled
to notice of such meeting and to vote at such meeting. 

You will be unable to ascertain the merits
or risks of any particular target business operations. 

We will seek to consummate
a business combination with an operating company in the financial technology industry, but may also pursue acquisition opportunities in
other business sectors or geographic regions, except that we are not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, permitted
to effectuate a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. As a result, you have
no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business s operations, results of operations, cash flows,
liquidity, financial condition or prospects. If we consummate our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent
in the business operations of the entity with which we combine. Because we will seek to acquire businesses that potentially need financial,
operational, strategic or managerial redirection, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially
or operationally unstable entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target
business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate
time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control
or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. Accordingly, any securityholders who choose to remain
securityholders following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. We also cannot assure
you that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity
were available, in an acquisition target. 

22 

We may seek investment opportunities in
sectors outside of our industry focus (which may or may not be outside of our management s area of expertise). 

Although we currently intend
to consummate a business combination in the financial technology industry, we will consider a business combination outside this industry
if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive investment opportunity
for our company. If we elect to pursue an investment outside of the financial technology industry, our management s expertise in
that industry would not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained herein regarding the financial
technology industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. 

Although we have identified general criteria
and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into a business combination with
a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines and, as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business
combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. 

Although we have identified
specific criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter
into a business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we consummate a business combination with a target that
does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet
all of our general criteria and guidelines. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be
less favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in an initial business combination candidate.
In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a
greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition
with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval
of the transaction is required by law or NASDAQ, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be
more difficult for us to obtain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general
criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive 10.15
per share on our redemption, and our warrants will expire worthless. 

We may seek acquisition opportunities with
an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings, which could
subject us to volatile revenues or earnings, intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. 

To the extent we complete our
initial business combination with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of
sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks
include investing in a business without a proven business model and with limited historical financial data, volatile revenues or earnings,
intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate
the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors
and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave
us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. 

We are not required to obtain an opinion
from an independent investment banking firm and, consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we
are paying for the target in our initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. 

Unless we consummate our initial
business combination with an affiliated entity or our board cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business,
we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders
from a financial point of view. If we do not obtain an opinion, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors,
who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed
in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. 

If we hold a stockholder vote and must furnish
our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business
combination with some prospective target businesses. 

If we hold a stockholder vote
to approve our initial business combination, the federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business
combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure. If we make
a tender offer for our public shares, we will include the same financial statement disclosure in our tender offer documents whether or
not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements
may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time
for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination within the completion
window. 

23 

The requirement that we maintain a minimum
net worth or retain a certain amount of cash could increase the probability that we will be unable to complete a proposed business combination
and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock. 

If, pursuant to the terms of
our proposed business combination, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth or retain a certain amount of cash in trust in order
to consummate the business combination, the ability of our public stockholders to cause us to redeem their shares in connection with such
proposed transaction will increase the risk that we will not meet that condition and, accordingly, that we will not be able to complete
the proposed transaction. If we do not complete a proposed business combination, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust
account until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market. If you were to attempt to sell your stock in the open
market at that time, the price you receive could represent a discount to the pro rata amount in our trust account. In either situation,
you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate. 

Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and
increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires
that we maintain a system of internal controls and that we evaluate and report on such system of internal controls. In addition,
once we are no longer an emerging growth company, we must have our system of internal controls audited. The fact
that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared
to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete a business combination may not be in compliance with
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any
such entity in order to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such
acquisition. 

We do not have a specified maximum redemption
threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold will make it easier for us to consummate a business combination with which a substantial
number of our stockholders do not agree. 

We may be able to consummate
a business combination even though a substantial number of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed
their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with
our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, if our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates have entered into
privately negotiated agreements with public stockholders to acquire public shares. However, in no event will we redeem our public shares
in an amount that would cause our Class A common stock to become a penny stock as such term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 of
the Exchange Act, and the amount that we redeem may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related initial business combination, and instead
may search for an alternate business combination. 

Unlike many blank check companies, our balance
sheet reflects negative stockholders equity. 

The financial statements in
this annual report, after collaboration with our independent registered public accounting firm, reflect that all of the public shares
are subject to redemption, even though we are prohibited under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation from redeeming all
of the public shares since such redemption would result in our Class A common stock becoming a penny stock as such term
is defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. As a result, all of the public shares are classified as temporary equity, presented outside
of the stockholders deficit section of our balance sheet. This accounting presentation may not be consistent with that of other
blank check companies and may make comparison of our financial statements to that of other blank check companies more difficult. 

In order to effectuate an initial business
combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments,
including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
our governing instruments or our warrant agreement in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination
that our stockholders may not support. 

In order to effectuate an initial
business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing
instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination,
increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants,
amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will require the approval of holders of 65 of our common stock, and amending our warrant agreement will
require a vote of holders of at least 65 of the public warrants. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires
us to provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares
if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other provision relating
to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent any such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally
change the nature of our outstanding securities, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities.
We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business
combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination. 

24 

We may have a limited ability to assess
the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose
management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. 

When evaluating the desirability
of effecting a business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business management may
be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target s management, therefore,
may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we expected. Should the target s
management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability
of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. 

The provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing
the release of funds from our trust account), including an amendment to permit us to withdraw funds from the trust account such that the
per share amount investors will receive upon any redemption or liquidation is substantially reduced or eliminated, may be amended with
the approval of holders of 65 of our common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies.
It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to facilitate
the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that any of its provisions related to pre-initial business combination activity (including the requirement to
deposit proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement into the trust account and not release such amounts except in
specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein and including to permit us to withdraw
funds from the trust account such that the per share amount investors will receive upon any redemption or liquidation is substantially
reduced or eliminated) may be amended if approved by holders of 65 of our common stock entitled to vote thereon, and corresponding provisions
of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65 of our common
stock entitled to vote thereon. In all other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders
of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock
exchange rules. We may not issue additional securities that can vote with common stockholders on matters related to our pre-initial business
combination activity, on any amendment to certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or on our initial
business combination. Our initial stockholders, who collectively beneficially own 28.2 of our common stock, will participate in any vote
to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner
they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which govern
our pre-initial business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to
complete an initial business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

Our sponsor, officers and directors
have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within the completion window, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares
of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then
on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are
contained in a letter agreement that we have entered into with our sponsor, officers and directors. Our stockholders are not parties to,
or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor,
officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our stockholders would need to pursue
a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. 

We may be unable to obtain additional financing
to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure
or abandon a particular business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may
only receive 10.15 per share on our redemption. 

Because of the size of our
initial business combination, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption
in connection with our initial business combination, or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our
initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We may
be unable to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment has made it especially difficult
for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate
our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure or abandon the transaction and seek an alternative target
business candidate. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive 10.15 per
share on our redemption. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to consummate our initial business combination, we may
require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have
a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders
is required to provide any financing to us after a business combination. 

25 

Our initial stockholders will control the
election of our board of directors until consummation of our initial business combination and will hold a substantial interest in us.
As a result, they will elect all of our directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination and may exert a substantial
influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. 

Our initial stockholders own
approximately 28.2 of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the founder shares, all of which are held by our initial stockholders,
entitle the holders to elect all of our directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. Holders of our public
shares have no right to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation may only be amended by a majority of at least 90 of our common stock voting at a stockholder meeting. As a result, you
will not have any influence over the election of directors prior to our initial business combination. 

Neither our initial stockholders
nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities. Factors that would
be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A common stock.
In addition, as a result of their substantial ownership in our company, our initial stockholders may exert a substantial influence on
other actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and approval of major corporate transactions. If our initial stockholders purchase any additional shares
of common stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their influence over these actions. Accordingly,
our initial stockholders will exert significant influence over actions requiring a stockholder vote. 

Our sponsor controls a substantial interest
in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. 

Our sponsor owns 28.2 of our
issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder
vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Holders of founder shares are not restricted from purchasing Class A common stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions,
which would increase their control. The holders of founder shares do not have any current intention to purchase additional securities.
Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our common
stock. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by the initial holders, is divided into two classes with only one
class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of
stockholders) serving a two-year term. At each annual meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board of directors, only
a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our sponsor, because of its ownership position, will have considerable
influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, you should anticipate that our sponsor will continue to exert control at least until the
consummation of our initial business combination. 

Resources could be wasted in researching
acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate another target business and
consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may
only receive 10.15 per share from our redemption of our shares and our warrants will expire worthless. 

The investigation of each specific
target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments will
require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete
a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable.
Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate our initial business combination
for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred,
which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business due to a reduction in
the funds available for expenses relating to such efforts. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders
may only receive 10.15 per share from our redemption of their shares and our warrants will expire worthless. 

26 

Our key personnel may negotiate employment
or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with our initial business combination. These agreements may provide for
them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and, as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest
in determining whether a particular business combination would be advantageous to us. 

Our key personnel may decide
to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or
consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation
of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities
for services they would render to us after the consummation of our initial business combination. The personal and financial interests
of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business and cause them to have conflicts of
interest in determining whether a particular business combination would be advantageous to us. However, we believe the ability of such
individuals to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision
as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel
will remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will
remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us
will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

We may attempt to consummate business combinations
with multiple prospective targets simultaneously, which may hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination and give
rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. 

If we determine to acquire
several businesses simultaneously that are owned by different sellers, we will need each seller to agree that our purchase of its business
is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our
ability, to complete the initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including
additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers)
and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies
in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, we may be unable to operate the combined business
successfully, and you could lose some or all of your investment in us. 

We may attempt to consummate our initial
business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with
a company that is not as profitable as we expected, or at all. 

In pursuing our acquisition
strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information exists
about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on
the basis of the information developed during our due diligence examination, which may be limited. As a result, we could acquire a company
that is not as profitable as we expected, or at all. Furthermore, the relative lack of information about a private company may hinder
our ability to properly assess the value of such a company which could result in our overpaying for that company. 

If we effect our initial business
combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may adversely
affect us. 

If we pursue a target company
with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens
in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business
combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. 

If we pursue a target a company
with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks
associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial
business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators
or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 

If we effect our initial business
combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an
international setting, including any of the following: 

costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations; 

rules and regulations regarding currency redemption; 

complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals; 

laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected; 

27 

exchange listing and/or delisting requirements; 

tariffs and trade barriers; 

regulations related to customs and import/export matters; 

local or regional economic policies and market conditions; 

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 

challenges in managing and staffing international operations; 

longer payment cycles; 

tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; 

currency fluctuations and exchange controls; 

rates of inflation; 

challenges in collecting accounts receivable; 

cultural and language differences; 

employment regulations; 

underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems; 

corruption; 

protection of intellectual property; 

social unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances; 

regime changes and political upheaval; 

terrorist attacks and wars; and 

deterioration of political relations with the United States. 

We may not be able to adequately
address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we
complete such initial business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

We may not be able to maintain control of
a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business,
new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 

We anticipate structuring our
initial business combination to acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. However, we may structure
our initial business combination to acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business, but only if we (or
any entity that is a successor to us in a business combination) acquire a majority of the outstanding voting securities or assets of the
target. Even if we own a majority interest in the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business
combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common
stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 interest in the target.
However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such
transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other
minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company s
stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that we will not be able to maintain our control of the target
business. 

28 

We may issue notes or other debt securities,
or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our financial condition and the value
of our stockholders investment in us. 

We may choose to incur substantial
debt in order to complete our initial business combination. The incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness, even if we make all principal and interest payments when due, if we breach covenants that require the maintenance of financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand and the lender demands payment; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if any debt we incur contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while the debt is outstanding; 

prohibitions of, or limitations on, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock; 

use of a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, as well as for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of growth strategies and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

We do not have a policy with
respect to how much debt we may incur. To the extent that the amount of our debt increases, the impact of the effects listed above may
also increase. 

We may complete a business combination with
only one business, which would result in our success being dependent solely on a single business which may have a limited number of products
or services. This lack of diversification may harm our operations and profitability. 

We are not limited as to the
number of businesses we may acquire in our initial business combination. However, we may not be able to effectuate a business combination
with more than one target business because of various factors, including the limited amount of the net proceeds of the initial public
offering, the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with
the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined
basis. By consummating an initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous
economic, competitive and regulatory risks particular to the industry area in which the acquired business operates. Further, we would
not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities
which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry.
Accordingly, the prospects for our success may: 

solely depend upon the performance of a single business, property or asset, or 

depend upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

This lack of diversification
may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon
the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination. 

The officers and directors of an acquisition
candidate may resign upon consummation of a business combination. The loss of an acquisition target s key personnel could negatively
impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

The role of an acquisition
candidate s key personnel upon the consummation of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although
we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate s management team will remain associated with us following our initial
business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. The
loss of an acquisition target s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

29 

We may partner, submit a joint bid or enter
into a similar transaction with holders of founder shares or an affiliate in connection with our pursuit of, or in connection with, a
business combination. 

We are not prohibited from
partnering, submitting a joint bid or entering into any similar transaction with holders of founder shares or their affiliates in our
pursuit of a business combination. Although we currently have no plans to do so, we could pursue such a transaction if we determined that
such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and the transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested
directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm regarding
the fairness to our stockholders from a financial point of view of a business combination with any holder of founder shares or its affiliates,
the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.
Additionally, were we successful in consummating such a transaction, conflicts could invariably arise from the interest of the holder
of founder shares or its affiliate in maximizing its returns, which may be at odds with the strategy of the post-business combination
company or not in the best interests of the public stockholders of the post-business combination company. Any or all of such conflicts
could materially reduce the value of your investment, whether before or after our initial business combination. 

A failure to comply with privacy regulations
could adversely affect relations with customers and have a negative impact on business. 

Depending upon the type of
business we acquire, in the course of providing services to our customers we may collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential
information on our customers and their clients. A failure of our systems due to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses,
misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other causes could result in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized
disclosure of confidential customer information. Any such failure could result in damage to our reputation with our customers, expose
us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, and impair our ability to operate profitably. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual
property and we may be subject to infringement claims. 

We expect to rely on a combination
of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect any proprietary technology of a
target business. Although we intend to protect vigorously any intellectual property we acquire, third parties may infringe or misappropriate
our intellectual property or may develop competitive technology. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate
our products or services or design around our intellectual property rights. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual
property rights, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which is expensive, could cause a
diversion of resources and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce
intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. 

We also may be subject to
claims by third parties for infringement of another party s proprietary rights, or for breach of copyright, trademark or license
usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. An adverse determination
in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party s intellectual property, obtain a license for that
technology or license alternative technology from another party. None of these alternatives may be available to us at a price which would
allow us to operate profitably. In addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of
the time and attention of management and employees. Any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use
the intellectual property subject to these claims. 

Risks Relating to our Sponsor and Management
Team 

We are dependent upon our officers and directors;
the loss of any one or more of them could adversely affect our ability to complete a business combination. 

Our operations depend upon
the background, experience and contacts of our officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of
our officers and directors, at least until we have consummated a business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with, or
key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or officers. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required
to, and do not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our
operations and the search for a business combination and their other business commitments. We do not intend to have any full-time employees
prior to the consummation of our business combination. Each of our executive officers and directors is engaged in other business endeavors
and is not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. If our executive officers and directors 
other business commitments require them to devote substantial amounts of time in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit
their ability to devote time to our affairs which make it more difficult for us to identify an acquisition target and consummate our business
combination. 

30 

Our success following our initial business
combination likely will depend upon the efforts of management of the target business. The loss of any of the key personnel of the target s
management team could make it more difficult to operate the target profitably. 

Although some of our key personnel
may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following a business combination, we can offer no assurance
that any will do so. Moreover, as a result of the existing commitments of our key personnel, it is likely that we will retain some or
all of the management of the target business to conduct its operations. The departure of any key members of the target s management
team could thus make it more difficult to operate the post-combination business profitably. Moreover, to the extent that we will rely
upon the target s management team to operate the post-combination business, we will be subject to risks regarding their managerial
competence. While we intend to closely scrutinize the skills, abilities and qualifications of any individuals we retain after a business
combination, our ability to do so may be limited due to a lack of time resources or information. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that
our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct and that they will have the skills, abilities and qualifications we expect. 

Certain of our officers and directors are
now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be
conducted by us, including another blank check company, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and
determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 

Following the completion of
the initial public offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we will engage in the business of identifying and
combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities
(such as operating companies or investment vehicles) that are engaged in a similar business. . In addition, our sponsor, officers and
directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion
of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether
to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. 

Our officers and directors
also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe
certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular
business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented
to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a waiver of the corporate
opportunity doctrine, which provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless
(i) such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, (ii) such
opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and (iii) the
director or officer is permitted to refer the opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. The purpose for the surrender
of corporate opportunities is to allow officers, directors or other representatives with multiple business affiliations to continue to
serve as an officer of our company or on our board of directors. Our officers and directors may from time to time be presented with opportunities
that could benefit both another business affiliation and us. In the absence of the corporate opportunity waiver in our charter,
certain candidates would not be able to serve as an officer or director. We believe we substantially benefit from having representatives,
who bring significant, relevant and valuable experience to our management, and, as a result, the inclusion of the corporate opportunity 
waiver in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides us with greater flexibility to attract and retain the officers
and directors that we feel are the best candidates. 

However, the personal and
financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business
and completing a business combination. The different timelines of competing business combinations could cause our directors and officers
to prioritize a different business combination over finding a suitable acquisition target for our business combination. Consequently,
our directors and officers discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of
interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders 
best interest, which could negatively impact the timing for a business combination. 

For a discussion of our officers 
and directors business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, please see the sections
of this Annual Report entitled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Conflicts
of Interest. 

We may engage in a business combination
with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers, directors
or existing stockholders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest. 

We may decide to acquire one
or more businesses affiliated with holders of founder shares, or our officers and directors. Our officers and directors also serve as
officers and board members of other entities. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. The holders of
founder shares and our officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to consummate a business combination
with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning a business combination with
any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities,
we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that the targeted affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and
the transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our stockholders from a financial point of view of
a business combination with one or more businesses affiliated with our executive officers, directors or holders of founder shares, potential
conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public
stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. Although we have no formal policy in place for vetting potential conflicts
of interest, our board of directors will review any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. 

31 

Since holders of founder shares and placement
units will lose some or all of their investment in us if we do not consummate a business combination, a conflict of interest may arise
in determining whether a particular acquisition target is appropriate for our initial business combination. 

Our initial holders currently
own 14,009,583 founder shares, which will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial business combination. Our sponsor also purchased
an aggregate of 1,778,750 placement units for an aggregate purchase price of 17,787,500. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to the founder shares, placement shares or placement warrants, which will expire worthless
if we do not consummate a business combination within the completion window. If we do not consummate a business combination, our sponsor
will realize a loss on the placement units it purchased. As a result, the personal and financial interests of certain of our officers
and directors, directly or as members of our sponsor, in consummating an initial business combination, along with their flexibility in
identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate, may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business
combination and completing an initial business combination that is not in the best interests of our stockholders. Consequently, the discretion
of our officers and directors, in identifying and selecting a suitable target business combination may result in a conflict of interest
when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular initial business combination are appropriate and in the best
interest of our public stockholders. 

Risks Relating to our Securities 

If we are deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted,
which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. 

If we are deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including: 

restrictions on the nature of our investments; and 

restrictions on the issuance of securities; 

each of which may make it difficult
for us to complete our initial business combination. 

In addition, we may have imposed
upon us burdensome requirements, including: 

registration as an investment company with the SEC; 

adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and 

reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and compliance with other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to. 

32 

In order not to be regulated
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged
primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding or trading investment securities constituting more than 40 of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government
securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business is to identify and complete an initial business combination and thereafter
to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale
or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. 

We do not believe that our
anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may
only be invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company
Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted
to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business
plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant
bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act. Our securities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment
securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our primary
business objective, which is a business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares
if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window; and (iii) absent a business combination, our return
of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest
the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the
Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted
funds and may hinder our ability to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination,
our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.15 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will
expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than 10.15 per share on the redemption of their
shares. Please see If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and
the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than 10.15 per share and other risk factors in this section. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a stockholder, or a group of
stockholders, who are deemed to hold an aggregate of more than 20.0 of our common stock may not redeem any shares they hold that exceed
such 20.0 amount. 

If we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender
offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of
such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section
13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to shares in excess of 20.0 of the shares sold
in the initial public offering without our prior written consent. We refer to such shares in excess of 20.0 or more of the shares sold
in the initial public offering as Excess Shares . However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to
vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem any Excess
Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to consummate a business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment
in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect
to the Excess Shares if we consummate our business combination. As a result, you would continue to hold that number of shares exceeding
20.0 and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell them in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 

NASDAQ may delist our securities from trading
which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

We cannot assure you that
our securities will continue to be listed on NASDAQ in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing
our securities on NASDAQ prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels.
Generally, we must maintain an average global market capitalization and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 400 public
holders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with NASDAQ s
initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than NASDAQ s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain
the listing of our securities on NASDAQ. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least 4.00 per share and
we would be required to have a minimum of 400 round lot holders (with at least 50 of such round lot holders holding securities with a
market value of at least 2,500) of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements
at that time. 

33 

If NASDAQ delists our securities
from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities
could be quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the pink sheets. If this were to occur, there could be material
adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

a determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of, or no, news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

The National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which
are referred to as covered securities. Because our units, Class A common stock and warrants are listed on NASDAQ, our units,
Class A common stock and warrants are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities,
the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud and, if there is a finding of fraudulent
activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state,
other than the state of Idaho, having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies,
certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers,
to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities
would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

Purchases of Class A common stock in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions by our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may make it difficult for
us to continue to list our common stock on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange. 

If our sponsor, directors,
officers or their affiliates purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, it
would reduce the public float of our Class A common stock and the number of beneficial holders of our common stock, which
may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our common stock on a national securities exchange if we determine to apply
for such listing in connection with the business combination. If the number of our public holders falls below 400 or if the total number
of shares held by non-affiliates is less than 750,000, we will be non-compliant with NASDAQ s continued listing rules and our common
stock could be de-listed. If our common stock were de-listed, we could face the material consequences set forth in the immediately preceding
risk factor. 

We may issue additional common or preferred
shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after consummation of our initial business combination,
which would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 90,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and 20,000,000
shares of Class B common stock, par value 0.0001 per share and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per
share. There are currently 26,956,875 and 5,990,417 authorized but unissued shares of Class A and Class B common stock, respectively,
available for issuance, which amount takes into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants but not upon
the conversion of the Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common
stock at the time of our initial business combination, initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment. There are no shares
of preferred stock currently issued and outstanding. 

34 

We may issue a substantial
number of additional shares of common stock, and may issue shares of preferred stock, in order to complete our initial business combination
or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination (although our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that we may not issue additional securities that can vote with common stockholders on matters related to our
pre-initial business combination activity, on any amendment to certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
or on our initial business combination or that would entitle holders thereof to receive funds from the trust account). We may also issue
shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of the Class B common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial
business combination as a result of the applicable anti-dilution provisions. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that
would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote on any initial business combination. 

The issuance of additional
shares of common or preferred stock: 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the initial public offering; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock; 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, common stock and/or warrants. 

35 

If you exercise your public warrants on
a cashless basis, you will receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise
such warrants for cash. 

There are circumstances in
which the exercise of the public warrants may be required or permitted to be made on a cashless basis. First, if a registration statement
covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the
closing of our initial business combination, warrantholders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise
warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Second, if our Class A common
stock is at any time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of
a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants
who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we
so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event we do not so elect, we will
use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Third,
if we call the public warrants for redemption, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants
to do so on a cashless basis. In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering
the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number
of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and
the fair market value (as defined in the next sentence) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value 
is the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the
date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants,
as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such
warrants for cash. 

The grant of registration rights to our
initial stockholders and purchasers of placement units may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the
future exercise of such rights may reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. 

Pursuant to an agreement entered
into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in the initial public offering, our initial stockholders and their permitted
transferees and purchasers of placement units can demand that we register the founder shares, placement shares, placement warrants and
the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the placement warrants. This would include the 14,009,583 founder shares,
1,778,750 placement shares and 889,375 placement warrants. These registration rights will be exercisable at any time commencing upon the
date that such shares are released from transfer restrictions. We will also grant registration rights to our sponsor or one of its affiliates
in connection with the issuance of warrants included in the units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans. We will
bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading
in the public market may reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may
make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude because the stockholders of the target business may increase
the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price
of our Class A common stock that is expected when the securities owned by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees are
registered. 

We may amend the terms of the warrants in
a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants. 

Our warrants were issued in
registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant
agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any
defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change
that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants
in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although
our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited,
examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants
into cash or stock, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise
of a warrant. 

We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior
to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. 

We have the ability to redeem
outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at 0.01 per warrant, provided that the
last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our Class A common stock in the event the shares of our Class A common stock are
not traded on any specific trading day) of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, reorganizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day
prior to the date we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire
period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering
the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and
when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying
securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the
holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you: (i) to exercise your warrants
and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current
market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the
outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. 

36 

Our warrants and founder shares may have
an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination. 

In the initial public offering,
we issued warrants to purchase 20,125,000 shares of our Class A common stock as part of the public units. In addition, on the closing
date of the initial public offering, we sold 1,778,750 placement units to our sponsor, with each unit consisting of one placement share
and one-half of one placement warrant, each whole warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock. Prior to the initial
public offering, we issued an aggregate of 14,009,583 founder shares in a private placement. The founder shares are convertible into shares
of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In addition, if our sponsor or one of its affiliates makes any
working capital loans, such loans may be converted into units, at the price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. Such units
would be identical to the placement units. 

To the extent we issue shares
of Class A common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares
of Class A common stock upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a
target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and reduce the
value of the shares of Class A common stock issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our warrants and founder shares may
make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. 

The placement warrants are
identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in the initial public offering except that, so long as they are held by the initial
purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) they may not (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants),
subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination,
and (ii) they will be entitled to registration rights. 

Because each unit contains one-half of one
warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies. 

Each unit contains one-half
of one warrant. Because, pursuant to the warrant agreement, the warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares, only a whole
warrant may be exercised at any given time. This is different from other blank check companies similar to ours whose units include one
share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We established the components of the units in this way in order to
reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate
for one-half of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe,
a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth
less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share. 

A provision of our warrant agreement may
make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. 

Unlike many blank check companies,
if (x) we issue additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than 9.20 per share (with such
issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by us and in the case of any such issuance to our sponsor or its affiliates,
without taking into account any founder shares held by our initial stockholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance)
(the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the
total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the completion
of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume-weighted average trading price of our shares of
Class A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we complete our initial
business combination (such price, the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be
adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 18.00 per share
redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued
Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future
for our common stock and could entrench management. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their
best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms
of and issue new series of preferred shares. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or
prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions
that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. 

Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors,
officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery
in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service
of process on such stockholder s counsel, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other
employees or stockholders. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors,
officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery
in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service
of process on such stockholder s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines
that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent
to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have
notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

This choice of forum provision
may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our
directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court
were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable
in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business,
operating results and financial condition. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject
to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty
or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not
apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have
exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We note, however, that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision
and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

General Risk Factors 

We are an early stage company with no operating
history and no revenue and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 

We are an early stage company
with no operating history and no revenue. We will not commence operations until we consummate our initial business combination. Because
we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of acquiring one
or more operating businesses in the financial technology industry. We may be unable to complete a business combination. If we fail to
complete a business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. 

38 

Changes in laws or regulations or how such
laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business,
including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations. 

We are subject to laws and
regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. We are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements.
Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations
and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our
business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted
and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business
combination and results of operations. 

On March 30, 2022, the SEC
issued proposed rules relating to, among other items, disclosures in business combination transactions involving SPACs (defined below)
and private operating companies; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of
projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; the potential liability of certain participants
in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which special purpose acquisition companies SPACs could
become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment
as an investment company if they satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC s duration, asset composition, business purpose and
activities. These rules, if adopted, whether in the form proposed or in a revised form, may increase the costs of and the time needed
to negotiate and complete an initial business combination, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial
business combination. 

Our management has concluded that there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have until August 23, 2023
to consummate a business combination. It is uncertain whether we will be able to consummate a business combination by this time. If a
business combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of us. We had working
capital of 487,895, net of income taxes payable and franchise taxes payable, as of December 31, 2022; however, we will incur additional
expenses as it relates to the consummation of a business combination. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory
liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report do not contain any adjustments that
might result should we be required to liquidate after August 23, 2023. 

We may be subject to the 1 excise tax instituted
under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in connection with redemptions we conduct after December 31, 2022. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S.
federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries
of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation
itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value
of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. For purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted
to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable
year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been
given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. 

Any redemption or other repurchase
we conduct after December 31, 2022, in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise
tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise
would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the business
combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE 
or other equity issuances in connection with a business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a business combination
but issued within the same taxable year of a business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury.
In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the
excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a business combination
or otherwise inhibit our ability to complete a business combination. 

39 

Past performance by our management team
may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company. 

Past performance by our management
team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able
to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team s
performance as indicative of our future performance of an investment in the company or the returns the company will, or is likely to,
generate going forward. 

We are an emerging growth company and a
smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements
available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and
may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. 

We are an emerging
growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but
not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from
the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments
not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be
an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market
value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case
we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities
less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance
on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading
market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

Further, Section 102(b)(1)
of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until
private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class
of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS
Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging
growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which
means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison
of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which
has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards
used. 

Additionally, we are a smaller
reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain
reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain
a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals
or exceeds 250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded 100 million during such
completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700 million as
of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial
statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. 

The requirements of being a public company
may strain our resources and divert management s attention. 

As a public company, we are
subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (which we refer to as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act),
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (which we refer to as the Dodd-Frank Act), the listing requirements of NASDAQ
and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial
compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly
after we are no longer an emerging growth company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve
our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and
management oversight may be required. As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could
adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to
comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses. 

In addition, changing laws,
regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing
legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject
to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve
over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance
matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply
with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion
of management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new
laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their
application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. 

40 

However, for as long as we
remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation
and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions
until we are no longer an emerging growth company. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial
public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700 million
as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three
year period. 

We may face risks related to financial technology businesses. 

Business combinations with
financial technology businesses may involve special considerations and risks. If we complete our initial business combination with a financial
technology business, we will be subject to the following risks, any of which could be detrimental to us and the business we acquire: 

If the company or business we acquire provides products or services which relate to the facilitation of financial transactions, such as funds or securities settlement system, and such product or service fails or is compromised, we may be subject to claims from both the firms to whom we provide our products and services and the clients they serve; 

If we are unable to keep pace with evolving technology and changes in the financial services industry, our revenues and future prospects may decline; 

Our ability to provide financial technology products and services to customers may be reduced or eliminated by regulatory changes; 

Any business or company we acquire could be vulnerable to cyberattack or theft of individual identities or personal data; 

Difficulties with any products or services we provide could damage our reputation and business; 

A failure to comply with privacy regulations could adversely affect relations with customers and have a negative impact on business; and 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and we may be subject to infringement claims. 

Any of the foregoing could
have a negative adverse impact on our operations following a business combination. However, our efforts in identifying prospective target
businesses will not be limited to the financial technology industry. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry,
these risks will likely not affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or
target business which we acquire, none of which can be presently ascertained.

The payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial
condition subsequent to completion of an initial business combination, and will be at the discretion of our board of directors at such
time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the
foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with a business combination, our ability to declare dividends
may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

to the sponsor pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Each placement unit consists
of one share of Class A common stock and one half of a placement warrant. The placement warrants are identical to the warrants included
in the units issued in the initial public offering, except that, if held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (a)
they (including the underlying Class A common stock) may not be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the consummation of

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated in Delaware on December 11, 2020 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. We intend to effectuate our business
combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units that occurred simultaneously
with the completion of our initial public offering, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

We expect to continue to incur
significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will
be successful. 

43 

Results of Operations 

All activity for the period from December 11, 2020 (inception) through
December 31, 2020 was de minimis and related only to our formation. All activity for the period from January 1, 2021 (commencement of
operations) through December 31, 2022 relates to our formation, the Initial Public Offering and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying
a target company for an initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of
our Business Combination, at the earliest. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities
held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of 1,378,408,
which consisted of interest income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 5,888,798, offset by operating costs of 3,319,946
and provision for income taxes of 1,190,444. 

For the period from January
1, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 803,856, which consisted of formation and operating
costs of 807,727, offset by interest income on investments held in Trust Account of 3,871. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On November 23, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of
40,250,000 Units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the
 Public Shares ), which included the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 5,250,000
Units, at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 402,500,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
we consummated the sale of 1,778,750 units (each, a Private Placement Unit at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit
in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 17,787,500. 

Transaction costs
amounted to 24,712,590, consisting of 7,000,000 of underwriting fees, 17,150,000 of deferred underwriting fees, 6,860,000 of
deferred advisory fees, and 3,362,590 of other offering costs, net of a 9,660,000 reimbursement for the financial advisory
fee. 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise
of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Placement Units, a total of 408,537,500 10.15 per Unit) was placed in the
Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a
Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below. 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had 557,193 in cash and working capital of 487,895, net of franchise taxes payable and income taxes payable. Prior to the completion
of our Initial Public Offering, our liquidity needs had been satisfied through a capital contribution from the Sponsor of 25,000 and
a loan to us of up to 300,000 by our Sponsor under an unsecured promissory note, which had no outstanding balance as of December 31,
2022. The outstanding balance under the promissory note of 122,926 was paid in full on November 23, 2021 and the promissory note was
terminated, and is no longer available to be drawn upon. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, investments and marketable
securities held in the Trust Account of 413,569,723. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including
any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account to complete our Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the
Trust Account to pay our taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we withdrew 860,446 of interest income from the Trust Account
for that purpose. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business
Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

44 

We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily
to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices,
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material
agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business
Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor, or certain of our directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust
Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside
the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 2,000,000
of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit, at the option of the lender at the time of the Business Combination.
The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our
Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek
access to funds in our Trust Account. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no such loans were outstanding. 

We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order
to meet the expenditures required for operating our business through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one
year from the date of the financial statements. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth
due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds
available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete
our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business
Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance
with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination.
If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease
operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need
to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

Going Concern 

We have until August 23, 2023
to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain whether we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a
Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. We had working
capital of 487,895, net of income taxes payable and franchise taxes payable, as of December 31, 2022; however, we will incur additional
expenses as it relates to the consummation of a business combination. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory
liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. We intend to consummate a Business Combination by August 23, 2023. No adjustments have been made to the
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after August 23, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered
off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose
of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any
special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term
debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor or an
affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of 40,000 for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services to the Company.
We began incurring these fees on November 19, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of
the Business Combination and our liquidation. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred and paid 480,000 in fees for these services.
For the period from January 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021, we incurred 61,935 in fees for these services. 

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November
18, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units (including securities contained therein) and warrants that may be
issued upon conversion of loans made by the Sponsor or one of its affiliates have registration rights to require us to register a sale
of any of our securities held by them (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to the Class A common stock). These holders
are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company registers such securities for sale
under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have piggy-back registration rights to include such securities in other
registration statements we file and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act. 

45 

The underwriter agreed to defer until consummation of the Business
Combination 17,150,000 of its underwriting commissions, which equals 4.0 of the gross proceeds from the Units sold to the public, excluding
any Units purchased pursuant to the underwriter s overallotment option, and 6.0 of the gross proceeds from the Units sold to the
public pursuant to the underwriter s overallotment option. This amount was placed in the Trust Account and will be released to the
underwriter only on completion of an initial Business Combination. 

We engaged Cohen Company Capital Markets, a division of
J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC CCM ), to provide financial advisory services in connection with the Initial Public Offering.
We paid CCM a fee in an amount equal to 0.8 of the aggregate proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (excluding the proceeds of the exercise
of the overallotment option) net of underwriter s expenses, upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. We also engaged CCM
to act as an advisor in connection with the Business Combination for which it will earn an advisory fee of 1.6 of the proceeds of the
Initial Public Offering (excluding the proceeds of the exercise of the overallotment option) payable at closing of the Business Combination.
CCM is also entitled to an advisory fee equal to 2.4 of the aggregate proceeds of the exercise of the overallotment option, payable at
the closing of the Business Combination. The underwriter has agreed to reimburse us for the fee to CCM as it becomes payable out of the
underwriting commissions, including the deferred underwriting commissions payable at closing of the Business Combination. Accordingly,
a reimbursement receivable and deferred advisory fee of 6,860,000 has been reflected in the accompanying balance sheets. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. 

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the
date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or
more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We have identified the
following as our critical accounting policies: 

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption
in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity. Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value.
Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are within the control of the holder
or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified in temporary equity. At
all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights
that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022
and 2021, 40,250,000 shares of Class A common stock are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders 
deficit section of our balance sheets. 

We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they
occur and adjust the carrying value of redeemable Class A common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period.
Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable Class A common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital
and accumulated deficit. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Stock 

We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class
A common stock and Class B common stock. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. We have not considered
the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 21,014,375 shares
of our Class A common stock in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, since their exercise is contingent upon future
events. As a result, diluted net income (loss) per share is the same as basic net income (loss) per share. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which
simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. ASU 2020-06 removes
certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it also simplifies
the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if
any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

46 

We do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. 

This information appears following Item 15 of this Annual
Report and is included herein by reference. 

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures
that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act,
such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our
 Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and
instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control
over financial reporting was effective. 

This Report does not include
an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm, because as an emerging growth company under
the JOBS Act our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to issue such an attestation report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most
recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

of the second class of directors, consisting of Daniel Cohen, Ryan Gilbert and Volker Berl, will expire at our second annual meeting of
stockholders. 

Collectively, through their
positions described above, our officers and directors have extensive experience in public companies and in the financial technology industry.
These individuals play a key role in identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, selecting the target businesses, and
structuring, negotiating and consummating their acquisition. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of any publicly traded class of our equity
securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of equity securities of the Company with the SEC. Officers, directors,
and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders are required by the SEC s regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section
16(a) forms that they file. 

Based solely upon a review
of Forms 3 and Forms 4 furnished to the Company during the most recent fiscal year, and Forms 5 with respect to its most recent fiscal
year, we believe that all such forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were timely filed by the officers,
directors, and security holders required to file the same during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Board Committees 

Audit Committee 

Subject to phase-in rules
and a limited exception, the rules of NASDAQ and Section 10A of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company
be comprised solely of independent directors. We have established an audit committee of the board of directors, which consists of Rochael
Adranly, Lynn Eisenhart and Volker Berl, all of whom meet the independent director standard under NASDAQ s listing standards and
under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Berl serves as Chairman of our audit committee. 

The audit committee s
duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to: 

reviewing and discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm our annual audited financial statements, and recommending to the board whether the audited financial statements should be included in our Form 10-K; 

discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of our financial statements; 

discussing with management major risk assessment and risk management policies; 

monitoring the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm; 

verifying the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit as required by law; 

reviewing and approving all related-party transactions; 

inquiring and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

pre-approving all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed; 

appointing or replacing the independent registered public accounting firm; 

determining the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work; 

establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and 

approving reimbursement of expenses incurred by our management team in identifying potential target businesses. 

Financial Expert on Audit Committee 

The audit committee will at
all times be composed exclusively of directors who are financially literate as defined under NASDAQ s listing standards.
The NASDAQ listing standards define financially literate as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements,
including a company s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. 

In addition, we must certify
to the NASDAQ Global Market that the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience
in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results
in the individual s financial sophistication. We have determined that Mr. Berl satisfies NASDAQ s definition of financial
sophistication and also qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under rules and regulations of the
SEC. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors, which consists of Lynn Eisenhart and Stephen Lefkovits, each of whom meets the independent director
standard under NASDAQ s listing standards and under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Lefkovits serves as Chairman of our
compensation committee. 

51 

The compensation committee s
duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer s based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers; 

reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees; 

producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors; and 

monitoring compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act relating to loans to directors and officers, and with all other applicable laws affecting employee compensation and benefits. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
other than the payment to our sponsor or its affiliate of 40,000 per month, up to the end of the completion window , for office space,
administrative and shared personnel support services, at the option of our management team, a customary advisory fee, if any, to affiliates
of our sponsor at the closing of our initial business combination, in an amount that constitutes a market standard advisory fee for comparable
transactions and services provided, payment of customary fees for financial advisory services (including to CCM), and reimbursement of
expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders,
officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to complete the consummation
of a business combination. Any advisory fee payable to an affiliate of our sponsor will be negotiated on an arms-length basis and will
require the approval of our audit committee. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination,
the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into
in connection with the initial business combination. 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or
other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However,
before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by NASDAQ and the SEC. 

Other Board Committees 

We do not have a standing
nominating committee. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the NASDAQ Rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend
a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily
carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. 

Code of Conduct and Ethics 

We have adopted a code of
conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, a copy of
which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. We will make a printed copy of our code of conduct and ethics available to any stockholder
who so requests. Requests for a printed copy may be directed to us as follows: FTAC Zeus Acquisition Corp., 2929 Arch Street, Suite 1703,
Philadelphia, PA 19104 Attention: Secretary. 

52 

Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

None of our officers or directors
have received any cash compensation from us for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting
fees will be paid to our sponsor, executive officers, and directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, for services rendered
prior to or in connection with the consummation of an initial business combination other than (i) our sponsor s allocation of 25,000
founder shares to each independent director; (ii) repayment of loans made to us prior to the date of the initial public offering by our
sponsor to cover offering-related and organization expenses; (iii) repayment of loans that our sponsor, members of our management
team or any of their respective affiliates may make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination
(provided that if we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay
such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment); (iv) payments to our sponsor or its affiliate
of a total of 40,000 per month for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services; (v) at the closing of our initial
business combination, at the option of our management team, a customary advisory fee, if any, to affiliates of our sponsor, in an amount
that constitutes a market standard advisory fee for comparable transactions and services provided (the fees of which are not currently
estimable and have no established limits); (vi) payment of customary fees for financial advisory services (including to CCM); and
(vii) to reimburse for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigation and completing an initial business combination.
The audit committee will approve all payments in excess of 5,000 to any initial stockholder, sponsor, our directors and officers or our
or their affiliates. Any advisory fee payable to an affiliate of our sponsor will be negotiated on an arms-length basis and will
require the approval of our audit committee. 

After the consummation of
our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain in one of those capacities may be paid director,
consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the
extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed
business combination. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, as it will be up to the directors of the
post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. 

Any compensation to be paid
to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted
solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

We do not intend to take any
action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to
remain with us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements may influence
our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business although we do not believe that the ability of our management
to remain with us after the consummation of an initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with
any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits
upon termination of employment. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation 

No member of the compensation
committee serves or served during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee
of a company that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or compensation committee. 

Item 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN
BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS. 

The following table sets forth
information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 13, 2023, by: 

each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding shares of common stock; 

each of our named executive officers and directors that beneficially owns shares of our common stock; and 

all our executive officers and directors as a group. 

The table below represents
beneficial ownership of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting together as
a single class, and is reported in accordance with the beneficial ownership rules of the SEC under which a person is deemed to be the
beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power with respect to such security or has the
right to acquire such ownership within 60 days. The table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of any outstanding
warrants as no warrants are exercisable within 60 days. 

The beneficial ownership of
the Company s voting common stock is based on 42,028,750 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 14,009,583 shares of
Class B common stock outstanding, except as otherwise indicated.

Item 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

Related Party Policy 

We have adopted a code of
conduct and ethics requiring us to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved
by our board of directors (or the appropriate committee of the board) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our code
of conduct and ethics, conflict of interest situations include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness
or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the Company. 

In addition, our audit committee,
pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter
into such transactions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum
is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of
the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. We also require each of our directors
and officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. 
These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents
a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that
were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. 

Founder shares 

In February 2021, our sponsor
purchased 17,333,333 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000. In October 2021, our sponsor transferred back to us 5,302,500
founder shares for no consideration. In November 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 0.1644733 shares of Class B common stock for
each share of Class B common stock outstanding before the dividend. As a result, our initial stockholders hold 14,009,583 founder shares. 
The number of founder shares was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 25 of the aggregate of our
founder shares, the placement shares and our issued and outstanding public shares after the initial public offering. The founder shares
represent 100 of our issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock. 

Our sponsor and our officers
and directors have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares (except to permitted transferees) (i) with respect
to 25 of such shares, until consummation of our initial business combination, (ii) with respect to 25 of such shares, until the closing
price of our Class A common stock exceeds 12.00 for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period following the consummation of
a business combination, (iii) with respect to 25 of such shares, until the closing price of our Class A common stock exceeds 13.50 for
any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period following the consummation of a business combination, and (iv) with respect to 25 
of such shares, until the closing price of our Class A common stock exceeds 15.00 for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period
following the consummation of a business combination or earlier, in any case, if, following a business combination, we complete a liquidation,
merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to
exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with an initial
business combination, the initial holders may transfer, assign or sell their founder shares with our consent to any person or entity that
agrees in writing to be bound by the transfer restrictions set forth in the prior sentence. 

Private Placement 

Simultaneously with the initial
public offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 1,778,750 placement units at a price of 10.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase
price of 17,787,500. Each placement unit consists of one placement share and one-half of one placement warrant to purchase one share
of our Class A common stock exercisable at 11.50. The proceeds from the placement units and the proceeds from the initial public offering
(initially totaling 408,537,500 10.15 per unit)) are held in the trust account. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to the founder shares, placement shares or placement warrants, which will expire worthless if we do
not complete an initial business combination. 

The placement warrants are
identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the initial public offering, except that if held by the initial purchasers or
their permitted transferees, they (including our common stock issuable upon exercise of the placement warrants) may not, subject to certain
limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the consummation of our initial business combination.
There are no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the founder shares, placement shares or warrants, which will
expire worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. 

55 

Promissory Note Related Party 

Prior to the closing of the
initial public offering, our sponsor loaned us 246,112 for expenses related to our formation and the initial public offering. The loan
was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earlier of March 31, 2022 or the closing of the initial public offering. The loan was
repaid following the closing of the initial public offering on November 23, 2021. 

Related Party Loans 

In order to finance transaction
costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business combination, we would
repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to the Company. If we do not consummate an initial business
combination, we may use a portion of any working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts; however, no proceeds
from the trust account may be used for such repayment. If such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts, the unpaid amounts would
be forgiven. Up to 2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender at
the time of the business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. There were no working capital loans outstanding
as of December 31, 2022. 

Registration Rights 

Pursuant to a registration
rights agreement entered into on November 18, 2021, the holders of the founder shares, placement units (including any securities contained
therein) and the units (including any securities contained therein) that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans are entitled
to registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of our securities held by them (in the case of the founder shares, only
after conversion to our Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short
form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with
respect to registration statements filed by us and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under
the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection
with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Administrative Services 

Commencing on November 19,
2021, we pay an amount equal to 40,000 per month to our sponsor or its affiliate for office space, administrative and shared personnel
support services provided to us. Upon completion of a business combination or its liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly
fees. 

Financial Advisory Fee 

The Company engaged Cohen
 Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC CCM ), to provide financial advisory services in
connection with the initial public offering. The Company paid CCM a fee in an amount equal to 0.8 of the aggregate proceeds of the initial
public offering (excluding the proceeds of the exercise of the overallotment option) net of underwriter s expenses, upon the closing
of the initial public offering. The Company also engaged CCM to act as an advisor in connection with the business combination for which
it will earn an advisory fee of 1.6 of the proceeds of the initial public offering (excluding the proceeds of the exercise of the overallotment
option) payable at closing of the business combination. CCM is also entitled to an advisory fee equal to 2.4 of the aggregate proceeds
of the exercise of the overallotment option, payable at the closing of the business combination. The underwriter has agreed to reimburse
us for the fee to CCM as it becomes payable out of the underwriting commissions, including the deferred underwriting commissions payable
at the closing of the business combination. 

Trust Account Indemnification 

FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC has
agreed that, if the trust account is liquidated without the consummation of a business combination, it will indemnify us to the extent
any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or any claims by a prospective target business with which we
have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below 10.15 per public share,
except for any claims by any third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account, regardless of
whether such waiver is enforceable, and except for claims arising from our obligation to indemnify the underwriter of the initial public
offering pursuant to the underwriting agreement. We have not independently verified whether FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC has sufficient funds
to satisfy its indemnity obligations, we have not asked FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC to reserve for such obligations and we believe that its
only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC will be able to satisfy those obligations.
We believe the likelihood of FTAC Zeus Sponsor, LLC having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we endeavor to have all third
parties that provide products or services to us and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. 

56 

Conflicts of Interest 

In general, officers and directors
of a Delaware corporation are required to present business opportunities to the corporation if: 

the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity; 

the opportunity is within the corporation s line of business; and 

it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides, however, that the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, does not apply to us
or any of our officers or directors or in circumstances that would conflict with any current or future fiduciary duties or contractual
obligations. 

Accordingly, if any of our
officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which
he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present the opportunity to such entity prior
to presenting the opportunity to us or, if he or she is subject to a non-compete obligation that includes business opportunities, he or
she may be prohibited from referring such opportunity to us. Below is a table summarizing the companies to which our officers and directors
owe fiduciary obligations that could conflict with their fiduciary obligations to us, all of which may have to (i) be presented appropriate
potential target businesses by our officers or directors, and (ii) reject the opportunity to acquire such potential target business, before
the opportunity may be presented to us:

above officers or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which
he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity, subject
to his or her fiduciary duties. We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will
materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination, because, although many of the foregoing entities are involved
in the financial services industry broadly defined, the specific industry focuses of a majority of these entities differ from our focus
on financial technology businesses and the type or size of the transaction that such companies would most likely consider are of a size
and nature substantially different than what we are targeting. 

Each of our sponsor, officers
and directors may become involved with subsequent blank check companies similar to our company. As a result, our sponsor, officers or
directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other
blank check company with which they may become involved. In particular, an affiliate of our sponsor is currently sponsoring other blank
check companies, each of which is seeking to complete a business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest
in pursuing an acquisition target. 

Director Independence 

NASDAQ rules require that
a majority of the board of directors of a company listed on NASDAQ must be composed of independent directors, which is defined
generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship,
which, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We have determined that Rochael Adranly, Lynn Eisenhart, Stephen Lefkovits and Volker
Berl are independent directors under the NASDAQ rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. 

Item 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND
SERVICES. 

The firm of WithumSmith+Brown,
PC, or Withum, acted as our independent registered public accounting firm during the period from January 1, 2021 (commencement of operations)
through December 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Withum
for services rendered. 

Audit Fees 

Audit fees consist of fees
billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by
Withum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by Withum for professional services rendered for the audit of
our annual financial statements, the initial public offering and other required filings with the SEC for the period from January 1, 2021
(commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled approximately 124,630 and
 88,400, respectively. 

Audit-Related Fees 

Audit-related services consist
of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements
and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation
and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We did not pay Withum for any audit-related services during
the period from January 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 or for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Tax Fees 

For the period from January
1, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, fees for services rendered
to us for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning by Withum were approximately 0 and 16,200, respectively. 

All Other Fees 

We did not pay Withum for
other services for the period from January 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 or for the year ended December
31, 2022. 

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 

Our audit committee was formed
upon the consummation of the initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services,
although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation
of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted
non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions
for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 

FTAC
Zeus Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of FTAC Zeus Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022
and for the period from January 1, 2021 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 1, 2021 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2021,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company
is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a Business Combination by August
23, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed
on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally
 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise
tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value
of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the
Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the
