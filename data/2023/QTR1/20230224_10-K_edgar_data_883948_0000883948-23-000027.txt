 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Form 10-K may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that include, without limitation, statements regarding anticipated changes in the interest rate environments, future economic conditions and the impacts of current economic uncertainties, and projections, predictions, expectations, or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. Such forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions as of the time they are made, and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Actual future results, performance, achievements or trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the effects of or changes in: market interest rates and their related impacts on macroeconomic conditions, customer and client behavior, our funding costs, and our loan and securities portfolios; inflation and its impacts on economic growth and customer and client behavior; general economic and financial market conditions, in the United States generally and particularly in the markets in which we operate and which our loans are concentrated, including the effects of declines in real estate values, an increase in unemployment levels and slowdowns in economic growth; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve; the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios and changes therein; demand for loan products and financial services in our market areas; our ability to manage our growth or implement our growth strategy; the effectiveness of expense reduction plans; the introduction of new lines of business or new products and services; our ability to recruit and retain key employees; an insufficient ACL; changes in accounting principles, standards, rules, and interpretations, and the related impact on our financial statements; volatility in the ACL resulting from the CECL methodology, either alone or as that may be affected by conditions arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, changing interest rates, or other factors; our liquidity and capital positions; concentrations of loans secured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate; the effectiveness of our credit processes and management of our credit risk; our ability to compete in the market for financial services and increased competition from fintech companies; technological risks and developments, and cyber threats, attacks, or events; operational, technological, cultural, regulatory, legal, credit, and other risks associated with the exploration, consummation and integration of potential future acquisitions, whether involving stock or cash considerations; the potential adverse effects of unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, terrorist acts, geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine) or public health events (such as COVID-19), and of governmental and societal responses thereto; these potential adverse effects may include, without limitation, adverse effects on the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations to us, on the value of collateral securing loans, on the demand for our loans or our other products and services, on supply chains and methods used to distribute products and services, on incidents of cyberattack and fraud, on our liquidity or capital positions, on risks posed by reliance on third-party service providers, or on other aspects of our business operations and on financial markets and economic growth; the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;

 SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS An investment in our securities involves risks, including those summarized below. For a more complete discussion of these risk factors, see Item 1A Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Lending Activities Our ACL may be insufficient to absorb credit losses in our loan portfolio. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate , and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business. We have significant credit exposure in commercial real estate, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our commercial and industrial loans have contributed significantly to our loan growth, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The loans we make through federal programs are dependent on the federal government s continuation and support of these programs and on our compliance with program requirements. We use independent appraisals and other valuation techniques in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real estate and other real estate owned, which may not accurately describe the net value of the asset. If we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer. Our focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk. Nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our profits, and w e may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to environmental risks. Risks Related to Market Interest Rates Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our income and cash flows. We may incur losses if asset values decline, including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. We are required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index, which could negatively impact our net income and requires significant operational work. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Markets Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions generally. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or access other low-cost funding sources. We face substantial competition that could adversely affect our growth and/or operating results. Consumers may increasingly decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Operations A failure and/or breach of our operating or securities systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in a disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our employees and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, terrorist activities, and identity theft, that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. Our business strategy includes continued growth, and our financial condition and results of operation could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We face risks with respect to future expansion, which could disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value. The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected. Our risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses.

 Failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business and competitive position. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure, and our business could be adversely affected by the operational functions of such counterparties. We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and our financial condition could be adversely affected if we rely on misleading information. We are subject to losses due to errors, omissions or fraudulent behavior by our employees, clients, counterparties or other third parties. Competition for talent is substantial. If we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate our human capital, our business, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. Our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation. Our business needs and future growth may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive. We are or may become involved from time to time to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business or information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences, which may lead to expenses and ultimate exposures that cannot be ascertained and/or other adverse consequences. We are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax assets. Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities. Current and to-be-effective laws and regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs and failure to comply with such laws and regulation could impact our business, financial condition, and reputation. We are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected. We are subject to the CFPB s broad regulatory and enforcement authority and new regulations, and new approaches to regulation or enforcement by the CFPB could adversely impact us. We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, and any deemed deficiency by the Bank with respect to these laws could result in significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business strategy. We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a material penalties and other sanctions. The Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank. Risks Related to Our Securities Our ability to pay dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay dividends in the future. The trading volumes in our common stock may not provide adequate liquidity for investors. Future capital needs could result in dilution of shareholder investment and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock (or depositary shares) . Holders of our indebtedness and of depositary shares related to our Series A preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders. Our governing documents and certain provisions of Virginia law could have an anti-takeover affect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of the Company that you may favor. Our stock price may be volatile , which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us . General Risk Factors New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk. Failure to maintain our reputation may materially adversely affect our performance. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings. We are subject to risks associated with climate change and other weather and natural disaster impacts. We are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation, the trading price of our common stock and/or our business, operations, and earnings.

 PART I In this Form 10-K, unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms we, us and our refer to Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Atlantic Union Bank. ITEM 1. - BUSINESS. GENERAL Overview Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation is a financial holding company and bank holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and registered under the BHCA. We are headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and provide a wide range of financial services and products to commercial and retail clients through our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Atlantic Union Bank, a Federal Reserve member bank charted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Bank is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and, as of December 31, 2022, operated 114 branches and approximately 130 ATMs located throughout Virginia, and portions of Maryland, and North Carolina. In addition, our non-bank financial services affiliates include: Atlantic Union Equipment Finance, Inc., which provides equipment financing; Atlantic Union Financial Consultants LLC, which provides brokerage services; and Union Insurance Group, LLC, which offers various lines of insurance products. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 20.5 billion in assets, 14.4 billion in LHFI (net of deferred fees and costs), 15.9 billion in deposits, and 2.4 billion in stockholders equity. History The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1991, and we completed our bank holding company formation in July 1993, in connection with the merger of Northern Neck Bankshares Corporation with and into Union Bancorp, Inc. to form Union Bankshares Corporation, which was renamed Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation in 2019. Union Bank Trust Company, a predecessor of Atlantic Union Bank, was formed in 1902, and certain other of the community banks that were acquired and ultimately merged to form what is now Atlantic Union Bank were among the oldest in Virginia at the time they were acquired. We have a history of growing through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions, particularly with our three most recent acquisitions StellarOne Corporation in 2014, Xenith Bankshares, Inc. in 2018, and Access National Corporation in 2019 which allowed us to meaningfully increase our asset size, enhance our scale and expand our footprint throughout Virginia and into portions of Maryland and North Carolina.

Effective June 30, 2022, we completed the sale of DHFB, which was formerly a subsidiary of the Bank that operated as a registered investment advisory firm, to Cary Street Partners Financial LLC. In the transaction, we received a minority ownership stake in Cary Street Partners Financial LLC, which is a registered investment advisory firm. Principal Products and Services We are a full-service bank offering consumers and businesses a wide range of banking and related financial services, including checking, savings, certificates of deposit, and other depository services, as well as loans for commercial, industrial, residential mortgage, and consumer purposes. In addition, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we offer equipment financing services, wealth management, and insurance products. Our customers have access to our products and services in-person via our full-service branches and ATMs, and virtually through our mobile and internet banking services. We strive to provide a differentiated customer experience that is authentically human and digital forward. Lending Activities. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial, industrial, residential mortgage, and consumer loans. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio is represented by commercial and residential real estate loans (including acquisition and development loans and residential construction loans). The ability of our borrowers to honor their contracts on such loans is dependent on the real estate and general economic conditions in those markets, as well as other factors. The majority of our commercial real estate and industrial loans are made to customers in Virginia and portions of Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina, as we have loan production offices in North Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Mortgage Banking. Our mortgage division, Atlantic Union Bank Home Loans, originates the majority of our residential mortgage loans to borrowers nationwide, largely with the intent to sell such loans into the secondary mortgage markets. We do originate certain mortgage loans to our customers within our branch footprint to hold for investment. Equipment Finance. We provide equipment financing to commercial and corporate customers nationwide through Atlantic Union Equipment Finance, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. Atlantic Union Equipment Finance provides financing for a wide array of equipment types, including marine, tractors, trailers, buses, construction, manufacturing, and medical. Wealth Management, Trust and Insurance . Our wealth management division, which operates under the brand Atlantic Union Bank Wealth Management, offers a wide variety of financial planning, wealth management and trust services to individuals and corporations primarily within Virginia and portions of North Carolina and Maryland. Our wealth management division allows us to reach new customers and expand product offerings to our existing loan and deposit customers. We offer financial planning, trust and investment management, and retirement planning services through our

 team of experienced financial advisors. Through Atlantic Union Financial Consultants, LLC, we offer brokerage services and execute securities transactions through Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., an independent broker dealer. Our insurance division, Union Insurance Group, LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank that operates under an agreement with Bankers Insurance LLC, a large insurance agency owned by community banks across Virginia and managed by the Virginia Bankers Association. Union Insurance Group generates revenue through the sale of various insurance products through Bankers Insurance LLC, including long-term care insurance and business owner policies. Deposit Products, Treasury Services and Other Funding Sources. Our primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities are our deposit products. We provide both commercial and consumer customers a diverse array of deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit, among others. Our deposits are primarily made to customers based in Virginia and portions of Maryland and North Carolina. In addition, we provide our customers a suite of products and service including credit cards through an arrangement with Elan Financial Services, treasury management services, and capital market services, among others. SEGMENTS Before the third quarter of 2022, we had only one reportable operating segment, the Bank. However, effective in the third quarter of 2022, we completed system conversions that allows us to evaluate our business, establish our overall business strategy, allocate resources, and assess our business performance within two primary reportable operating segments: Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking, with corporate support functions such as corporate treasury and others included in Corporate Other. Our Wholesale Banking segment provides loan and deposit services, as well as treasury management and capital market services to our wholesale customers primarily throughout Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These customers include commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. This segment also includes our public finance subsidiary and our equipment finance subsidiary, Atlantic Union Equipment Finance, which operates nationwide. Our Consumer Banking segment provides loan and deposit services to consumers and small businesses throughout Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Consumer Banking includes our home loan division and our wealth management division, which consists of private banking, trust, and brokerage services. EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS We have expanded our market area and increased our market share through a combination of organic growth (internal growth and de novo expansion) and strategic mergers and acquisitions. To date, our strategic acquisitions have included whole bank acquisitions, branch and deposit acquisitions, purchases of existing branches from other banks, and registered investment advisory firms. Our merger and acquisition strategy has focused on institutions that are a strong cultural fit and that are consistent with our philosophy of soundness, profitability and growth. We expect to continue to assess future strategic opportunities based on market and other conditions, applying a number of criteria: including transactions that: enhance our footprint, allowing for cost savings and economies of scale, or allow us to expand into contiguous markets, or that otherwise may be strategically compelling (such as transactions that diversify our revenue streams) or add attractive business lines, products, services or technological capabilities; meet our financial criteria; and are consistent with our risk appetite. 
 These transactions may include whole bank and non-bank mergers and acquisitions, minority investments, or strategic partner equity investments.

In order to accomplish this, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain talent who desire to enrich the lives of the people and communities that we serve. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create an inclusive, diverse, safe and healthy workplace, that provides opportunities for our teammates to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. Employee Profile As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,877 full-time equivalent employees (which we refer to as teammates ). None of our teammates are represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce was comprised of approximately 65 women and 23 self-identified minorities, and the average tenure of our teammates was 7.3 years.

 We embrace diversity of thought and identity to better serve our stakeholders and achieve our purpose. We are committed to cultivating an inclusive and welcoming workplace where teammate and customer perspectives are valued and respected. We also seek to foster a culture of giving back to the communities where our customers live, work, and play. Charitable donations, small business lending, volunteerism, teaching financial literacy and promoting diversity and inclusion within our communities, are some of the ways we give back. Compensation and Benefits Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate high performing talent and provide market aligned pay programs in support of our business strategies. Our compensation programs are tied to both individual and corporate performances. In addition, we use the services of a compensation consultant to advise us on compensation practices and other consultants and regularly benchmarks our compensation and benefits program against our peers. Our compensation policies and procedures are designed to seek to ensure proper governance and acceptable levels of risk. Individual teammate total pay is influenced by the nature and scope of the job, what other employers pay for comparable jobs, experience and individual performance. We have established minimum wage levels for all jobs through a formal salary structure that sets a defined salary range for each position. We also offer annual merit-based salary increases to eligible teammates. Approximately 65 of our teammates are provided with an incentive opportunity under a formal incentive plan with measurable goals and metrics. All incentive programs have both upside and downside potential and are linked to both the individual s and our performances. Teammates who are not eligible for an incentive plan are eligible to receive cash profit sharing based on our overall financial performance.

 We believe that our teammates are best able to deliver a great customer experience if they feel healthy and secure. We offer a variety of benefit programs that flex to meet the needs of our diverse and multigenerational population, as we strive for a differentiated and personalized experience and to deliver what is most important to teammates throughout the various stages of their lives and careers. We share in the benefit costs with teammates in a way that supports mutual fiscal responsibility, and we seek to assist our teammates in managing health care costs through programs that focus on wellness improvement and appropriate use of health care services. Our benefits programs include a Company-maintained ESOP, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, inclusive parental leave, a 401(k) Plan Company match, flexible work arrangements, Employee Assistance Programs and tuition expense reimbursements. We also offer a holistic wellbeing program that provides opportunities for teammates to earn financial incentives by participating in wellness activities designed to build and sustain healthy habits. Talent Development and Training We believe our human capital is our most important asset, and we are committed to investing in the growth and development of our teammates. We have a performance development program that encourages teammate development through mentoring and ongoing conversations with their supervisors to seek to align our business objectives with our teammates personal development and career aspirations. Our performance development program is very important to delivering business results and helps gain greater alignment between strategic goals and individual goals. This program operates on an annual basis and begins with each teammate setting their own individual goals and development plans and ends with an annual review. Teammates are encouraged to take ownership of their development and seek guidance from their managers on goals and development areas. We also provide training opportunities to foster teammate growth and development, enhance teammate skillsets, and prepare teammates to be successful in their roles. For example, we offer specific, targeted training to all new hires. In addition to professional development, role-based, and regulatory/compliance training, we also offer training resources on the following subjects: leadership; diversity, equity, and inclusion; policies/procedures; information security; anti-bribery; ethics; product training; anti-money-laundering; technical/systems; and compensation/benefits. We also offer an enterprise development program, Emerge, intended to engage and retain high potential talent and broaden career mobility within and across lines of business. All teammates have access to training opportunities through a learning management system and/or learning experience platform. We offer training through multiple modalities, including e-learning, job aids, videos, instructor-led, and on-the-job practice supported by trained mentors. The majority of our training materials are regulation-based and managed through a regulatory and compliance program. In addition to job specific training, all teammates are required to complete mandatory compliance courses on a wide range of Company policies and procedures, such as our anti-discrimination policies and ethical standards and in response to regulatory requirements and changes.

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We are committed to hiring diverse talent and fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of a diversity, equity and inclusion. We believe that the collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities, and talent that our teammates invest in their work represents a significant part of not only our culture, but our reputation and achievement. We strive to foster a culture and workplace that, among other things, is inclusive and welcoming, treats everyone with respect and dignity, promotes people on their merits, and promotes diversity of thoughts, ideas, perspective and values. Our Board believes that diversity contributes to the overall effectiveness of the Board and generally conceptualizes diversity expansively to include, without limitation, concepts such as race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, age, work experience, professional skills, geographic location and other qualities or attributes that contribute to Board heterogeneity. We have a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, which we refer to as our DEI Council, led by the Bank s President and includes a cross-functional group of teammates from diverse backgrounds, that manages our efforts to create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. We also have provided Employee Resource Groups, which we welcome all teammates and allies to join. Our current Employee Resource Groups include the Women s Inclusion Network; Allies of Individuals Differently Abled; AUB Gets Vets; and Black Teammates United in Leadership and Development, all of which offer professional development opportunities such as mentoring, skill building and partnering to acquire talent and meet business goals. COMPETITION The financial services industry remains highly competitive and is constantly evolving. We experience strong competition in all aspects of our business. In our market areas, we compete with large national and regional financial institutions, credit unions, other independent community banks, as well as consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, loan production offices, mutual funds, life insurance companies and fintech companies. Competition for deposits and loans is affected by various factors including, without limitation, interest rates offered, the number and location of branches and types of products offered, digital capabilities, and the reputation of the institution. Credit unions increasingly have been allowed to expand their membership definitions, and because they enjoy a favorable tax status, they may be able to offer more attractive loan and deposit pricing. Our non-bank affiliates also operate in highly competitive environments. In addition, nonbank competitors are increasingly offering products and services that traditionally were only offered by banks. Many of these nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks, which may allow them to offer greater lending limits and certain products and services that we do not provide. We believe our community focused banking framework and philosophy provides us with a competitive advantage, particularly with regard to larger national and regional institutions, allowing us to compete effectively. Additionally, our attention to incorporating digital technology has made it possible for us to provide our customers with electronic, mobile, and internet-based financial solutions, such as online deposit accounts and electronic payment processing. Our deposit market share in Virginia was 4.1 of total bank deposits as of June 30, 2022, making us the largest regional bank headquartered in Virginia at that time. ECONOMY The economies in our market areas are diverse and include local and federal government, military, agriculture, and manufacturing. Based on Virginia Employment Commission data, the state s seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 3.0 as of December 31, 2022, compared to 3.2 at December 31, 2021 and continued to be below the national rate of 3.5 at December 31, 2022. Our operations are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. Since the beginning of 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 425 bps as of December 31, 2022 and is expected to continue increasing rates throughout the first half of 2023. Generally, we expect to benefit from a rising rate environment given our interest rate risk profile; however, rising interest rates may have an adverse impact on the ability of our borrowers with floating rate loans to repay their loans. Additionally, rising rates may have an adverse impact on our deposit and borrowing costs.

 Our management continues to consider COVID-19, the current economic environment, and potential future economic conditions, including the threat of an economic recession on our performance, while also seeking to address nonperforming assets, control costs, and work with borrowers to mitigate and protect against risk of loss. Our management also continues to review the pricing of our products and services, in light of current and expected costs due to inflation, to seek to mitigate the inflationary impact on our financial performance. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION We are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws. The following description briefly describes certain aspects of those regulations that are material to us and does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations, or aspects of those regulations, that affect us. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals are described in this Form 10-K, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us, are difficult to ascertain. In addition to laws and regulations, bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us. A change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or in the manner such laws, regulations or regulatory guidance are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and earnings. Supervision, regulation, and examination of banks by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the deposit insurance fund and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than shareholders. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years, initially in response to the global financial crisis of 2008, and more recently in light of other factors such as technological and market changes. As described in further detail below, we are subject to additional regulatory requirements because we have over 10 billion in consolidated assets. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations. We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, both as administered by the SEC, as well as the rules of the NYSE that apply to companies with securities listed on the NYSE. The Company General . The Company is registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the BHCA and has elected to be a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, we are subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects financial holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions and qualifications on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities. The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Virginia SCC. Enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banks and financial services firms, such as the Company and the Bank, have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by the federal banking agencies; moreover, certain provisions of the Act that were implemented by federal agencies have been revised or rescinded pursuant to legislative changes adopted by Congress. Permitted Activities . The permitted activities of a bank holding company are limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies, such as the Company, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal

 Reserve), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Activities that are financial in nature include but are not limited to securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments. To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed as defined under applicable Federal Reserve requirements. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may require the financial holding company to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in any activity that is financial in nature (or incident to such financial activity) or complementary to a financial activity. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the CRA. See below under The Bank Community Reinvestment Act. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity. Banking Acquisitions; Changes in Control . The BHCA and related regulations require, among other things, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares), (ii) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, the Federal Reserve will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, any outstanding regulatory compliance issues of any institution that is a party to the transaction, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, the financial condition of each institution that is a party to the transaction and of the combined institution after the transaction, the parties managerial resources and risk management and governance processes and systems, the parties compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, and the acquiring institution s performance under the CRA and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws. On July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which, among other initiatives, encouraged the review of current practices and adoption of a plan for the revitalization of merger oversight under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act. On March 25, 2022, the FDIC published a Request for Information, seeking information and comments regarding the regulatory framework that applies to merger transactions involving one or more insured depository institution. Making any formal changes to the framework for evaluating bank mergers would require an extended process, and any such changes are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. However, the adoption of more expansive or stringent standards may have an impact on our acquisition activity. Additionally, this Executive Order could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies expectations and supervisory oversight for banking acquisitions. Subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company s acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25 or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control may exist if a person or company acquires 10 or more but less than 25 of any class of voting securities and certain other relationships are present between the investor and the bank holding company, or if certain other ownership thresholds for voting or total equity have been exceeded.

 In addition, Virginia law requires the prior approval of the Virginia SCC for (i) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of more than 5 of the voting shares of a Virginia bank or a Virginia bank holding company, or (ii) the acquisition by any other person of control of a Virginia bank holding company or a Virginia bank. Source of Strength . Federal Reserve policy and the Dodd-Frank Act require bank holding companies, such as the Company, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. Safety and Soundness . There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the DIF in the event of a depository institution insolvency, receivership, or default. For example, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become undercapitalized with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5 of the institution s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan. Under the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to capital management, internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, information systems, data security, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure and risk management, vendor management, corporate governance, asset growth and compensation, fees, and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the BHCA, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of qualifying capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are described below under The Bank Capital Requirements . Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, the Company is able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. Limits on Dividends, Capital Distributions and Other Payments . The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, and to the repurchase by the Company of outstanding shares of its capital stock. Federal Reserve policy provides that bank holding companies, such as the Company, should generally pay dividends to shareholders only if (i) the organization s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition; and (iii) the organization will continue to meet minimum capital adequacy ratios. In addition, the Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Under current regulations, prior approval from the Federal Reserve is required if cash dividends declared by the Bank in any given year exceed net income for that year, plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its respective business. The payment of dividends or the repurchase of outstanding capital stock, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become undercapitalized

 (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the Bank s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. The Bank General . The Bank is chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia and is supervised and regularly examined by the Virginia SCC. The Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, is also supervised and regularly examined by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the CFPB, as an institution with more than 10 billion in assets. The various laws and regulations administered by the bank regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, incurrence of debt, and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies; they also affect business practices, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, types of business conducted, and location of offices. Certain of these law and regulations are referenced above under The Company . Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to the Bank and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Under the final rules, which are applicable to financial institutions that have assets of 10 billion or more, the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to the sum of 21 cents plus 5 bps of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. The rules permit an upward adjustment to an issuer s debit card interchange fee of no more than one cent per transaction if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have issued risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. Those regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital requirements and calculations of risk-weighted assets to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under these risk-based capital requirements of the Federal Reserve, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital less certain specified deductions from total capital such as reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments and equity investments) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital (which consists principally of common and certain qualifying preferred shareholders equity (including grandfathered trust preferred securities) as well as retained earnings, less certain intangibles and other adjustments) to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , and (iii) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 . These capital requirements provide that Tier 2 capital consists of cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of subordinated and other qualifying debt (including certain hybrid capital instruments), and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance. The Federal Reserve s capital requirements also impose a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The combined effect of the risk-based capital requirements and the additional 2.5 capital conservation buffer is that the Company and the Bank must maintain (i) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.5 , and (iii) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 7.0 .

Table of Contents 
 The Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios of the Company were 10.93 , 9.95 , and 13.70 , respectively, as of December 31, 2022, thus exceeding the minimum requirements for well capitalized status. The Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios of the Bank were 12.81 , 12.81 , and 13.30 , respectively, as of December 31, 2022, also exceeding the minimum requirements for well capitalized status. Each of the federal bank regulatory agencies also has established a minimum leverage capital ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets Tier 1 leverage ratio ). The guidelines require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3.0 for advanced approach banking organizations; all other banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 . In addition, for a depository institution to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA, its Tier 1 leverage ratio must be at least 5.0 . Banking organizations that have experienced internal growth or made acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve has not advised the Company or the Bank of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to either entity. As of December 31, 2022, the Tier 1 leverage ratios of the Company and the Bank were 9.42 and 11.02 , respectively, well above the minimum requirements. The Federal Reserve s final rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings for a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 for U.S. government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. The Federal Reserve s regulatory capital rules also provide that the Company s trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 2 capital. The Company has 142.7 million of trust preferred securities outstanding and approximately 20.5 billion in assets as of December 31, 2022. On August 26, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a final rule that allowed the Company to phase in the impact of adopting the CECL methodology up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. Refer to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section Capital Resources of this Form 10-K for information regarding the impact of this final rule on the Company s regulatory capital. Deposit Insurance. The Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments based on average total assets minus average tangible equity to maintain the DIF. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is 250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured depository institution, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes. The FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment structure, set a target designated reserve ratio of 2 for the DIF, and in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule, when the reserve ratio reaches 2 and 2.5 . An institution s assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three-year period, which considers the institution s weighted average CAMELS composite rating, which is the rating system bank supervisory authorities use to rate financial institutions, and is subject to further adjustments including related to levels of unsecured debt and brokered deposits. At December 31, 2022, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years with assets of 10 billion or more range from 1.5 to 40 bps. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 bps, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. This increase in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio reaches 1.35 by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2 . Progressively lower assessment rate schedules will take effect when the reserve ratio reaches 2 , and again when it reaches 2.5 . For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred deposit insurance assessment expenses of 8.3 million, 7.8 million, and 8.4 million, respectively.

 Transactions with Affiliates . The authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or affiliates, or to make loans to insiders, is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended and Regulation W. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates. Prompt Corrective Action . Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. Well capitalized institutions may generally operate without additional supervisory restriction. With respect to adequately capitalized institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized, they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and they cannot accept, renew, or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC. Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. The Bank met the definition of being well capitalized as of December 31, 2022. The prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA require for well-capitalized status a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0 , a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 , a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0 , and a minimum total capital ratio of 10.0 . Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the requirements of the CRA. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of the local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. If the Bank receives a rating from the Federal Reserve of less than satisfactory under the CRA, restrictions on operating activities would be imposed. In addition, in order for a financial holding company, like the Company, to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the CRA. The Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating in its most recent examination. The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a joint proposal to strengthen and modernize regulations issued under the CRA, including but not limited to incorporating online and mobile banking, branchless banking and hybrid models into CRA assessment areas. However, making any formal changes to CRA regulations would require an extended process, and any such changes are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. FHLB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development loans. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region, and makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the applicable Federal Home Loan Bank. As a member, the Bank must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. Confidentiality of Customer Information . We are subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of customers. As a financial institution, we must provide to our customers 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 information regarding our policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers personal information. We must also conduct an internal risk assessment of our ability to protect customer information. These privacy laws and regulations generally prohibit financial institutions from providing a customer s personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer. The CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 2018. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions which do not trigger a customer s statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption. These laws and regulations impose compliance costs and create obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with these laws, regulations, and obligations may require us to use significant resources. Data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus. In March 2021, the Governor of Virginia signed into law the VCDPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023. The VCDPA grants Virginia residents the right to access, correct, delete, know, and opt-out of the sale and processing for targeted advertising purposes of their personal information, similar to the protections provided by similar consumer data privacy laws in California and in Europe. The VCDPA also imposes data protection assessment requirements and authorizes the Attorney General of Virginia to enforce the VCDPA, but does not provide a private right of action for consumers. The Bank is exempt from the VCDPA, but certain third-party vendors of the Company or the Bank will be subject to the VCDPA, which could negatively impact the products or services that we obtain from those vendors. Required Disclosure of Customer Information . We are also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act added additional regulations to facilitate information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, imposes standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, and requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. Regulations adopted under the Bank Secrecy Act impose on financial institutions customer due diligence requirements, and the federal banking regulators expect that customer due diligence programs will be integrated within a financial institution s broader BSA/AML compliance program. The OFAC, which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with enemies of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an enemy of the United States on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds into a blocked account, and report it to OFAC. In December 2020, Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021. Among its many provisions, the National Defense Authorization Act includes the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 and the related Corporate Transparency Act of 2019. The Corporate Transparency Act is a significant update to federal BSA/AML regulations that aims to eliminate the use of shell companies that facilitate the laundering of criminal proceeds and, for that purpose, directs FinCEN to establish and maintain a national registry of beneficial ownership information for corporate entities. Specifically, corporations and limited liability companies (subject to certain exceptions) must disclose to FinCEN their beneficial owners defined as an individual who, directly or indirectly, exercises substantial control over the entity or owns or controls not less than 25 of the ownership interests of the entity. Beneficial ownership must be disclosed at the time of company formation and upon a change in ownership. The national registry will be confidential; the Corporate Transparency Act contains criminal penalties for non-compliance as well as for unauthorized disclosure of reported information. On September 29, 2022, FinCEN issued a final rule to implement the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act, which will be effective January 1, 2024. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of this final rule on our BSA/AML policies and procedures. Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of 3 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 of Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds (known as the Volcker Rule ). As implied by the federal bank regulatory agencies, the final rule prohibits banking entities from (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The rule also requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the final rule provides some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to the Company and the Bank. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and subsequent promulgation of inter-agency final rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring requirements related to the Volcker Rule, including by eliminating collection of certain metrics and reducing the compliance burdens associated with other metrics for banks with less than 20 billion in average trading assets and liabilities. Due to the changing regulatory landscape, we will continue to evaluate the implications of the Volcker Rules on our investments, including new impacts as a result of the changes, but we do not expect any material financial implications. Consumer Financial Protection . The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may be subject to various penalties or enforcement actions. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for our proposed merger or acquisition transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. The CFPB is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than 10 billion of assets. The Company and the Bank are subject to federal consumer protection rules enacted by the CFPB and the Bank is subject to examination by the CFPB. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. Further, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB may influence how other regulatory agencies apply the subject consumer financial protection laws and regulations. During the current administration, the CFPB also actively supports enforcement of consumer financial protection laws and regulations by individual states. For example, during 2022, the CFPB issued an interpretative rule stating, in part, that (i) states can enforce the federal Consumer Financial Protection Act, and (ii) CFPB enforcement actions do not put a halt to state enforcement actions. Mortgage Banking Regulation. In connection with making mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and regulations that, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, in some cases restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level. We are also subject to rules and regulations that require the collection and reporting of significant amounts of information with respect to mortgage loans and borrowers. Our mortgage origination activities are subject to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Certain provisions of Regulation Z require creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Creditors are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the creditor to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the creditor can originate qualified mortgages, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3 of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are higher-priced (e.g., subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not higher-priced (e.g., prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. To meet the mortgage credit needs of a broader customer base, we are predominantly an originator of mortgages that are intended to be in compliance with the ability-to-pay requirements. In November 2019, the CFPB issued an interpretive rule providing that loan originators with temporary authority may act as a loan originator for a temporary period of time, as specified in the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, in a state while that state considers their application for a loan originator license, if they meet certain screening and training requirements. Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is well capitalized or, with the FDIC s approval, adequately capitalized. However, as a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the FDIC undertook a comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposits, and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less than well capitalized. On December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued rules to revise brokered deposit regulations in light of modern deposit-taking methods. The rules established a new framework for certain provisions of the deposit broker definition and amended the FDIC s interest rate methodology calculating rates and rate caps. The rules became effective on April 1, 2021. Cybersecurity. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution s operations after a cyberattack. If we fail to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory actions and any remediation efforts may require us to devote significant resources. On November 18, 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents that may affect the U.S. banking system. The rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator of any significant computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a cyber incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. In addition, the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours. The rule became effective May 1, 2022. With 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 increased focus on cybersecurity, we are continuing to monitor legislative, regulatory and supervisory developments related thereto. Incentive Compensation . The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities with at least 1 billion in total consolidated assets, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution. The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward. The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional record-keeping requirements. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed, and a final rule has not yet been published. If the rules are adopted as proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured. Future Regulation From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease our cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies Our operations are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy tools to impact money market and credit market conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant impact on our overall growth and distribution of loans, investments, and deposits; they affect market interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits, and can significantly influence employment and inflation rates. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including us, in the past and are expected to do so in the future. Filings with the SEC Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act are available at no cost on our investor relations website, http://investors.atlanticunionbank.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after we file, or furnish, such documents with the SEC. The information contained on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K, nor incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K or of any other filing with the SEC. Our SEC filings are also available at no cost through the SEC s website at http://www.sec.gov . ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS An investment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties. In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the information addressed under Forward-Looking Statements, investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and could cause our actual results to differ 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, in which case the trading price of our securities could decline. The risk factors discussed below highlight the risks that we believe are material to us, but do not necessarily include all risks that we may face, and an investor in our securities should not interpret the disclosure of a risk in the following risk factors to state or imply that the risk has not already materialized. Risks Related to Our Lending Activities Our ACL may prove to be insufficient to absorb credit losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like all financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. We maintain an ACL, which includes the ALLL, at a level we believe is adequate to absorb expected losses in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. The process to determine the ACL uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated. This includes forecasting how borrowers will perform in changing and unprecedented economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators, to accurately estimate the timing of future changes in economic conditions, or to estimate accurately the impacts of future changes in economic conditions to our borrowers, which similarly could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. If the models, estimates, and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers prove inaccurate in predicting future events, we may suffer unexpected losses. The ACL is our best estimate of expected credit losses; however, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses, particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly and quickly. In such an event, we may increase our ACL, which would reduce our earnings. Additionally, to the extent that economic conditions worsen, impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers or underlying collateral, and credit losses are worse than expected, as may be caused by persistent inflation, an economic recession or otherwise, we may increase our provision for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively impact our financial condition. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate , and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business . A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate located in our core banking markets. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of other financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. Deterioration in national real estate market conditions, or in conditions in specific local real estate markets, could cause us to adjust our opinion of the level of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Such a determination may lead to an additional increase in our ACL, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, changes in the real estate market could also affect the value of foreclosed assets, which could cause additional losses when management determines it is appropriate to sell the assets . We have significant credit exposure in commercial real estate, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our commercial real estate portfolio consists primarily of non-owner-operated properties and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans and depend on cash flows from the owner s business or the property s tenants to service the debt. The borrower s cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the market where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Commercial real estate loans also typically have larger loan balances, and, therefore, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 significant increase in the percentage of our non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement enhanced risk management practices, including stricter underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, more granular reporting, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. If our banking regulators determine that our commercial real estate lending activities are particularly risky and are subject to such heightened scrutiny, we may incur significant additional costs or be required to restrict certain of our commercial real estate lending activities. Our loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Construction and development loans are generally viewed as having more risk than residential real estate loans. Risk of loss on a construction and development loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing and the builder s ability to ultimately sell or rent the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral. Our construction and development loans are primarily secured by real estate, and we believe that, for the majority of these loans, the real estate collateral by itself may not be a sufficient source for repayment of the loan if real estate values decline. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a construction and development loan to satisfy the debt and such collateral is not a sufficient source of repayment, our earnings and capital may be adversely affected. Our commercial and industrial loans have contributed significantly to our loan growth, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We make commercial and industrial loans to support our borrowers need for short-term or seasonal cash flow and equipment/vehicle purchases. These loans are typically based on the borrowers ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself, and, therefore, these loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. In addition, the assets securing these loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and liquidate, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. This type of collateral may not yield substantial recovery in the event a default occurs, and we need to liquidate the business. The loans we make through federal programs are dependent on the federal government s continuation and support of these programs and on our compliance with program requirements. We participate in various U.S. government agency loan guarantee programs, including programs operated by the SBA. If we fail to follow any applicable regulations, guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, these loans may lose the associated guarantee, exposing us to credit risk we would not otherwise be exposed to or have underwritten, or result in our inability to continue originating loans under such programs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Banks that participated as lenders under the PPP continue to be involved in litigation regarding the processes and procedures that such banks used to process loan and forgiveness applications under the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a favorable manner, we may incur significant financial liability or our reputation with current and prospective customers may be harmed. We use independent appraisals and other valuation techniques in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real estate and other real estate owned, which may not accurately describe the net value of the asset. A significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. In considering whether to make a loan secured by real estate, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made and, as real estate values may change significantly in relatively 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately describe the net value of the real estate after the loan is made. Independent appraisers may also make mistakes of fact or judgment that adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our other real estate owned that we acquire through foreclosure proceedings and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our other real estate owned, and our ALLL may not reflect accurate loan impairments. Additionally, if a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, we may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer. We must effectively manage credit risk. There are risks inherent in making any loan and extending loan commitments and letters of credit, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. There is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan underwriting and approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our lenders follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our ACL, each of which could adversely affect our net income. Any failure to manage such credit risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk. We make most of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market share than their competitors, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete, and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which, individually or in the aggregate, may impair their ability as a borrower to repay their loans, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we made some of these loans in recent years, and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Any deterioration of the borrowers businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects our income and increases loan administration costs. When we receive collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases our risk profile and may affect the minimum capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate for us in light of such risks. We use various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers performance or financial condition, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including origination of new loans. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in our nonperforming assets in the future, or that our nonperforming assets will not result in losses in the future.

 Our mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our profits. We originate residential mortgage loans, largely for sale into the secondary mortgage markets, under the Atlantic Union Home Loans Division brand of the Bank, which lends to borrowers nationwide. The success of our mortgage business is dependent on our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors, in each case at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Our loan production levels decreased in 2022 due to rising interest rates, which reduced our income from mortgage activities, and we may suffer further declines if we experience a continued slowdown in our housing market, tightening credit conditions or further increases in interest rates. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure, or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our results of operations. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. When mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the GSEs, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to environmental risks. We own certain of our properties, and a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties, securing certain loans. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected a property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to obtain an environmental study during the underwriting process for certain commercial real estate loan originations and to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Market Interest Rates Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our income and cash flows and may result in higher defaults in a rising rate environment. Our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Since the beginning of 2022, in response to elevated inflation, the FOMC of the Federal Reserve has increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 425 basis points, to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 as of December 31, 2022, and further increased it to the current range of 4.50 to 4.75 in February 2023. As it seeks to control inflation without creating a recession, the FOMC has indicated further increases are to be expected in 2023. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates will likely continue to rise, which is expected to positively impact our net interest income but may negatively impact both the housing market by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases and the U.S. economy. In addition, inflationary pressures will increase our operating costs and could have a significant 
 20

 negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment of loans, the fair value of existing assets and liabilities, the purchase of investments, the retention and generation of deposits, the rates received on loans and investment securities, and the rates paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if we do not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In addition, our ability to reflect such interest rate changes in the pricing our products is influenced by competitive pressures. If the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, we may not be able to reflect increasing interest rates in rates charged on loans or paid on deposits due to competitive pressures, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We generally seek to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that we may reasonably maintain our net interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production, deposit flows, and competitive pressures are constantly changing and influence our ability to maintain a neutral position. Generally, our earnings will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates depending upon the variance in volume of assets and liabilities that mature and re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of changes in interest rates, shape and slope of the yield curve, and whether we are more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, our net interest margin may be adversely affected. We may incur losses if asset values decline, including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including derivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, loans and loan commitments, and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value that are subject to valuation and impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which, for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate. Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. Increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt. In addition, increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may adversely impact the fair value of securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available for sale, may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels. These market moves also may adversely impact the value of debt securities we hold to meet regulatory liquidity requirements. Decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets, and, therefore, may adversely affect net interest income. Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions, and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. We are required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index, which could negatively impact our net income and require significant operational work. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is no longer guaranteed and by June 2023, LIBOR is scheduled to be discontinued. We cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or will provide LIBOR quotations to market participants, or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR or other reference rates may be enacted. The market transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates is a complex process and could have a range of effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including but not limited to by (i) adversely affecting the interest rates received or paid on the revenues and expenses associated with, or the value of our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities; (ii) adversely affecting the interest rates paid on 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 or received from other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR s historically prominent role in determining market interest rates globally, or (iii) resulting in disputes, litigation or other actions with borrowers or other counterparties about the interpretation or enforceability of certain fallback language contained in LIBOR-based loans, securities or other contracts. In addition, uncertainty regarding the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for securities on which the interest or dividend is determined by reference to LIBOR, including our trust preferred securities. The discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in operational, legal and compliance risks, and if we are unable to adequately manage such risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Markets Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial markets , fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions generally. General economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and abroad affect markets in the U.S. and our business. In particular, markets in the U.S. may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, unexpected changes in gross domestic product, economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence. Markets may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks or campaigns, military conflict, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S., as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. Our financial performance generally, and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer and whose success we rely on to drive our growth, is also highly dependent on the business environment in the primary markets where we operate. Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional bank that focuses on providing banking and financial services to customers primarily in Virginia, and in certain markets in Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The economic conditions in these markets may be different from, and in some instances worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. An economic downturn or prolonged recession can result in a deterioration of our credit quality, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, foreclosures, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values and a reduction in deposits and assets under management or administration. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. An economic downturn could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the negative economic conditions and disruptions arising from it have adversely impacted our financial results to varying degrees and in various respects, including as a result of periods of increased ACL. The pandemic s impact on economic conditions and activity remains uncertain and will continue to evolve by region, country and state, and it is possible that new or evolving variants of COVID-19 could result in increased business disruptions and contribute to a potential economic downturn. The U.S. has experienced supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, and the global economy and supply chains remain vulnerable. Pandemic developments and certain responses have also driven higher inflation in the U.S. during 2022 and early 2023 and ultimately may contribute to the development of a prolonged, disruptive period of high inflation in the U.S. and globally, while efforts to combat this inflation could result in an economic recession.

 Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the pandemic and its related consequences on our business, and we could be subject to a number of risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, ability to execute our growth strategy, and ability to pay dividends. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: reductions in our operating effectiveness and increased cybersecurity risk as we continue to have many employees working hybrid schedules that combine working remotely and working in-office; declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products and related reductions in fee income; increased risk of loan delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures due a number of factors, including continuing supply chain issues, inflation, decreased consumer and business confidence and economic activity collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which may reduce our ability to liquidate such collateral and could cause loan losses to increase and impair our ability over the long run to maintain our loan origination volume; unanticipated changes in availability of employees; volatility in financial and capital markets, interest rates, and exchange rates; a prolonged weakness in economic conditions resulting in a reduction of future projected earnings could necessitate a valuation allowance against our current outstanding deferred tax assets; a triggering event leading to impairment testing on our goodwill or core deposit intangibles could result in an impairment charge; disruptions to business operations experienced by counterparties and service providers; and increased demands on capital and liquidity. We may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or access other low-cost funding sources. We rely on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. In addition, our future growth will largely depend on our ability to maintain and grow a strong core deposit base. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, we may not be able to grow our assets as quickly. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits in response to interest rate changes initiated by the FOMC or for other reasons of their choice, our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to retain deposits or because of deposit outflows that require us to rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. Any decline in available funding could adversely affect our ability to continue to implement our business strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations. We face substantial competition that could adversely affect our growth and/or operating results. We operate in a competitive market for financial services and face intense competition from other financial institutions both in making loans and attracting deposits, which can greatly affect pricing for our products and services and could adversely affect our cost of funds. Our primary competitors include community, regional, national and internet banks, as well as credit unions and mortgage companies. Many of these financial institutions are significantly larger and have established customer bases, greater financial resources, and higher lending limits. In addition, credit unions are exempt from corporate income taxes, providing a significant competitive pricing advantage compared to banks. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. In addition, many of these nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks. As a result, some of our competitors have the ability to offer products and services that we are unable to offer or to offer such products and services at more competitive rates. Consumers may increasingly decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that have historically involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds, or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. We face increasing competition from fintech companies, as trends toward digital financial transactions have accelerated following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the higher cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Operations A failure and/or breach of our operating or securities systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in a disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. We depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, we must continue to safeguard and monitor our operational systems and infrastructure for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. Although we have information and data security, business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts. In addition, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. Any failure or interruption in the operation of our communications and information systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our employees and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, terrorist activities, and identity theft, that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our employees and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, terrorist activities or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. We, our customers, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, improper access by employees or service providers, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. Cybersecurity risks have also significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or service providers, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a service provider or by unauthorized service provider access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party service providers with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business. In addition, we, our employees and our customers, are increasingly transitioning 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 our and their computing infrastructure to cloud-based computing, storage, data processing, networking and other services, which may increase these security risks. Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers and/or other third parties, or damage to our or our customers and/or third parties computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional remediation and/or compliance costs, increased insurance premiums and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses related to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our business strategy includes continued growth, and our financial condition and results of operation could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business. Our ability to continue to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including economic conditions in the markets in which we operate as well as in the U.S. and globally, continued availability of desirable business opportunities, and competitive responses from other financial and non-financial institution competitors in our market areas. In addition, our ability to manage growth successfully depends on a variety of factors, including whether we can maintain adequate capital levels, maintain cost controls, effectively manage asset quality, effectively manage increasing regulatory compliance requirements, and successfully integrate any businesses acquired into our organization. While we believe we have the management and other resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed. As consolidation within the financial services industry continues, the competition for growth opportunities, including through strategic acquisition, may increase, and many of our competitors for growth opportunities will have greater financial resources than us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenses to support such growth, any of which could adversely affect our business. Particularly in light of prevailing economic and competitive conditions, we cannot assure you we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition, or results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. We may face risks with respect to future expansion, which could disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value. Our business growth, profitability and market share has been enhanced by us engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions either within or contiguous to our existing footprint. We expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current and expected markets and conduct due diligence related to those opportunities, as well as negotiate to acquire or merge with other institutions. We may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions. We also may issue debt to finance one or more transactions, including subordinated debt issuances, which could cause us to become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, resulting in dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share, as well as dilution to our existing shareholders. 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 Our merger and acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including, among others, the risks of: incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential merger or acquisition targets; our inability to obtain regulatory and other approvals necessary to consummate mergers, acquisitions or other expansion activities, or the risk that such regulatory approvals are delayed, impeded, or conditioned due to existing or new regulatory issues surrounding us, the target institution or the proposed combined entity as a result of, among other things, issues related to anti-money laundering/Bank Secrecy Act compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations, or the Community Reinvestment Act; diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses; potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired or merged company; litigation with respect to the proposed transaction; and the possible loss of our key employees and customers or those of the acquired or merged company. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or that we, after giving effect to the acquisition, will achieve the strategic objectives, operating efficiencies, increased revenues comparable to or better than our historical experience, or other benefits expected in the acquisition, and failure to realize such strategic objectives, operating efficiencies, expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in market presence or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected. When we complete an acquisition, goodwill and other intangible assets are often recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, in aggregate and at a reportable segment level, and we perform this impairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in our expected future cash flows or a sustained adverse change in the price of our common stock, at the reportable segment level and/or the aggregate level, could require our goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. If impaired, we would incur a charge to earnings that would have a significant impact on our results of operations. The carrying value of our goodwill and net amortizable intangibles were approximately 925.2 million and 26.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Our risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses. We maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor, and report the risks that we face. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operational, reputation, compliance, legal, technology, and model risk. While we assess and seek to improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management framework and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk-management program, or if our controls break down, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and become subject to litigation, negative regulatory consequences, or reputational damage among other adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business and ability to remain competitive. The financial services industry is continually undergoing technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, and we anticipate that new technologies will continue to emerge. Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. Developing or acquiring access to new technologies and incorporating those technologies into our products and services, or using them to expand our products and services, may require significant investments, may take considerable time to complete, and ultimately may not be successful. If we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate customer expectations, substantially fewer resources to invest in technological improvements than our larger competitors, or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, we may lose market share or incur additional expense .

 Our business could be adversely affected by the operational functions of business counterparties over which we have limited or no control. Multiple major U.S. retailers and a major consumer credit reporting agency have experienced data systems incursions in recent years reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other personal and financial data of hundreds of millions of individuals. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including us. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these incursions can still cause customers to be dissatisfied with us and otherwise adversely affect our reputation. These events can also cause us to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft or loss to us and our customers. In some cases, we may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Credit reporting agency intrusions affect our customers and can require these customers and us to increase account monitoring and take remedial action to prevent unauthorized account activity or access. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server cloud service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Third parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, core processing, internet connections, and network access. Any disruption in the services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial, technological or operational difficulties of a third-party service provider could also negatively impact our operations if those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. In addition, one or more of our third-party service providers may become subject to cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss of destruction of our or our client s confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients or other third parties business operations. While we have processes in place to monitor our third-party service providers data and information security safeguards, we do not control such service providers day-to-day operations and a successful attack or security breach at one or more of such third-party service providers is not within our control. The occurrence of any such breaches, disruption in services provided by such third parties or other failures could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures, third-party breaches, or other disruptions. Replacing these third-party service providers could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and our financial condition could be adversely affected if we rely on misleading information. In deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which we do not independently verify. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer s audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the borrower. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of borrowers due to our reliance on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading. We are subject to losses due to errors, omissions or fraudulent behavior by our employees, clients, counterparties or other third parties. We are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by third parties, customers and employees, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. While our procedures are designed to follow customary, industry-

 specific security precautions and while we provide employees with ongoing training and regular communications and guidance to combat fraud, our efforts might not be successful in mitigating or reducing fraudulent attempts resulting in financial losses, increased litigation risk and reputational harm. Our business also depends on our employees, as well as third-party service providers, to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially and adversely affected if employees, clients, counterparties or other third parties caused an operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error, fraudulent manipulation or purposeful damage to any of our operations or systems. Competition for talent is substantial. If we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate our human capital, our business, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. We are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization, and our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our management team and other key employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially and adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts that they have undertaken and to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. The loss of personnel with extensive customer relationships may also lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. Our ability to attract and retain employees could also be impacted by changing workforce concerns, expectations, practices and preferences, including remote work and hybrid work preferences brought on by the pandemic, and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or developing, retaining and motivating our employees, our business, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. Our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Maintaining and adapting our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and effective corporate governance policies and procedures controls and procedures is expensive and requires significant management attention. Moreover, as we continue to grow, our controls and procedures may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance. Failure to implement effective controls and procedures or circumvention of our controls and procedures could, among other things, cause us to fail to meet our public reporting obligations, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and the trading price of our securities. Our business needs and future growth may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly, or if we develop an asset concentration that requires the support of additional capital. Our ability to raise capital, if needed, in the future to meet capital needs or otherwise will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, our current shareholders interests could be diluted. We are or may become party from time to time to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties such that the expenses and ultimate exposure with respect to many of these matters cannot be ascertained. From time to time, we, our directors and our management are, or may become, the subject of various claims and legal actions by customers, employees, shareholders and others. Whether such claims and legal actions are legitimate or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect our reputation and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those

 products and services. In light of the potential cost and uncertainty involved in litigation, we have in the past and may in the future settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense. Certain claims may seek injunctive relief, which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our cost of doing business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms. Any judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future claims, litigation or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. We are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings, and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way we conduct our business, or reputational harm. We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax assets. We have net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that relate to our deferred tax assets. Our management currently believes that it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets, based on management s expectation that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to absorb substantially all of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, we may not be able to fully realize our deferred tax assets and would be required to record a valuation allowance against these assets. A valuation allowance would be recorded as income tax expense and would adversely affect our net income. Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the FDIC, and the Virginia SCC. In addition, because we exceed 10 billion in total assets, we are subject to additional regulatory requirements compared to financial institutions with less than 10 billion in total assets, including, among other things, potentially higher FDIC assessment rates, a cap on the interchange fees that we can charge on debit card transactions and enhanced supervision as a larger financial institution. This regulation is imposed primarily to protect depositors, the FDIC DIF, consumers, and the banking system as a whole. We also are regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which regulation is designed to protect investors. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and potentially restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid and deposits and locations of our offices. We are also subject to capital guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain sufficient capital to support our growth. Regulation of the financial services industry has increased significantly since the global financial crisis. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform as well as any effect on our business and financial results, are uncertain. Additionally, legislation or regulation may impose unexpected or unintended consequences, the impact of which is difficult to predict. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Current and to-be-effective laws and regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs and failure to comply with such laws and regulation could impact our business, financial condition, and reputation. We are subject to a number of laws concerning consumer privacy and data use and security, including information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These rules require that financial institutions develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities, and the sensitivity 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 of any customer information at issue. The United States has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach. In addition, most states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of certain types of security breaches, and certain states including Virginia have enacted significant new consumer data privacy protections that can significantly limit a company s use of customer financial data and impose significant compliance burdens on companies that collect or use that data. The new Virginia consumer data privacy laws became effective in 2023, and compliance with these laws may require significant expenditures of time and resources. Additional new regulations in these areas may increase compliance costs, which could negatively impact our earnings. In addition, failure to comply with these privacy and data use and security laws and regulations, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties, or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and reputation. We are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected. The Company and the Bank each must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Banking organizations experiencing growth, especially those making acquisitions, are expected to hold additional capital above regulatory minimums. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. In addition, regulators may require us to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital based on our condition, risk profile, or growth plans or conditions in the banking industry or economy. In recent years, these market and regulatory expectations have increased substantially and have resulted in higher and more stringent capital requirements for the Company and the Bank. The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require us to raise additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were unable to comply with such requirements. Our failure to remain well capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Under regulatory rules, if the Bank ceases to be a well capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that it pays and its ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted. We are subject to the CFPB s broad regulatory and enforcement authority and new regulations, and new approaches to regulation or enforcement by the CFPB could adversely impact us. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over us and has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial protection laws. Among other things, the CFPB is authorized to issue rules identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has broad discretion to interpret the term abusive to cover a wide range of acts or practices. New regulations, or new approaches to regulation or enforcement by the CFPB could adversely impact our deposit, consumer lending, mortgage lending, loan collection or overdraft coverage programs and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, and any deemed deficiency by the Bank with respect to these laws could result in significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business strategy. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. The Bank is also required to comply with the rules enforced by OFAC regarding, among other things, the prohibition of transacting business with, and the need to freeze assets of, certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. Bank regulatory agencies routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these statutes and related regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and 
 31

 regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, or could cause a bank regulatory agency not to approve a merger or acquisition transaction or to prohibit such a transaction even if formal approval is not required. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. In addition, such a failure could result in a regulatory authority imposing a formal enforcement action or civil money penalty for regulatory violations. We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a material penalties and other sanctions. The CRA, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. The Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank. Applicable law and the Federal Reserve require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress. A capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Risks Related to Our Securities Our ability to pay dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay dividends in the future. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. In addition, the Company is a financial holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank and other subsidiaries. As a result, the Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries, particularly the Bank, for substantially all of its revenues. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on its dividends that are applicable to state member banks that are regulated by the Federal Reserve and the Virginia SCC. For information on these regulatory restrictions on the right of the Bank to pay dividends to us and on the right of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders, see Part I Item 1 Supervision and Regulation Limits on Dividend and Other Payments. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, or if the Bank does not have sufficient earnings to make payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock or depositary shares, which represent a fractional interest in the Company s Series A preferred stock, and may be unable to service debt or pay obligations, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially adversely affected. Any declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock, including our depositary shares, and other factors deemed relevant by the board 
 32

 of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our business plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our shareholders. Although we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made by our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. The trading volumes in our common stock may not provide adequate liquidity for investors. Shares of our common stock are listed on the NYSE; however, the average trading volume is less than that of other larger financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given these factors, a shareholder may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock at an attractive price (or at all). Additionally, shareholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of our common stock shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. Given the current daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a significant decline in the price of our common stock. Future capital needs could result in dilution of shareholder investment and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock (or depositary shares representing a fractional interest in our preferred stock) . We are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock up to the number of shares authorized in our articles of incorporation. We may issue additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock (or depositary shares representing a fractional interest in our preferred stock), or securities convertible into common stock, in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including mergers and acquisitions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to address regulatory capital concerns, or to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding stock awards. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, preferred stock (or depositary shares representing a fractional interest in our preferred stock) or securities convertible into common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock, preferred stock (or depositary shares representing a fractional interest in our preferred stock) and could have a material negative effect on the market price of such securities and could be dilutive to shareholders. Holders of our indebtedness and of depositary shares related to our Series A preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding subordinated notes, trust preferred securities and accompanying subordinated debentures and preferred stock totaling 390.0 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the subordinated notes and the subordinated debentures accompanying the trust preferred securities and dividends on the preferred stock are senior to payments with respect to shares of our common stock. We also conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities. As a result, we must make payments on these debt instruments (including the related trust preferred securities) and preferred shares before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debt and preferred shares must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities (and the related guarantee of payments on the trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock. If our financial condition deteriorates or if we do not receive required regulatory approvals, we may be required to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities (and the related guarantee of payments on the trust preferred securities). We may from time to time issue additional senior or subordinated indebtedness or preferred stock that would have to be repaid before our shareholders would be entitled to receive any of our assets. Our governing documents and the provisions of Virginia law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover affect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of the Company that you may favor. 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 Our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to respond to attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences, and other terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, even though you may favor such transactions, and could potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our stock price may be volatile , which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us . Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock or depositary shares when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which are unrelated to our financial performance, including, among other things: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations; changes in our coverage by securities analysts and/or changes in their estimates of our financial performance or recommendations; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors; new technology used, or services offered, by competitors; significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; changes in government regulations; or geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts, the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics and trade relations. General market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the local economy; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our normal business. General Risk Factors The implementation of new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk. We continuously evaluate our service offerings and, from time to time, may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, strategic planning remains important as we adopt innovative products, services, and processes in response to the evolving demands for financial services and the entrance of new competitors, such as out-of-market banks and fintech companies. Any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls, so we must responsibly innovate in a manner that is consistent with sound risk management and is aligned with our overall business strategies. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

 Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. Our reputation is critical to the success of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. We do this, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve; delivering superior service to our customers; and caring about our customers and employees. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers in our ability to provide financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and business partners, and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our core values and controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, record-keeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action as we seek to implement our growth strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings. The authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the FASB, SEC, and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively to financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also require us to incur additional personnel or technology costs. We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather and natural disaster impacts. We are subject to the growing risk of climate change. Among the risks associated with climate change are more frequent severe weather events. Severe weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornados, winter storms, freezes, flooding and other large-scale weather catastrophes in our markets subject us to significant risks and more frequent severe weather events magnify those risks. Large-scale weather catastrophes or other significant climate change effects that either damage or destroy residential or multifamily real estate underlying mortgage loans or real estate collateral, could decrease the value of our real estate collateral or increase our delinquency rates in the affected areas and thus diminish the value of our loan portfolio. In addition, the effects of climate change may have a significant effect on our geographic markets, and could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, third party service providers, or supply chains more generally. Those disruptions could result in declines in economic conditions in our geographic markets or industries in which our borrowers operate and impact their ability to repay loans or maintain deposits. Climate change could also impact our assets or employees directly or lead to changes in customer preferences that could negatively affect our growth or business strategies. In addition, our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged due to our practices related to climate change, including our or our customers involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change. We are subject to ESG risks that could adversely affect our reputation, the trading price of our common stock and/or our business, operations, and earnings. Governments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures. For us and others in the financial services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. In addition, certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based on ESG metrics. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of ESG evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, and if we were to fail to maintain appropriate ESG practices and disclosures or be subject to a low ESG score or rating, we could face potential negative ESG-related publicity in traditional and social media, including based on the identity of those we choose to do business with and the public s 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 view of those customers. If we or our relationships with customers, service providers and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity or low ESG scores or ratings, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively impacted and our stock price may also be adversely impacted. Additionally, new government regulations could result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanded mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure. ESG-related costs, including with respect to compliance with any additional regulatory or disclosure requirements or expectations, could adversely impact our results of operations. Investors also have begun to consider how corporations are addressing ESG matters when making investment decisions. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to climate change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. Any such negative publicity regarding ESG, low ESG scores or ratings, or shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock and/or our business, operations and earnings if investors, shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed ESG matters. ITEM 1B. - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. We have no unresolved staff comments to report. ITEM 2. - PROPERTIES. The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns or leases buildings that are used in the normal course of business. The Company leases its corporate headquarters, located at 1051 East Cary Street, Suite 1200, Richmond, Virginia. Our subsidiaries also own or lease various other offices in the counties and cities in which they operate. At December 31, 2022, the Bank operated 114 branches throughout Virginia and in portions of Maryland and North Carolina. Our properties and branches are used by both the Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking reportable operating segments. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 4 Premises and Equipment , Note 6 Leases , and Note 17 Segment Reporting and Revenue in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information with respect to the amounts at which the Company s premises and equipment are carried and commitments under long-term leases. ITEM 3. - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings. Based on the information presently available and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the business or the financial condition or results of operations of the Company subject to the potential outcomes of the matter discussed below. As previously disclosed, on February 9, 2022, pursuant to the CFPB s Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise process, the CFPB Office of Enforcement notified the Bank that it is considering recommending that the CFPB take legal action against the Bank in connection with alleged violations of Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 1005.17, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5531 and 5536, in connection with the Bank s overdraft practices and policies. The purpose of the CFPB s notice process is to ensure that potential subjects of enforcement actions have the opportunity to respond to alleged violations and present their positions to the CFPB before an enforcement action is recommended or commenced. Should the CFPB commence a legal action, it may seek restitution to affected customers, civil monetary penalties, injunctive relief, or other corrective action. The Company and the Bank are unable at this time to determine how or when the matter will be resolved or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. ITEM 4. - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. None.

 PART II ITEM 5. - MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. Information on Common Stock, Market Prices and Dividends On January 18, 2023, we voluntarily completed the transfer of the listing of our common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to the NYSE, where our common stock continues to trade under the symbol AUB . There were 74,712,622 shares of our common stock outstanding held by 6,167 shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2022. During 2022, we declared two quarterly dividends per share of our common stock of 0.28 for the first two quarters of 2022 and two quarterly dividends of 0.30 for the second two quarters of 2022 for an annual total of 1.16 per share. Although we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, any future dividend determinations will be made by our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including (1) our historic and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, (2) our capital levels and needs, (3) tax considerations, (4) any acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may examine, (5) statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations, (6) the terms of contractual arrangements that restrict our ability to pay cash dividends, (7) general economic conditions, and (8) other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock and are subject to restrictions on paying dividends on our common stock. Because we are a financial holding company and do not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends, in large part, upon our receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal banking laws, regulations and policies. See Supervision and Regulation The Company Limits on Dividends, Capital Distributions and Other Payments. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company at December 31, 2022 are set forth in Note 19 Parent Company Financial Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Stock Repurchase Programs On December 10, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to 100.0 million of our common stock through December 9, 2022 in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and /or Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The repurchase program permitted management to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time at management s discretion. The repurchase program did not obligate us to purchase any particular number of shares. As part of the repurchase program, approximately 1.3 million shares (or approximately 48.2 million) were repurchased throughout 2022. There were no share repurchase transactions under the repurchase program in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The following information provides details of our common stock repurchases for the three months ended December 31, 2022:

 Five-Year Stock Performance Graph The following stock performance graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative shareholder return on our common stock during the five years ended December 31, 2022, with (1) the Total Return Index for the NASDAQ Composite, (2) the Total Return Index for the NYSE Composite, and (3) the Total Return Index for KBW NASDAQ Regional Banking. This comparison assumes 100 was invested on December 31, 2017 in our common stock and the comparison groups and assumes the reinvestment of all cash dividends prior to any tax effect and retention of all stock dividends. In 2022, because our common stock was traded on NASDAQ, we used the NASDAQ composite index as our broad equity market index. As discussed above, we voluntarily transferred the listing of our common stock to the NYSE on January 18, 2023. As a result, we have changed our broad equity market index for purposes of disclosure in the stock performance graph to the NYSE composite index and have included returns in the stock performance graph based on both of these indices. In future periods we will no longer reference the NASDAQ composite index in comparing total shareholder returns on our common stock. We did not change our line-of-business index, which is the KBW NASDAQ Regional Banking index, as a result of our transfer to the NYSE.

 ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the Company s significant accounting policies, presented in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in this Form 10-K. Amounts are rounded for presentation purposes; however, some of the percentages presented are computed based on unrounded amounts. In management s discussion and analysis, the Company provides certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are a supplement to GAAP, which is used to prepare the Company s financial statements, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in its analysis of the Company s performance. The Company s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in the Company s underlying performance. Non-GAAP financial measures may be identified with the symbol (+) and may be labeled as adjusted. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section within this Item 7 for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting and reporting policies in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies, which require the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, estimates, assumptions or judgements could result in material changes in the Company s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. The Company has identified the allowance for loan and lease losses and fair value measurements as accounting policies that require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Therefore, the Company evaluates these accounting policies and related critical accounting estimates on an ongoing basis and updates them as needed. Management has discussed these accounting policies and critical accounting estimates summarized below with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses - The ALLL represents the estimated balance that management considers adequate to absorb expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loan portfolio. We estimate the ALLL using a loan-level probability of default, loss given default method for all loans with the exception of our overdraft, auto, and third-party consumer lending portfolios. For auto and third-party consumer lending portfolios, the Company has elected to pool those loans based on similar risk characteristics to determine the ALLL using vintage and loss rate methods. Determining the appropriateness of the ALLL is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the ALLL in future periods. There are both internal factors (i.e. loan balances, credit quality, and the contractual lives of loans) and external factors (i.e. economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, unemployment, and energy prices that can impact the ALLL estimate. 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 For instance, the Company considers a number of external economic variables in developing the ALLL, the most significant of which is the Virginia unemployment rate. The quantitative ALLL estimate is sensitive to changes in the Virginia unemployment rate forecast over a two-year reasonable and supportable period, with the commercial loan portfolio being the most sensitive to fluctuations in unemployment. To forecast Virginia unemployment, the Company uses Moody s economic forecasts. At December 31, 2022, the baseline scenario used in this two-year forecast had Virginia s unemployment rate at an average of 3.1 , compared to an average of 2.6 at December 31, 2021. Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the ALLL, could change significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall ALLL because the Company uses a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the ALLL and changes in those factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all loan types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. The Company reviews its ALLL estimation process regularly for appropriateness as the economic and internal environment are constantly changing. While the ALLL estimate represents management s current estimate of expected credit losses, due to uncertainty surrounding internal and external factors, there is potential that the estimate may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio. While management uses available information to estimate expected losses on loans, future changes in the ALLL may be necessary based on changes in portfolio composition, portfolio credit quality, economic conditions and/or other factors. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in this Form 10-K for more information on the Company s ALLL. Fair Value Measurements - Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including securities and derivative instruments. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions, adjustments, and judgment including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, cash flows, default rates, loss rates, terminal values and liquidation values. A significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value, which in turn, may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. Under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , there is a three-level fair value hierarchy that requires the use of inputs that are observable or unobservable, when observable inputs are not available. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. As such, fair value measurements, particularly in level 2 and level 3 of the hierarchy, may require us to use significant assumptions that are subject to change. A change in one assumption could have a significant impact on the fair value estimate and certain assumptions may have offsetting impacts to one another. Management prepares a supportable estimate in accordance with ASC 820 but changes in significant assumptions could have a significant impact on the Company s Balance Sheet, Statement of Income, and/or fair value disclosures. For more information of the Company s financial instruments and fair value assessment, refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13 Fair Value Measurements in this Form 10-K.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (ISSUED BUT NOT FULLY ADOPTED) In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging- Portfolio Layer Method to allow nonprepayable financial assets to be included in a closed portfolio hedge using the portfolio layer method and to allow multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed portfolio of financial assets or one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of financial instruments. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company evaluated the impact of ASU No. 2022-01 and concluded that it will not have material implications on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02 Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This guidance eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, for public business entities, the amendments require disclosure of current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Measured at Amortized Cost . The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 and concluded it will not have material implications on its consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES Recent Events The Company is continually monitoring the impact of various global and national events on the Company s results of operations and financial condition, including inflation and rising interest rates, the ongoing impact of COVID-19, and geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine). Inflation has risen as a result of growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, as well as labor shortages and supply chain issues. As a result, market interest rates began to rise during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows. On March 16, 2022, the FOMC began to increase its Federal Funds target rates to a range of 0.25 to 0.50 , which was the first increase since December 2018. The FOMC further increased the target rates throughout 2022 and early 2023 to its current range of 4.50 to 4.75 . The FOMC also foreshadowed potential further increases to the target rates throughout 2023 and also confirmed the continued reduction to the Federal Reserve s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. These actions have impacted the Company s asset-sensitive position throughout 2022 and resulted in an expansion of net interest margin, as well as an increase in unrealized losses in AFS securities, and a decline in purchases of mortgages. The timing and impact of inflation and rising interest rates on the Company s interest rate sensitivity, businesses, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The Company will continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to seek to manage the Company s risk related to interest rate fluctuations. Refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K for additional information about the Company s interest rate sensitivity.

 Strategic Initiatives T he Company has been taking certain actions to reduce expenses in light of the current and expected operating environment, which included the closure of the Company s operations center and the consolidation of certain branches. These closures and consolidations totaled 16 branches for the year ended December 31, 2022, five branches for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 15 branches for the year ended December 31, 2020. These actions resulted in restructuring expenses primarily related to real estate, lease and other asset write downs, and severance costs of 5.5 million, 17.4 million, and 6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Effective June 30, 2022, the Company transferred its ownership interest in DHFB, which was formerly a subsidiary of the Bank, to Cary Street Partners Financial LLC in exchange for a minority ownership interest in Cary Street Partners Financial LLC, resulting in a 9.1 million pre-tax gain for the year ended December 31, 2022. During 2021, the Company sold shares of Visa, Inc. Class B common stock and recorded a pre-tax gain in other income of 5.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2021. Share Repurchase Program On December 10, 2021, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to 100.0 million of the Company s common stock through December 9, 2022 in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The Company repurchased an aggregate of approximately 1.3 million shares (or approximately 48.2 million) through this repurchase program. At December 31, 2022, there were no active share repurchase programs, as the prior repurchase programs have expired or been fully utilized. SUMMARY OF 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS Executive Overview Net Income Performance Metrics Net income available to common shareholders was 222.6 million and diluted EPS was 2.97 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of 252.0 million and diluted EPS of 3.26 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders (+) , which excludes, as applicable, dividends on preferred stock, net losses related to balance sheet repositioning (principally composed of losses on debt extinguishment), gains or losses on sale of securities, gain on the sale of DHFB, gain on Visa, Inc. Class B common stock, as well as strategic branch closing and related facility consolidation costs, totaled 219.0 million and diluted adjusted operating EPS (+) was 2.92 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders (+) of 273.3 million and diluted adjusted operating EPS (+) of 3.53 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents were 319.9 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 482.6 million or 60.1 from December 31, 2021. Total investments were 3.7 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 476.7 million or 11.4 from December 31, 2021. LHFI (net of deferred fees and costs) were 14.4 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of 1.3 billion or 9.5 from December 31, 2021 . Excluding PPP loans (+) , LHFI (net of deferred fees and costs) totaled 14.4 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of 1.4 billion or 10.7 from the prior year. Total deposits at December 31, 2022 were 15.9 billion, a decrease of 679.4 million or 4.1 from December 31, 2021.

 Net Income 2022 compared to 2021 Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 222.6 million, a decrease of 29.4 million or 11.7 and represented diluted EPS of 2.97, compared to 252.0 million and 3.26, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a 79.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses to 19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a negative provision of 60.9 million for the prior year, reflecting the impact of a higher ACL due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast and loan growth, and a 7.3 million decrease in noninterest income. These changes were partially offset by a 33.0 million increase in net interest income, a 15.4 million decrease in noninterest expenses, and a 9.4 million decrease in income tax expense. Adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders (+) totaled 219.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 273.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and diluted adjusted operating EPS (+) was 2.92 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.53 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 584.3 million, an increase of 33.0 million or 6.0 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in overall earning asset yields of 39 bps for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by the impact of rising market interest rates on loans and taxable investment securities yields, and growth in average loans and average investment securities. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cost of funds of 19 bps for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by higher deposit and borrowing costs. Noninterest income decreased 7.3 million or 5.8 to 118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 125.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking income as mortgage loan origination volumes and gain on sale margins declined, and fiduciary and asset management fees as assets under management decreased due to the sale of DHFB. Partially offsetting these decreases in noninterest income were increases in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to higher transaction volumes, and other operating income primarily driven by the gain on sale of DHFB, and an increase in loan syndication, SBA 7a, and foreign exchange revenues, partially offset by a decline in equity method investment income and the impact of the gain in 2021 on the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B common stock. Noninterest expense decreased 15.4 million or 3.7 to 403.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 419.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in loss on debt extinguishment and in other expenses, primarily driven by a decrease in branch closing and facility consolidation costs and a gain related to the sale and leaseback of an office building, as well as decreases in amortization of intangible assets, occupancy expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, professional services, and marketing and advertising expense. These decreases in noninterest expense were partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits, technology and data processing, and FDIC assessment premiums and other insurance. 2021 compared to 2020 Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 99.5 million or 65.2 to 252.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and represented diluted EPS of 3.26, compared to 152.6 million and 1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the decrease in the provision for credit losses, by 148.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2020 to a negative 60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases to the Company s ACL estimates driven by ongoing economic improvements, benign credit quality metrics since the COVID-19 pandemic began and a positive macroeconomic outlook. This increase was partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher noninterest expenses, and lower net interest income and noninterest income. Adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders (+) totaled 273.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 174.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and diluted adjusted operating EPS (+) were 3.53 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2.21 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled 551.3 million, which was a decrease of 4.0 million or 0.7 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of a decline in overall earning asset yields of 52 bps

Table of Contents 
 for the year ended December 31, 2021, offset by a decline in cost of funds of 35 bps for the year ended December 31, 2021 and increased loan accretion recognized on PPP loans. Noninterest income decreased 5.7 million or 4.3 from 131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 125.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as declines in gains on securities transactions, loan swap fees reflecting lower transaction volumes in the current year, and mortgage banking income reflecting lower mortgage loan origination volumes in the current year, were partially offset by increases in unrealized gains on equity method investments, the gain on sale of Visa, Inc. Class B common stock, fiduciary and asset management fees primarily reflecting higher assets under management, income on bank owned life insurance, interchange fees, service charges on deposits, and also the impact of prior year benefitting from a balance sheet repositioning gain. Noninterest expense increased 5.8 million or 1.4 from 413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 419.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in branch closing and facility consolidation costs, as well as the impact of higher salaries and benefit costs, professional services costs, and technology and data processing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by declines in losses related to balance sheet repositioning, core deposit intangibles amortization costs, loan-related expenses, and other business continuity expenses associated with the Company s response to COVID-19. Net Interest Income Net interest income, which represents the principal source of revenue for the Company, is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income, the net interest margin, and net income. The following tables show interest income on earning assets and related average yields, as well as interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and related average rates paid for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Average interest-earning assets 17,853,216 17,903,671 (50,455) Interest and dividend income 660,435 592,359 68,076 Interest and dividend income (FTE) (+) 675,308 604,950 70,358 Yield on interest-earning assets 3.70 3.31 39 bps Yield on interest-earning assets (FTE) (+) 3.78 3.38 40 bps Average interest-bearing liabilities 11,873,030 11,938,582 (65,552) Interest expense 76,174 41,099 35,075 Cost of interest-bearing liabilities 0.64 0.34 30 bps Cost of funds 0.42 0.23 19 bps Net interest income 584,261 551,260 33,001 Net interest income (FTE) (+) 599,134 563,851 35,283 Net interest margin 3.27 3.08 19 bps Net interest margin (FTE) (+) 3.36 3.15 21 bps For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income was 584.3 million, an increase of 33.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income (FTE) (+) was 599.1 million, an increase of 35.3 million from the prior year. The increases in net interest income and net interest income (FTE) (+) were primarily driven by higher loan yields on the Company s variable rate loans due to rising market interest rates and loan growth and increases in investment income primarily due to higher yields on taxable securities driven by rising market interest rates and growth in the average balance of the investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to increased deposit and borrowing costs as a result of higher short-term interest rates and additional borrowings related to the 2031 Notes and increased FHLB advances. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest margin increased 19 bps and net interest margin (FTE) (+) increased 21 bps, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands).

The decreases in both net interest income and net interest income (FTE) (+) were primarily the result of a decline in overall loan and securities yields partially offset by a decline in cost of funds and increased loan accretion recognized on PPP loans. For the year ended December 31, 2021, PPP loan accretion totaled 39.3 million, an increase of 6.8 million from 32.5 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net interest margin decreased 18 bps and net interest margin (FTE) (+) decreased 17 bps, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The net decline in net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE) (+) measures were primarily driven by a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in cost of funds and an increase in loan accretion on PPP loans. The decline in the Company s earning asset yields was primarily driven by declines in loan and securities yields, as a result of the decrease in market interest rates. The cost of funds decline was driven by lower deposit costs and wholesale borrowing costs driven by lower market interest rates and a favorable funding mix.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, noninterest income decreased 7.3 million or 5.8 to 118.5 million from 125.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding, as applicable, the gain on sale of DHFB 9.1 million in 2022 compared to 0 in 2021), the gain on sale of Visa, Inc. Class B common stock 0 in 2022 compared to 5.1 million in 2021), and gains and losses on sale of securities (losses of 3,000 in 2022 compared to gains of 87,000 in 2021), adjusted operating noninterest income (+) for the year ended December 31, 2022 declined by 11.1 million or 9.2 from the prior year, which was driven primarily by a 13.9 million decrease in mortgage banking income as mortgage loan origination volumes and gain on sale margins each declined due to the rapid rise in market interest rates in 2022, a 5.1 million decrease in fiduciary and asset management fees as assets under management decreased due to the sale of DHFB, and a 2.6 million decrease in other operating income primarily driven by a decline in equity method investment income, partially offset by an increase in loan syndication, SBA 7a, foreign exchange revenues and by a 6.6 million increase in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to higher transaction volumes. 

For the Year Ended December 31, Change 2021 2020 (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest income: Service charges on deposit accounts 27,122 25,251 1,871 7.4 Other service charges, commissions and fees 6,595 6,292 303 4.8 Interchange fees 8,279 7,184 1,095 15.2 Fiduciary and asset management fees 27,562 23,650 3,912 16.5 Mortgage banking income 21,022 25,857 (4,835) (18.7) Bank owned life insurance income 11,488 9,554 1,934 20.2 Loan-related interest rate swap fees 5,620 15,306 (9,686) (63.3) Other operating income (1) 18,118 18,392 (274) (1.5) Total noninterest income 125,806 131,486 (5,680) (4.3)

 For the year ended December 31, 2021, noninterest income decreased 5.7 million or 4.3 to 125.8 million from 131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the gain from the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B common stock 5.1 million in 2021 compared to 0 in 2020), gains on securities transactions 87,000 in 2021 compared to 12.3 million in 2020), and losses related to balance sheet repositioning 0 in 2021 compared to gains of 1.8 million in 2020), adjusted operating noninterest income (+) for the year ended December 31, 2021 declined by 379,000 or 0.31 from the prior year. The slight net decrease in adjusted operating noninterest income (+) from the prior year was driven by a decline of 9.7 million in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to lower transaction volumes and a decline of 4.8 million in mortgage banking income due to lower mortgage origination volumes; largely offset by increases of 5.8 million in unrealized gains on equity method investments, an increase of 3.9 million in fiduciary and asset management fees due to market driven increases in assets under management, higher BOLI of 1.9 million primarily due to life insurance proceeds received in 2021, increases of 1.9 million in service charges on deposit accounts, and 1.1 million in interchange fees due to higher transaction volumes.

Excluding amortization of intangible assets 10.8 million in 2022 compared to 13.9 million in 2021), losses related to balance sheet repositioning 0 in 2022 compared to 14.7 million in 2021), and branch closing and facility consolidation costs 5.5 million in 2022 compared to 17.4 million in 2021), adjusted operating noninterest expense (+) for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 14.3 million or 3.8 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, due to a 14.0 million increase in salaries and benefits primarily driven by higher salaries, wages, and variable incentive compensation, a 3.2 million increase in technology and data processing expenses, which includes the write-down of obsolete software, a 2.1 million increase in other expenses, primarily driven by increases in teammate travel and training costs and non-credit related losses on customer transactions, partially offset by a gain related to the sale and leaseback of an office building, and a 759,000 increase in FDIC assessment premiums and other insurance. The increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a 2.7 million decrease in occupancy expenses and a 1.1 million decrease in furniture and equipment expenses, partially reflecting the impact of the Company s consolidation of 16 branches that was completed in March 2022, a 1.1 million decrease in professional services expenses due to a decrease in legal and consulting fees associated with various strategic initiatives, and a 639,000 decrease in marketing and advertising expense.

Excluding amortization of intangible assets 13.9 million in 2021 compared to 16.6 million in 2020), losses related to balance sheet repositioning 14.7 million in 2021 compared to 31.1 million in 2020), and branch closing and facility consolidation costs 17.4 million in 2021 compared to 6.8 million in 2020), adjusted operating noninterest expense (+) for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 14.3 million or 4.0 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to an increase of 8.3 million in salaries and benefits primarily driven by higher salaries, wages, and contract labor costs, 4.8 million in professional services costs due to an increase in legal and consulting fees associated with various strategic initiatives, 4.3 million in technology and data processing expenses primarily driven by higher software licensing and maintenance expenses, and contract termination costs of approximately 900,000. The increases were partially offset by a decline in loan-related expenses of approximately 2.5 million driven by lower third-party loan servicing costs compared to the prior year. Segment Results As discussed in Note 17 Segment Reporting and Revenue in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K, effective as of the third quarter of 2022, the Company began segmenting its business into two primary reportable operating segments Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking as these segments reflect how the chief operating decision makers are now evaluating the business, establishing the overall business strategy, allocating resources, and assessing business performance. Included below are the key metrics used by the chief operating decision makers in evaluating the Company s reportable operating segments. The Company restated its segment information for the year ended December 31, 2021 under the new basis with two reportable operating segments; however, the Company determined that it is impracticable to restate segment information for the year ended December 31, 2020. Therefore, no such disclosures are presented for 2020, when the Company s only reportable operating segment was the Bank.

 Wholesale Banking The Wholesale Banking segment provides loan and deposit services, as well as treasury management and capital market services to wholesale customers primarily throughout Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These customers include commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. This segment also includes the Company s public finance subsidiary and the equipment finance subsidiary, which has nationwide exposure. The following table presents operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Wholesale Banking segment (dollars in thousands): 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net interest income 296,040 297,950 Provision for credit losses 11,517 (34,225) Net interest income after provision for credit losses 284,523 332,175 Noninterest income 24,094 14,002 Noninterest expense 143,065 130,220 Income before income taxes 165,552 215,957 Wholesale Banking income before income taxes decreased 50.4 million to 165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses of 45.7 million due to changes in the macroeconomic outlook and loan growth in 2022. In addition, noninterest expense increased by 12.8 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages, travel and entertainment, and non-credit related losses on customer transactions. These increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense were partially offset by an increase in noninterest income of 10.1 million primarily due to increases in loan swap fees due to higher transaction volumes and increases in loan syndication fees. In addition, net interest income decreased 1.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in PPP related income of 20.4 million, partially offset by increased interest income primarily driven by higher loan balances. The following table presents the key balance sheet metrics as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Wholesale Banking segment (dollars in thousands): 

December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs 11,339,660 10,242,918 Total Deposits 5,870,061 6,114,078

Table of Contents 
 LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs, for the Wholesale Banking segment increased 1.1 billion or 10.7 to 11.3 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021; growth occurred in the construction and land development, commercial real estate non-owner occupied, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. Wholesale Banking deposits decreased 244.0 million or 4.0 to 5.9 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in demand deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing transaction deposits, which was primarily due to the impact of customer behavior in response to inflation and higher market interest rates. Consumer Banking The Consumer Banking segment provides loan and deposit services to consumers and small businesses throughout Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Consumer Banking includes the home loan division and the wealth management division, which consists of private banking, trust, and investment management and advisory services. The following table presents operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Consumer Banking segment (dollars in thousands): 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net interest income 228,550 225,630 Provision for credit losses 7,472 (26,663) Net interest income after provision for credit losses 221,078 252,293 Noninterest income 69,362 85,008 Noninterest expense 238,117 237,590 Income before income taxes 52,323 99,711 Consumer Banking income before income taxes decreased 47.4 million to 52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses of 34.1 million due to changes in the macroeconomic outlook and loan growth in 2022. In addition, noninterest income decreased by 15.6 million, primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage banking income due to a decline in mortgage origination volumes, and a decrease in fiduciary and asset management fees primarily due to the sale of DHFB. Net interest income increased 2.9 million from 2021 primarily due to a favorable mix of low-cost deposits throughout the year ended 2022, partially offset by a decrease in PPP related income of 18.8 million. The following table presents the key balance sheet metrics as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Consumer Banking segment (dollars in thousands): 

December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs 3,126,615 2,976,200 Total Deposits 9,983,266 10,366,792 LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs, for the Consumer Banking segment increased 150.4 million or 5.1 to 3.1 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021; growth occurred in the residential 1-4 family consumer and auto loan portfolios. Consumer Banking deposits decreased 383.5 million or 3.7 to 10.0 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to deposit balance declines in money market accounts, interest checking accounts, and demand deposits, partially offset by an increase in time deposit balances, which was primarily due to customer behavior in response to inflation and higher market interest rates.

 Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate. The Company s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was 16.2 , 17.2 and 15.1 , respectively. The decrease in the effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the higher proportion of tax-exempt income to pre-tax income. BALANCE SHEET Assets At December 31, 2022, total assets were 20.5 billion, an increase of 396.3 million or 2.0 from December 31, 2021. The increase in assets was primarily a result of a 1.3 billion increase in total LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs, partially offset by a 520.1 million decrease in the net investment securities portfolio due to a decline in the fair value of the AFS portfolio due to market interest rate increases, partially offset by a 219.7 million increase in the HTM portfolio, and a 482.6 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs, were 14.4 billion, including 7.3 million in PPP loans, at December 31, 2022, an increase of 1.3 billion or 9.5 from December 31, 2021. Total adjusted loans, which excludes PPP loans (net of deferred fees and costs) (+) , increased 1.4 billion or 10.7 at December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021.

Total adjusted average loans which excludes PPP loans (net of deferred fees and costs) (+) , increased 855.3 million or 6.7 at December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021. For additional information on the Company s loan activity, please refer to the section Loan Portfolio included within this Item 7 and Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Liabilities and Stockholders Equity At December 31, 2022, total liabilities were 18.1 billion, an increase of 733.7 million from December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings, offset by a decrease in total deposits. Total deposits at December 31, 2022 were 15.9 billion, a decrease of 679.4 million or 4.1 from December 31, 2021. Average deposits at December 31, 2022 decreased 89.6 million or 0.5 from December 31, 2021. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to the impact of inflation and the economy on customer behavior. For additional information on deposits, refer to the section Deposits included within this Item 7. Total short-term and long-term borrowings at December 31, 2022 were 1.7 billion, an increase of 1.2 billion or 237.3 compared to 506.6 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in borrowings was primarily due to an increase of 1.2 billion in short-term FHLB advances used by the Company to fund loan production.

 At December 31, 2022, stockholders equity was 2.4 billion, a decrease of 337.3 million from December 31, 2021. The net decrease was primarily attributable to other comprehensive losses related to the decline in fair value of the AFS portfolio due to market rate increases, partially offset by the impact of earnings retained by the Company during 2022. The Company s consolidated regulatory capital ratios continue to exceed the minimum capital requirements and are considered well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. The following table summarizes the Company s consolidated capital ratios for the periods ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 

2022 2021 Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio 9.95 10.24 Tier 1 capital ratio 10.93 11.33 Total capital ratio 13.70 14.18 Leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) 9.42 9.01 Common equity to total assets 10.78 12.68 Tangible common equity to tangible assets (+) 6.43 8.20 At December 31, 2022, the Company s common equity to total assets capital ratio and tangible common equity to tangible assets capital ratio decreased from the prior year primarily due to the unrealized losses on the AFS securities portfolio recorded in other comprehensive income due to market interest rate increases. During 2022, the Company declared and paid dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock of 687.52 per share (equivalent to 1.72 per outstanding depositary share). During 2022, the Company also declared and paid cash dividends of 1.16 per common share, an increase of 0.07 per share, or 6.4 , over 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no active share repurchase programs, as the repurchase program in effect in 2022 expired on December 9, 2022. Under that repurchase program, the Company repurchased an aggregate of approximately 1.3 million shares (or approximately 48.2 million) in 2022. Securities At December 31, 2022, the Company had total investments of 3.7 billion or 18.1 of total assets, compared to 4.2 billion or 20.9 of total assets at December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the market value of the AFS securities portfolio, which was partially offset by growth in the HTM portfolio. The Company may experience further declines in the AFS portfolio in future periods if market interest rates continue to increase or the FOMC reduces the Federal Reserve s balance sheet more quickly than anticipated. The Company seeks to diversify its investment portfolio to minimize risk, and it focuses on purchasing MBS for cash flow and reinvestment opportunities and securities issued by states and political subdivisions due to the tax benefits and the higher yield offered from these securities. The majority of the Company s MBS are agency-backed securities, which have a government guarantee.

The Company s loan portfolio generally does not include exposure to option adjustable rate mortgage products, high loan-to-value ratio mortgages, interest only mortgage loans, subprime mortgage loans or mortgage loans with initial teaser rates, which are all considered higher risk instruments. Nonperforming Assets At December 31, 2022, NPAs totaled 27.1 million, a decrease of 5.7 million or 17.3 from December 31, 2021.

 Past Due Loans At December 31, 2022 past due loans still accruing interest totaled 30.0 million or 0.21 of total LHFI, compared to 29.9 million or 0.23 of total LHFI at December 31, 2021. Of the total past due loans still accruing interest 7.5 million or 0.05 of total LHFI were loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2022, compared to 9.1 million or 0.07 of total LHFI at December 31, 2021. Troubled Debt Restructurings A modification of a loan s terms constitutes a TDR if the creditor grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider to the borrower for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties. Management strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify their loan to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include rate reductions, extension of terms that are considered to be below market, conversion to interest only, principal forgiveness and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. The total recorded investment in TDRs at December 31, 2022 was 14.2 million, a decrease of 3.8 million or 21.0 from 18.0 million at December 31, 2021. Of the 14.2 million of TDRs at December 31, 2022, 9.3 million or 65.3 were considered performing while the remaining 4.9 million were considered nonperforming. Of the 18.0 million of TDRs at December 31, 2021, 10.3 million or 57.4 were considered performing while the remaining 7.6 million were considered nonperforming. Loans are removed from TDR status in accordance with the established policy described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

The net charge-offs of loans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 remained low, driven by continued low levels of NPAs. Provision for Credit Losses The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 79.9 million or 131.2 from the prior year s negative provision for credit losses of 60.9 million. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected 13.3 million in provision for loan losses and 5.7 million in provision for unfunded commitments . The increased provision for credit losses is due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast and the impact of loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Federal Reserve requires the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5 of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0 of total assets. These ratios, with the exception of the leverage ratio, include a 2.5 capital conservation buffer, which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. On March 27, 2020, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule that allows the Company to phase in the impact of adopting the CECL methodology up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company is allowed to include the impact of the CECL transition, which is defined as the CECL Day 1 impact to capital plus 25 of the Company s provision for credit losses during 2020, in regulatory capital through 2021. The Company elected to phase in the regulatory capital impact as permitted under the aforementioned interim final rule. The CECL transition amount will be phased out of regulatory capital over a three-year period, beginning in 2022 and ending in 2024. The table summarizes the Company s regulatory capital and related ratios for the periods ended December 31, (dollars in thousands):

 MARKET RISK Interest Sensitivity Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk. The Company s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk. The Company s Board of Directors reviews and approves the guidelines established by the asset liability committee. The Company monitors interest rate risk through the use of three complementary modeling tools: static gap analysis, earnings simulation modeling, and economic value simulation (net present value estimation). Each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios. While each of the interest rate risk models has limitations, taken together, they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of the Company s interest rate risk, the distribution of risk along the yield curve, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. The Company s static gap analysis, which measures aggregate re-pricing values, is utilized less often because it does not effectively take into account the optionality embedded into many assets and liabilities and, therefore, the Company does not address it here. The Company uses earnings simulation and economic value simulation models on a regular basis, which more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts, and these models are discussed below. The Company determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies and practices governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These decisions are based on management s expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the states of the national, regional and local economies, and other financial and business risk factors. The Company uses simulation modeling to measure and monitor the effect of various interest rate scenarios and business strategies on net interest income. This modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income and net income over specified time horizons. Earnings Simulation Modeling Management uses earnings simulation modeling to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but the Company believes it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses, such as the static gap analysis noted above. The Company derives the assumptions used in the model from historical trends and management s outlook, including expected loan and deposit growth rates and projected yields and rates. These assumptions may not be realized and unanticipated events and circumstances may also occur that cause the assumptions to be inaccurate. The model also does not take into account any future actions of management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes. The Company monitors the assumptions and periodically adjusts them as deemed appropriate. In the Company s modeling, it is assumed that all maturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are reinvested in like instruments, and the Company bases the MBS prepayment assumptions on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning. The Company also uses different interest rate scenarios and yield curves to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates. Interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and these differences are reflected in the different rate scenarios. The Company uses its earnings simulation model to estimate earnings in rate environments where rates are instantaneously shocked up or down around a most likely rate scenario, based on implied forward rates and futures curves. The analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a 12-month period after an immediate increase or shock in rates, of 100 bps up to 300 bps. The model, under all scenarios, does not drop the index below zero.

 The following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the Company across the rate shocks modeled for balances at the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): 

Change In Net Interest Income December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Change in Yield Curve: +300 basis points 11.73 30.15 +200 basis points 8.25 20.39 +100 basis points 4.65 10.33 Most likely rate scenario -100 basis points (3.18) (9.20) -200 basis points (7.40) (13.62) If an institution is asset sensitive its assets reprice more quickly than its liabilities and net interest income would be expected to increase in a rising interest rate environment, and decrease in a falling interest rate environment. If an institution is liability sensitive its liabilities reprice more quickly than its assets and net interest income would be expected to decrease in a rising interest rate environment and increase in a falling interest rate environment. From a net interest income perspective, the Company was less asset sensitive as of December 31, 2022 compared to its position as of December 31, 2021. This shift is primarily due to the composition of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in the pricing characteristics and assumptions of certain deposits and also due to the implementation of interest rate derivative strategies. In an increasing interest rate environment, the Company would expect an increase in net interest income as interest-earning assets re-price at higher rates than interest-bearing deposits. Economic Value Simulation Modeling Economic value simulation modeling is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. The Company calculates the economic values based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The Company uses the same assumptions in the economic value simulation model as in the earnings simulation model. The economic value simulation model uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet. The following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): 

Change In Economic Value of Equity December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Change in Yield Curve: +300 basis points (12.32) (6.85) +200 basis points (8.41) (3.55) +100 basis points (4.25) (1.22) Most likely rate scenario -100 basis points 3.55 (4.82) -200 basis points 6.41 (12.89) As of December 31, 2022, the Company s economic value of equity is generally less asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment compared to its position as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to the composition of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in the pricing characteristics and assumptions of certain deposits and also due to the implementation of interest rate derivative strategies.

 Liquidity Liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, money market investments, federal funds sold, LHFS, and securities and loans maturing or re-pricing within one year. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Company include its capacity to borrow additional funds when necessary through federal funds lines with several correspondent banks, a line of credit with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the purchase of brokered certificates of deposit, corporate line of credit with a large correspondent bank, and debt and capital issuance. Management believes the Company s current overall liquidity is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs . The Company closely monitors changes in the industry and market conditions that may impact the Company s liquidity. Beginning in 2020 and in much of 2021, the Company saw increased liquidity due to higher customer deposit balances related to government stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, in 2022, as expected, the Company saw these elevated levels of customer deposits begin to decline. The Company will use other means of borrowings or other liquidity sources to fund any liquidity needs based on declines in deposit balances. The Company is also closely tracking the potential impacts on the Company s liquidity of declines in fair value of the Company s securities portfolio due to rising market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, liquid assets totaled 6.0 billion or 29.2 of total assets, and liquid earning assets totaled 5.8 billion or 31.5 of total earning assets. Asset liquidity is also provided by managing loan and securities maturities and cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, loan payments of approximately 5.3 billion or 37.0 of total loans are expected within one year based on contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments, and approximately 296.7 million or 8.0 of total securities are scheduled to be paid down within one year based on contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments. For additional information and the available balances on various lines of credit, please refer to Note 8 Borrowings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Items 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. In addition to lines of credit, the Bank may also borrow additional funds by purchasing certificates of deposit through a nationally recognized network of financial institutions. For additional information and outstanding balances on purchased certificates of deposits, please refer to Deposits within this Item 7. For additional information on cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations, please refer to Capital Resources within this Item 7. Cash Requirements The Company s cash requirements outside of lending transactions relate primarily to borrowings, debt, and capital instruments which are used as part of the Company s overall liquidity and capital management strategy. Cash required to repay these obligations will be sourced from future debt and capital issuances and from other general liquidity sources as described above under Liquidity within this Item 7.

Excluded from these tables are variable lease payments or renewals. For more information pertaining to the previous table, refer to Note 6 Leases and Note 8 Borrowings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Obligations In the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Company s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. For more information on these commitments, refer to Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk. The following table represents the Company s other commitments with balance sheet or off-balance sheet risk as of December 31, (dollars in thousands): 

2022 2021 Commitments with off-balance sheet risk: Commitments to extend credit (1) 5,229,252 5,825,557 Letters of credit 156,459 152,506 Total commitments with off-balance sheet risk 5,385,711 5,978,063 

 (1) Includes unfunded overdraft protection. The Company is also a lessor in sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment, as noted in Note 6 Leases in the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The Company s future commitments related to the aforementioned leases totaled 296 million and 217 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Company s financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K below have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the financial position and operating results to be measured principally in terms of historic dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing

 power of money over time due to inflation. Inflation affects the Company s results of operations mainly through increased operating costs, but since nearly all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, changes in interest rates generally affect the financial condition of the Company to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. Although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. The Company s management reviews pricing of its products and services, in light of current and expected costs due to inflation, to mitigate the inflationary impact on financial performance.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In this Form 10-K, the Company has provided supplemental performance measures on a tax-equivalent, tangible, operating, adjusted or pre-tax pre-provision basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are a supplement to GAAP, which is used to prepare the Company s financial statements and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in its analysis of the Company s performance. The Company s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in the Company s underlying performance. Net interest income (FTE) and total revenue (FTE), which are used in computing net interest margin (FTE), provide valuable additional insight into the net interest margin by adjusting for differences in the tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire FTE adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets, which is used in computing the yield on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the FTE components. The following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

The Company believes tangible common equity, tangible assets, and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful basis for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which the Company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the Company and its ability to absorb potential losses. The Company believes tangible common equity is an important indication of its ability to grow organically and through business combinations as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies.

 ITEM 8. - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) 

Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company s ALLL was 110.8 million. As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company s ALLL represents management s current estimate of expected credit losses over the life of the held for investment (HFI) loan portfolio. The ALLL is estimated by applying statistical loss forecasting models to loan balances pooled by loan type and credit risk indicator, with the exception of certain consumer pools that use vintage and loss rate methods. The models use economic forecast assumptions to estimate credit losses over a two-year forecast period before reverting to long-term average historical loss rates on a straight-line basis over the following two-year period. The Company considers qualitative factors to adjust model output when estimating the ALLL to account for expected loan losses not addressed in the statistical loss models, including uncertainty regarding forecasted economic conditions and its impact on future credit losses. Auditing management s estimate of the ALLL was especially challenging and highly judgmental due to certain qualitative factors management leverages when setting the ALLL.

 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the ALLL process that included, among others, controls over the accuracy of data and key model inputs such as loan risk ratings, the review of economic forecast data, and management review controls over the use of qualitative factors. We involved EY specialists in evaluating the conceptual soundness of the comprehensive framework of the ALLL, including models and certain qualitative elements. EY specialist model testing included evaluating management s statistical models for model design and methodology, model performance, and testing key model assumptions. We also used EY specialists to assist us in testing key model inputs, including the accuracy of credit risk indicators and underlying collateral valuations. To further test the qualitative component of the ALLL, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the appropriateness of the methodology and the consistency of its application, comparing certain economic data points used to support the qualitative factors to third party data, and re-computing components of the qualitative estimation that were quantitatively derived. We inspected management s documentation supporting the use of qualitative factors, tested the completeness of the data supporting the measurement of those factors, and compared changes in those factors to prior periods. We also evaluated if the qualitative reserves were applied based on a comprehensive framework and that available information was considered, well-documented, and consistently applied. We also compared the collective ALLL estimate, inclusive of the qualitative component, to prior periods and industry peers through the use of allowance coverage ratios and charge-off experience for corroboration or potential contrary evidence.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ February 23, 2023

 and of outstanding borrowings and a specific percentage of the member s total assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The FRB requires the Company to maintain stock with a par value equal to of its outstanding capital. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are generally amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for MBS where prepayments are anticipated. Premiums on callable debt securities are amortized to their earliest call date. Discounts on callable debt securities are amortized to their maturity date. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method. The Company regularly evaluates AFS securities whose values have declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit impairment. For AFS securities, the Company evaluates the fair value and credit quality of its AFS securities on at least a quarterly basis. In the event the fair value of a security falls below its amortized cost basis, the security will be evaluated to determine whether the decline in value was caused by changes in market interest rates or security credit quality. The primary indicators of credit quality for the Company s AFS portfolio are security type and credit rating, which are influenced by a number of security-specific factors that may include obligor cash flow, geography, seniority, structure, credit enhancement and other factors.

 ACL held against the Company s AFS securities portfolio at December 31, 2022, consistent with December 31, 2021. See Note 2 Securities, for additional information on the Company s ACL analysis. If unrealized losses are related to credit quality, the Company estimates the credit related loss by evaluating the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security and a credit loss exists, an ACL shall be recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. Non-credit related declines in fair value are recognized in OCI, net of applicable taxes. Changes in the ACL are recorded as a provision for or reversal of credit loss expense. Charge-offs are recorded against the ACL when management believes the AFS security is no longer collectible. A debt security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become delinquent. The Company evaluates the credit risk of its HTM securities on at least a quarterly basis. Management estimates expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on an individual basis based on the PD/LGD methodology primarily using security-level credit ratings. Management has an immaterial ACL on HTM securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off when management judges the loan to be uncollectible but generally no later than past due for non-real estate secured loans and for real estate secured loans. Non-real estate secured consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge off. Commercial loans are typically written down to net realizable value when it is determined that the Company will be unable to collect the principal amount in full and the amount is a confirmed loss. Loans in all classes of portfolios are considered past due or delinquent when a contractual payment has not been satisfied. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal and interest is considered doubtful and in accordance with regulatory requirements. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company offered short-term loan modifications to assist borrowers through a program that expired January 1, 2022. The Company enhanced the monitoring over loans that received modifications, specifically full principal and interest payment deferrals, and considered nonaccrual treatment at which time the Company no longer expected to collect all principal and interest over the life of the loan. The process for charge-offs is discussed in detail within the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses section of this Note 1. For both the commercial and consumer loan segments, all interest accrued but not collected for loans placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off is reversed against interest income and accrual of interest income is terminated. Payments and interest on these loans are accounted for using the cost-recovery method by applying all payments received as a reduction to the outstanding principal balance until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. The determination of future payments being reasonably assured varies depending on the circumstances present with the loan; however, the timely payment of contractual amounts owed for six consecutive months is a primary indicator. The authority to move loans into or out of accrual status is limited to senior Special Assets Officers and the Chief Credit Officer, though reclassification of certain loans may require approval of the Special Assets Loan Committee.

 reasonable and supportable forecast period with a straight-line reversion over the next two years to long-term average loss factors. Individually Assessed Reserve Consideration Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. The individual reserve component relates to loans that have shown substantial credit deterioration as measured by risk rating and/or delinquency status. In addition, the Company has elected the practical expedient that would include loans for individual assessment consideration if the repayment of the loan is expected substantially through the operation or sale of collateral because the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Where the source of repayment is the sale of collateral, the ALLL is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less selling costs, compared to the amortized cost basis of the loan. If the ALLL is based on the operation of the collateral, the reserve is calculated based on the fair value of the collateral calculated as the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral, compared to the amortized cost basis. If the Company determines that the value of a collateral dependent loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the Company charges off the deficiency if it is determined that such amount is deemed uncollectible. Typically, a loss is confirmed when the Company is moving toward foreclosure or final disposition. The Company obtains appraisals from a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisers located in the market in which the collateral is located. The Company s approved appraiser list is continuously maintained by the Company s Real Estate Valuation Group to seek to ensure the list only includes such appraisers that have the experience, reputation, character, and knowledge of the respective real estate market. At a minimum, it is ascertained that the appraiser is

A loan may also be considered for removal from TDR status as a result of a subsequent restructure under certain restrictive circumstances. The removal of TDR designations must be approved by the Company s Special Asset Loan Committee.

 million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, associated with previous merger transactions, which is primarily associated with wholesale banking. The Company follows ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. Goodwill is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life included on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from to , to their estimated residual values. Long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, would no longer depreciated. Management concluded that no circumstances indicating an impairment of these assets existed as of the balance sheet date. The Company performs the analysis annually on April 30 of each year at the reporting unit level whereby the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company moved from reportable operating segment, the Bank, to reportable operating segments, Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking, which resulted in goodwill being allocated between the reportable operating segments based on their relative fair values. The Company determined that there was impairment to the Bank s goodwill prior to and after reallocating goodwill. Refer to Note 17 Segment Reporting and Revenue for additional details on the Company s reportable operating segments. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in performing its annual goodwill impairment analysis. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company utilizes a combination of two separate quantitative methods, the market value approach, which considers comparable publicly-traded companies, and the income approach which estimates future cash flows. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include: the selection of comparable publicly-traded companies and selection of market comparable acquisition transactions. In addition, other key assumptions include the discount rate, the forecast of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit, economic conditions, which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, and loss rates, the cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant, the control premium associated with the reporting unit and a relative weight given to the valuations derived by the two valuation methods. At April 30, 2022, the Company determined that there was impairment to its goodwill. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions and concluded that impairment existed as of the balance sheet date.

The Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent an insurance company is unable to fulfill its financial obligations under a policy. to of the opposite change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If derivative instruments are designated as hedges of fair values, and such hedges are highly effective, both the change in the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are included in current earnings. Fair value adjustments related to cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings. Ineffective portions of hedges are reflected in earnings as they occur. Actual cash receipts and/or payments and related accruals on derivatives related to hedges are recorded as adjustments to the interest income or interest expense associated with the hedged item. During the life of the hedge, the Company formally assesses whether derivatives designated as hedging instruments continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a hedge has ceased to be highly effective, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. At such time, previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are reversed into current earnings and the derivative instrument is reclassified to a trading position recorded at fair value. During the normal course of business, the Company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding rate lock commitments ). For commitments issued in connection with potential loans intended for sale, the Bank enters into positions of forward month MBS to be announced TBA contracts on a mandatory basis or on a one-to-one forward sales contract on a best efforts basis. The Company enters into TBA contracts in order to control interest rate risk during the period between the rate lock commitment and mandatory sale of the mortgage loan. Both the rate lock commitment and the forward TBA contract are considered to be derivatives. A mortgage loan sold on a best efforts basis is locked into a forward sales contract with a counterparty on the same day as the rate lock commitment to control interest rate risk during the period between the commitment and the sale of the mortgage loan. Both the rate lock commitment and the forward sales contract are considered to be derivatives. Mortgage banking derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. The market values of rate lock commitments and best efforts forward delivery commitments are not readily ascertainable with precision because they are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. The Company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments, delivery contracts, and forward sales contracts of MBS by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset, while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close or will be funded. Certain risks arise from the forward delivery contracts in that the counterparties to the contracts may not be able to meet the terms of the contracts. Additional risks inherent in mandatory delivery programs include the risk that, if the Company does not close the loans subject to rate lock commitments, it will still be obligated to deliver MBS to the counterparty under the forward sales agreement. million and million, respectively, and tax credits and tax savings of million and million, respectively, associated with these investments within Income tax expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.

AFS Securities: The Company has entered into a swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk on a portion of its fixed rate AFS securities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate notional amount of the related hedged items of the AFS securities totaled million and the fair value of the swaps associated with the derivative related to hedged items was an unrealized gain of million and unrealized loss of million, respectively. The Company applies hedge accounting in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and the fair value hedge and the underlying hedged item, attributable to the risk being hedged, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows on the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows on the designated hedged item or transactions for the risk being hedged. If a hedging relationship ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the relationship is discontinued and future changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in current period earnings. For a discontinued or terminated fair value hedging relationship, all remaining basis adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining life of the hedged item consistent with the amortization of other discounts or premiums. Previous balances deferred in AOCI from discontinued or terminated cash flow hedges are reclassified to interest income or expense as the hedged transactions affect earnings or over the originally specified term of the hedging relationship. The Company s hedges continue to be highly effective and had no material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest Rate Contracts During the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate contracts with borrowers to help meet their financing needs. Upon entering into interest rate contracts, the Company enters into offsetting positions with a third party in order to minimize interest rate risk. These interest rate contracts qualify as financial derivatives with fair values as reported in Other Assets and Other Liabilities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. RPAs The Company enters into RPAs where it may either sell or assume credit risk related to a borrower s performance under certain non-hedging interest rate derivative contracts on participated loans. The Company manages its credit risk under RPAs by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrowers based on the Company s normal credit review process. RPAs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Other operating income on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets after they are evaluated for impairment. The primary assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are related to foreclosed properties, former bank premises, and collateral-dependent loans that are individually assessed. When the asset is secured by real estate, the Company measures the fair value utilizing an income or market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser using observable market data. Management may discount the value from the appraisal in determining the fair value if, based on its understanding of the market conditions, the collateral had been impaired below the appraised value (Level 3). The assets for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded were million and million during the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The nonrecurring valuation adjustments for these assets did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 825, Financial Instruments , requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim periods and excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. Cash and Cash Equivalents For those short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. HTM Securities The Company s investment portfolio is primarily valued using fair value measurements that are considered to be Level 2. The Company has contracted with a third-party portfolio accounting service vendor for valuation of its securities portfolio. The vendor s primary source for security valuation is ICE, which evaluates securities based on market data. ICE utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs.

 market participants, to validate third party valuations. Any material differences between valuation sources are researched by further analyzing the various inputs that are utilized by each pricing source. No material differences were identified during the validation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company s Level 3 securities are a result of the Access acquisition and are comprised of asset-backed securities and municipal bonds. Valuations of the asset-backed securities are provided by a third-party vendor specializing in the SBA markets, and are based on underlying loan pool information, market data, and recent trading activity for similar securities. Valuations of the municipal bonds are provided by a third-party vendor that specializes in hard-to-value securities, and are based on a discounted cash flow model and considerations for the complexity of the instrument, likelihood it will be called and credit ratings. The Company reviews the valuation of both security types for reasonableness in the context of market conditions and to similar bonds in the Company s portfolio. Any material differences between valuation sources are researched by further analyzing the various inputs that are utilized by each pricing source. No material differences were identified during the validation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Loans and Leases The fair value of loans and leases were estimated using an exit price, representing the amount that would be expected to be received if the Company sold the loans and leases. The fair value of performing loans and leases were estimated through use of discounted cash flows. Credit loss assumptions were based on market PD/LGD for loan and lease cohorts. The discount rate was based primarily on recent market origination rates. Fair value of loans and leases individually assessed and their respective levels within the fair value hierarchy are described in the previous section related to fair value measurements of assets that are measured on a nonrecurring basis. Bank Owned Life Insurance The carrying value of BOLI approximates fair value. The Company records these policies at their cash surrender value, which is estimated using information provided by insurance carriers. Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposits were valued using a discounted cash flow calculation that includes a market rate analysis of the current rates offered by market participants for certificates of deposits that mature in the same period. Accrued Interest The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value.

 The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. Borrowers with fixed rate obligations, however, are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company s overall interest rate risk.

 reportable operating segment, the Bank. In the third quarter of 2022, however, the Company completed system conversions that allow its chief operating decision makers to evaluate the business, establish the overall business strategy, allocate resources, and assess business performance within reportable operating segments Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking while corporate support functions such as corporate treasury and others will be included in Corporate Other. Goodwill was evaluated for impairment prior to re-allocating to the new reportable operating segments based on relative fair value. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s operating segments include the following: Wholesale Banking : The Wholesale Banking segment provides loan and deposit services, as well as treasury management and capital market services to wholesale customers primarily throughout Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These customers include commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. This segment also includes the Company s public finance subsidiary and the equipment finance subsidiary, which has nationwide exposure. Consumer Banking : The Consumer Banking segment provides loan and deposit services to consumers and small businesses throughout Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Consumer Banking includes the home loan division and the wealth management division, which consists of private banking, trust, investment management, and advisory services. Corporate Other: Corporate Other includes the Company s Corporate Treasury functions, such as management of the investment securities portfolio, long-term debt, short-term liquidity and funding activities, balance sheet risk management, and other corporate support functions, as well as intercompany eliminations. The Company restated its segment information for the year ended December 31, 2021 under the new basis with reportable operating segments; however, the Company determined that it is impracticable to restate segment information for the year ended December 31, 2020. Therefore, no such disclosures are presented for 2020, when the Company s only reportable operating segment was the Bank. Segment Reporting Methodology The Company s segment reporting is based on a management approach as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Inter-segment transactions are recorded at cost and eliminated as part of the consolidation process. A management fee for operations and administrative support services is charged to all subsidiaries and eliminated in the consolidated totals. The following is additional information on the methodologies used in preparing the operating segment results: Net interest income: Interest income from LHFI and interest expense from deposits are reflected within respective operating segments. The Company uses a funds transfer pricing methodology which utilizes the matched funding approach to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all operating segment loans and deposits. Provision for credit losses: Provision for credit losses is assigned to operating segments based on the Company s allowance methodology, driven by loan pool level information. Noninterest income: Noninterest fees and other revenue associated with loans or customers are included within each operating segment. Noninterest expense: Certain noninterest expenses incurred by corporate support functions are allocated based on assumptions regarding the extent to which each operating segment actually uses the services. Goodwill: Goodwill is assigned to reportable operating segments based on the relative fair value of each segment.

 (1) Corporate Other includes acquisition accounting fair value adjustments Revenue The majority of the Company s noninterest income is being accounted for in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and comes from short term contracts associated with fees for services provided on deposit accounts and credit cards from the Consumer and Wholesale Banking segments, as well as fiduciary and asset management fees from the Consumer Banking segment. Typically, the duration of a contract does not extend beyond the services performed; therefore, the Company concluded that discussion regarding contract balances is immaterial. The Company s performance obligations on revenue from deposit accounts and interchange fees from the Consumer and Wholesale Banking segments are generally satisfied immediately, when the transaction occurs, or by month-end. Performance obligations on revenue from fiduciary and asset management fees from the Consumer Banking segment are generally satisfied monthly or quarterly. For a majority of fee income on deposit accounts, the Company is a principal controlling the promised good or service before transferring it to the customer. For income related to most wealth management income, however, the Company is an agent responsible for arranging for the provision of goods and services by another party.

 ITEM 9. - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO (2013 framework). Based on the assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective on December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Ernst Young s report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting is included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There was no change in the internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.6 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED As of the filing date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K of which this exhibit (this Exhibit is a part, Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation (the Company had the following outstanding securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ): (i) common stock, 1.33 par value per share (the Common Stock ), and (ii) depositary shares (the Depositary Shares ), each representing a 1/400 th ownership interest in a share of the Company s 6.875 Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ). Description of Common Stock The following description of the material features of the Common Stock does not purport to be complete and is in all respects subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of Virginia law and by the Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, effective May 7, 2020, as amended by Articles of Amendment effective June 9, 2020 (the Articles ), and the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective December 5, 2019 (the Bylaws ). The Articles and Bylaws are included as exhibits to the Form 10-K. General The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of Common Stock. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Dividends The Company s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends or distributions that the Company s Board of Directors (the Board may declare out of funds legally available for those payments. The payment of distributions by the Company is subject to the restrictions of Virginia law applicable to the declaration of distributions by a corporation. A Virginia corporation generally may not authorize and make distributions if, after giving effect to the distribution, it would be unable to meet its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or if the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if it were dissolved at that time, to satisfy the preferential rights of shareholders whose rights are superior to the rights of those receiving the distribution. In addition, the payment of distributions to shareholders is subject to any prior rights of holders of outstanding preferred stock. 

As a bank holding company, the Company s ability to pay dividends is affected by the ability of Atlantic Union Bank, its bank subsidiary, to pay dividends to the Company. The ability of the Company s bank subsidiary, as well as the Company, to pay dividends in the future is, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines. Liquidation Rights In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of shares of the Common Stock will be entitled to receive, after payment of all debts and liabilities of the Company and after satisfaction of all liquidation preferences applicable to any preferred stock, all remaining assets of the Company available for distribution in cash or in kind. Voting Rights Holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share, and in general, a majority of votes cast with respect to a matter is sufficient to authorize action upon routine matters. Directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested director elections. The Company maintains a plurality vote standard in contested director elections (i.e., where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected). Holders of the Common Stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Directors The Board is elected annually with directors serving an annual one-year term. Currently, the Board consists of 12 directors. Under the Articles, directors may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. Vacancies occurring in the Board by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the Board, and any directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of directors by the shareholders. Any other vacancy in the Board, whether by reason of death, resignation, removal or otherwise, may be filled by the remaining directors and any directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such directors shall have been chosen and until their successors are elected and qualified. No Preemptive Rights; Redemption and Assessment Holders of shares of the Common Stock will not be entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. The Common Stock is not subject to redemption or any sinking fund and the outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable. Securities Are Not Insured by the FDIC Investments in the Common Stock or any of the Company s equity or debt securities will not qualify as deposits or savings accounts and will not be insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal. 

Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Company s Articles and Bylaws and Virginia Law General . The Articles and Bylaws and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the Virginia SCA contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Board to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions, and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences and other terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Common Stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even though such transaction may be favorable to the interests of shareholders, and could potentially adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. The following briefly summarizes protective provisions that are contained in the Articles and Bylaws and provided by the Virginia SCA. This summary is necessarily general and is not intended to be a complete description of all the features and consequences of those provisions, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and Bylaws and the statutory provisions contained in the Virginia SCA. Supermajority Provision . The Virginia SCA provides that, unless a corporation s articles of incorporation provide for a greater or lesser vote, certain significant corporate actions must be approved by the affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Certain corporate actions requiring a more than two-thirds vote include: adoption of plans of merger or share exchange; sales of all or substantially all of a corporation s assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and adoption of plans of dissolution. The Virginia SCA provides that a corporation s articles may either increase the vote required to approve those actions or may decrease the vote required to not less than a majority of all the votes cast by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists. The Virginia SCA provides that a corporation s articles may either increase the vote required to approve those actions or may decrease the vote required to not less than a majority of all the votes cast by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists. The Articles state that the actions set out above must be approved by a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the transaction by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present, provided that the transaction has been approved and recommended by at least two-thirds of the directors in office at the time of such approval and recommendation. If the transaction is not so approved and recommended, then the transaction 

must be approved by the vote of 80 or more of all votes entitled to be cast on such transactions by each voting group entitled to vote on the transaction. The provisions of the Articles and the Virginia SCA could tend to make the acquisition of the Company more difficult to accomplish without the cooperation or favorable recommendation of the Board. State Anti-Takeover Statutes . Virginia has two anti-takeover statutes in force, the Affiliated Transactions Statute and the Control Share Acquisitions Statute. The Affiliated Transaction Statute of the Virginia SCA contains provisions governing affiliated transactions. These include various transactions such as mergers, share exchanges, sales, leases, or other dispositions of material assets, issuances of securities, dissolutions, and similar transactions with an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is generally the beneficial owner of more than 10 of any class of a corporation s outstanding voting shares. During the three years following the date a shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, any affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder must be approved by both a majority (but not less than two) of the disinterested directors (those directors who were directors before the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or who were recommended for election by a majority of the disinterested directors) and by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the corporation s voting shares other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. These requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among other things, a majority of the disinterested directors approve the interested shareholder s acquisition of voting shares making such a person an interested shareholder before such acquisition. Beginning three years after the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the corporation may engage in an affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder if: the transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporation s voting shares, other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder; the affiliated transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or subject to certain additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the holders of each class or series of voting shares will receive consideration meeting specified fair price and other requirements designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equivalent consideration, regardless of when they tendered their shares. Under the Virginia SCA s Control Share Acquisitions Statute, voting rights of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation acquired by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership levels of 20 , 33 1/3 , and 50 of the outstanding shares may, under certain circumstances, be denied. The voting rights may be denied: unless conferred by a special shareholder vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, other than shares held by the acquiring person and officers and directors of the corporation; or 

among other exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to a merger agreement with the corporation or the corporation s articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the acquisition of such shares before the acquiring person s acquisition thereof. If authorized in the corporation s articles of incorporation or bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to redeem the acquired shares at the average per share price paid for such shares if the voting rights are not approved or if the acquiring person does not file a control share acquisition statement with the corporation within 60 days of the last acquisition of such shares. If voting rights are approved for control shares comprising more than 50 of the corporation s outstanding stock, objecting shareholders may have the right to have their shares repurchased by the corporation for fair value. Corporations may provide in their articles of incorporation or bylaws to opt-out of the Affiliated Transactions Statute or the Control Share Acquisitions Statute. The Company has not opted-out of the Affiliated Transactions Statute or the Control Share Acquisitions Statute, and the Bylaws provide that it may, but is not required to, redeem shares of the Common Stock which have been the subject of a control share acquisition as defined in the Control Share Acquisitions Statute. Authorized Preferred Stock . As described below, the Articles authorize the issuance of preferred stock and the Board may, subject to application of Virginia law and federal banking regulations, authorize the issuance of preferred stock at such times, for such purposes and for such consideration as the Board may deem advisable without further shareholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances may have the effect of discouraging an attempt by a third party to acquire control of the Company by, for example, authorizing the issuance of a series of preferred stock with rights and preferences designed to impede the proposed transaction. Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors . The Virginia SCA provides that in any proceeding brought by or in the right of a corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the corporation, the damages assessed against an officer or director arising out of a single transaction, occurrence or course of conduct may not exceed the lesser of (a) the monetary amount, including the elimination of liability, specified in the articles of incorporation or, if approved by the shareholders, in the bylaws as a limitation on or elimination of the liability of the officer or director, or (b) the greater of (i) 100,000 or (ii) the amount of cash compensation received by the officer or director from the corporation during the twelve months immediately preceding the act or omission for which liability was imposed. The liability of an officer or director is not limited under the Virginia SCA or a corporation s articles of incorporation and bylaws if the officer or director engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or of any federal or state securities law. The Articles provide that, to the full extent that the Virginia SCA permits the limitation or elimination of liability of directors or officers, a director or officer of the Company is not liable to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages. A Virginia corporation generally is authorized to indemnify its directors and officers in civil and criminal actions if they acted in good faith and believed their conduct to be in the best interests 

of the corporation and, in the case of criminal actions, had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful. The Virginia SCA requires such indemnification when a director or, unless limited by a corporation s articles of incorporation, officer entirely prevails in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she was a party because he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, and further provides that a corporation may make any other or further indemnity (including indemnity to a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation), and may make additional provision for advances and reimbursement of expenses, if authorized by its articles of incorporation or shareholder-adopted bylaw or resolution, except an indemnity against willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law. The Virginia SCA establishes a statutory limit on liability of officers and directors of a corporation for damages assessed against them in a suit brought by or in the right of the corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the corporation and authorizes a corporation to specify a lower monetary limit on liability (including the elimination of liability for monetary damages) in the corporation s articles of incorporation or bylaws; however, the liability of an officer or director will not be limited if such officer or director engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or of any federal or state securities law. The Articles provide that, to the full extent permitted by the Virginia SCA, the Company is required to indemnify a director or officer against liabilities, fines, penalties and claims imposed upon or asserted against him or her by reason of having been a director or officer and against all expenses reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith, except in relation to matters as to which he or she is liable by reason of his or her willful misconduct or knowing violation of criminal law. Dissenters and Appraisal Rights . The Virginia SCA provides that appraisal or dissenters rights are not available to holders of shares of any class or series of shares of a Virginia corporation in a merger when the stock is either listed on a national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, or is held by at least 2,000 shareholders of record and has a public float of at least 20 million. Despite this exception, appraisal or dissenters rights will be available to holders of common stock of a Virginia corporation in a merger if: the articles of incorporation provide for appraisal or dissenters rights regardless of an available exception (the Articles do not authorize such special appraisal or dissenters rights); in the case of a merger or share exchange, shareholders are required by the terms of the merger to accept anything for their shares other than cash, shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation, or shares of another corporation that are either listed on a national securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 shareholders of record having a public float of at least 20 million, or a combination of cash or such shares; or the merger is an affiliated transaction, as described under State Anti-Takeover Statutes above, and it has not been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors. 

The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, unless one of the exceptions outlined above applies to a given transaction, holders of the Common Stock are not entitled to appraisal or dissenters rights. Amendments to the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws . The Virginia SCA generally requires that in order for an amendment to the articles of incorporation to be adopted it must be approved by each voting group entitled to vote on the proposed amendment by more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by that voting group, unless the Virginia SCA otherwise requires a greater vote, or the articles of incorporation provide for a greater or lesser vote, or a vote by separate voting groups. However, under the Virginia SCA, no amendment to the articles of incorporation may be approved by a vote that is less than a majority of all the votes cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists. Under the Virginia SCA, unless another process is set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a majority of the directors (except to the extent authority to amend the bylaws is reserved by the Virginia SCA), or, if a quorum exists at a meeting of shareholders, a majority of the shareholders present and entitled to vote may adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws. The Articles state that an amendment to the articles of incorporation must be approved by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present, provided that the amendment has been approved and recommended by at least two-thirds of the directors in office at the time of such approval and recommendation. If the amendment is not so approved and recommended by two-thirds of the directors in office, then the amendment must be approved by the affirmative vote of 80 or more of all of the votes entitled to be cast on such amendment by each voting group entitled to vote. The Bylaws may be amended, altered, or repealed by the Board any time. The Company s shareholders have the power to rescind, alter, amend, or repeal any bylaws and to enact bylaws which, if so expressed by the shareholders, may not be rescinded, altered, amended, or repealed by the Board. Increasing the Number of Directors . Under Virginia law, a board of directors may amend or repeal bylaws unless its company s articles of incorporation or other provisions of Virginia law reserve such power exclusively in the shareholders or the shareholders, in adopting or amending particular bylaws, expressly prohibit the board of directors from amending or repealing that bylaw. The Articles do not reserve the power to amend the Bylaws to increase or decrease the number of directors exclusively to the shareholders and no bylaw, and no amendment thereto, expressly prohibits the Board from amending the Bylaws to increase or decrease the number of directors. Any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of authorized directors shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office. As a result, if faced with an attempt to take control of the Board, the Board may increase the size of the Board and install directors opposed to the hostile takeover attempt. 

Inability of Shareholders to Call Special Meetings . Pursuant to the Bylaws, special meetings of shareholders may be called only by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Board or the Board s Executive Committee. As a result, shareholders are not able to act on matters other than at annual shareholders meetings unless they are able to persuade the Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chairman or the Vice Chairman of the Board to call a special meeting. Advance Notification Requirements . The Bylaws require a shareholder who desires to nominate a candidate for election to the Board or to raise new business at an annual shareholders meeting to provide the Company advance notice not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one-hundred twentieth day, prior to the first anniversary of the commencement of the preceding year s annual meeting of shareholders, provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by such shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one-hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of shareholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder s notice as described above. The Bylaws further condition the presentation of shareholder nominations for director or proposals for business on compliance with a number of conditions. In addition, a shareholder must also comply with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission in order for his or her shareholder proposal to be included in the Company s proxy statement relating to the annual meeting. Listing of Common Stock The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AUB. Description of Preferred Stock The following description of the material features of the Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is in all respects subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of Virginia law and by the Articles and the Bylaws. General The Series A Preferred Stock is a single series of the Preferred Stock. Shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The depositary is the sole holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of Depositary Shares are required to exercise their proportional rights in the Series A Preferred Stock through the depositary, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. Shares of the Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to the Common Stock and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock the Company has or may issue if provided for in the 

articles of amendment relating to such preferred stock or otherwise (except for any senior stock that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other parity stock, if any), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. See Other Preferred Stock below. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available assets for such payment (after satisfaction of all claims for indebtedness and other non-equity claims). Further, the Series A Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the Company enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding, including a proceeding under the Orderly Liquidation Authority of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock. The Company reserves the right to reopen the Series A Preferred Stock and issue additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock either through public or private sales at any time and from time to time that may or may not involve additional Depositary Shares. The additional shares would form a single series with the Series A Preferred Stock already outstanding. In addition, the Company may from time to time, without notice to or consent of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Depositary Shares, issue additional shares of preferred stock that rank equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends General Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are not cumulative. If the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of a dividend period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such dividend period, be payable on the applicable dividend payment date, or be cumulative, and the Company will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that dividend period, whether or not the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board declares a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock for any subsequent dividend period. A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Virginia law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 6.875 per annum for each quarterly dividend period from the original issue date of the Depositary Shares through the redemption date of the Series A Preferred Stock, if any. In the event that the Company issues additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares will accrue from the original issue date of such additional shares. 

If declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board, the Company will pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock quarterly in arrears, on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each such date, a dividend payment date ). If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next business day without any adjustment to the amount of dividends paid. A business day means any weekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York, and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York, are closed. Dividends are payable to holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company s stock register on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before the applicable dividend payment date, or such other record date, not exceeding 30 days before the applicable payment date, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board. The corresponding record dates for the Depositary Shares will be the same as the record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock. A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will cease to accrue on the redemption date, if any, as described below under Redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption. Additional Information The Company s ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock depends on the ability its subsidiaries, including Atlantic Union Bank, to pay dividends to the Company. The ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future is subject to bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines and policies established by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ). So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, (1) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any junior stock (other than (i) a dividend payable solely in junior stock or (ii) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan), (2) no shares of junior stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than (i) as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, (ii) the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock, (iii) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of junior stock, (iv) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of junior stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (v) purchases of shares of junior stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy junior stock existing prior to 

the preceding dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (vi) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of junior stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (vii) purchases or other acquisitions by any of the Company s broker-dealer subsidiaries solely for the purpose of market making, stabilization or customer facilitation transactions in junior stock in the ordinary course of business, (viii) purchases by any of the Company s broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company s capital stock for resale pursuant to an offering by the Company of such capital stock underwritten by such broker-dealer subsidiary, or (ix) the acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of record ownership in junior stock for the beneficial ownership of any other persons (other than for the beneficial ownership by the Company or any of its subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Company and (3) no shares of parity stock, if any, shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly, during a dividend period (other than (i) pursuant to pro rata offers to purchase all, or a pro rata portion, of the Series A Preferred Stock and such parity stock, if any, (ii) as a result of a reclassification of parity stock for or into other parity stock, (iii) the exchange or conversion of parity stock for or into other parity stock or junior stock, (iv) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of parity stock, (v) purchases of shares of parity stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy parity stock existing prior to the preceding dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (vi) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of parity stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (vii) purchases or other acquisitions by any of the Company s broker-dealer subsidiaries solely for the purpose of market making, stabilization or customer facilitation transactions in parity stock in the ordinary course of business, (viii) purchases by any of the Company s broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company s capital stock for resale pursuant to an offering by the Company of such capital stock underwritten by such broker-dealer subsidiary, or (ix) the acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of record ownership in parity stock for the beneficial ownership of any other persons (other than for the beneficial ownership by the Company or any of its subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Company unless, in each case, the full dividends for the preceding dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment. The Company will not declare or pay or set apart funds for the payment of dividends on any parity stock, unless the Company has paid or set apart funds for the payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and parity stock, if any, all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and parity stock, if any, will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share on the Series A Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, if any, on parity stock, if any, bear to each other. As used in this Exhibit, junior stock means the Common Stock and any other class or series of stock of the Company hereafter authorized over which the Series A Preferred Stock has 

preference or priority in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, the Common Stock is the only series of junior stock outstanding. As used in this Exhibit, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, there are no series of parity stock outstanding. See Other Preferred Stock below. As used in this Exhibit, senior stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, there are no series of senior stock outstanding. See Other Preferred Stock below. Subject to the considerations described above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board, may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Company to fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines. Redemption Optional Redemption The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its option, in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after September 1, 2025, at a redemption price equal to 10,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date. Neither the holders of Series A Preferred Stock nor holders of Depositary Shares will have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock. Redemption Following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 10,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption 

up to the redemption date. A regulatory capital treatment event means the good faith determination by the Company that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of Series A Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of Series A Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Company will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation value of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding as Tier 1 Capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of Federal Reserve Regulation Y (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking regulator or agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding. Redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to the Company s receipt of any required prior approvals from the Federal Reserve and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve applicable to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. Redemption Procedures If shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be sent to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if the Depositary Shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through DTC, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth: the redemption date; the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by the holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed from the holder; the redemption price; and the place or places where the certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price. On and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, including the rights described under Voting Rights below, except the right to receive the redemption price plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date. See Description of Depositary Shares for information about redemption of the Depositary Shares relating to the Series A Preferred Stock. 

In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. Under the Federal Reserve s current risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve. Any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to the Company s receipt of any required prior approval by the Federal Reserve and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve applicable to redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. Neither the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock nor the holders of the related Depositary Shares have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock. Liquidation Rights In the event the Company liquidates, dissolves or wind-ups its business and affairs, either voluntarily or involuntarily, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution of 10,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends before the Company makes any distribution of assets to the holders of the Common Stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidating distribution. In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences plus declared and unpaid dividends in full to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of parity stock, if any, as to such distribution with the Series A Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and parity stock, if any, will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distribution owed to those holders. If the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and parity stock, if any, the holders of the Company s junior stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available assets for such payment (after satisfaction of all claims for indebtedness and other non-equity claims). Further, the Series A Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the Company enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding, including a proceeding under the Orderly Liquidation Authority of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ). 

For purposes of this section, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Because the Company is a holding company, the Company s rights and the rights of the Company s creditors and the Company s shareholders, including the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to participate in the assets of any of the Company s subsidiaries, including Atlantic Union Bank, upon that subsidiary s liquidation or recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary s creditors, except to the extent that the Company is a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. Voting Rights Except as provided below, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights. Right to Elect Two Directors upon Nonpayment If the Company fails to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on the Board shall be increased by two at the Company s first annual meeting of the shareholders held thereafter, and at such meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting until continuous noncumulative dividends for at least one year on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled thereto shall have been paid in full, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting as a class together with holders of any other equally ranked series of preferred stock that have similar voting rights, if any, to elect such two additional members of the Board to hold office for a term of one year; provided that the Board shall at no time include more than two additional directors elected by holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any other equally ranked series of preferred stock having similar voting rights, if any, voting together as one class. Upon such payment in full, the terms of the two additional directors so elected shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors shall be reduced by two, and such voting right of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease, subject to increase in the number of directors as described above and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, as described above. In addition, if and when the rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock terminate for any reason, including under circumstances described above under Redemption, such voting rights shall terminate along with the other rights (except, if applicable, the right to receive the redemption price plus any declared and unpaid dividends), and the terms of any additional directors elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any other equally ranked series of preferred stock having similar voting rights, if any, shall terminate automatically and the number of directors reduced by two, assuming that the rights of holders of such equally ranked series of preferred stock have similarly terminated. 

Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, if the holders of any series of preferred stock are or become entitled to vote separately for the election of directors as a class, such series, along with any other holders of stock that are entitled to vote for the election of directors with that series, will be deemed a class of voting securities. A company holding 25 or more of that class, or less if it otherwise exercises a controlling influence over the Company, will be subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act ). In addition, at the time the series is deemed a class of voting securities, any other bank holding company or systemically significant nonbank financial company will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to acquire or retain more than 5 of that class. Any other person (other than a bank holding company or systemically significant nonbank financial company) will be required to obtain the non-objection of the Federal Reserve under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, to acquire or retain 10 or more of that class. Other Voting Rights So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be required to: authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue shares of, any class or series of senior stock, or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares; amend the provisions of the Articles so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized Common Stock or preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; or consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation with or into another entity unless (i) the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the new surviving entity and (ii) the shares of the remaining Series A Preferred Stock or new preferred securities have terms that are not materially less favorable than the Series A Preferred Stock. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed. 

Voting Rights under Virginia Law Except as expressly set forth in the Articles, the Virginia SCA does not provide any additional voting rights to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. Therefore, under the Virginia SCA, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will only have those voting rights set forth above under Voting Rights. Other Preferred Stock The Articles authorize the Board to create and provide for the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock, par value 10.00 per share, without the approval of the Company s shareholders. The Board can also determine the terms, including the designations, powers, preferences and rights (including conversion, voting and other rights) and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of any preferred stock. Currently, 500,000 shares of the Company s capital stock are classified as preferred stock under the Articles. As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, the Company has 6,900,000 Depositary Shares issued and outstanding, representing 17,250 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The representative Depositary Shares are summarized below under Description of Depositary Shares. Depositary Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the depositary, and, collectively with Computershare Inc., is the transfer agent and registrar for the Series A Preferred Stock. The Company may, in its sole discretion, remove the depositary in accordance with the Deposit Agreement (as defined below); provided that the Company will appoint a successor depositary who will accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of its removal. Information Rights During any period in which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will use its best efforts to (i) make available on its website at https://www.atlanticunionbank.com copies of the annual and quarterly reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, if the Company was subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than any exhibits that would have been required), within the time periods that would apply if the Company was required to file those reports with the SEC if the Company was a non-accelerated filer within the meaning of the Exchange Act; and (ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies of such reports to any holder or prospective holder of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company will use its best efforts to mail (or otherwise provide) its annual and quarterly reports to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses appear in the Company s record books and without cost to such holders, within 15 days after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, would have been required to be filed with the SEC, if the Company was subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, based on the dates on which the Company would be required to file such periodic reports if it was a non-accelerated filer within the meaning of the Exchange Act. 

Preemptive and Conversion Rights The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock do not have any preemptive or conversion rights. Description of Depositary Shares The following description of the material features of the Depositary Shares relating to the Series A Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is in all respects subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of Virginia law and by the Articles and the Bylaws. General The Depositary Shares represent proportional fractional interests in shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. Each Depositary Share represents a 1/400th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, and is evidenced by depositary receipts. The Company has deposited the underlying shares of the Series A Preferred Stock with a depositary pursuant to a deposit agreement among the Company, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., acting as depositary, Computershare Inc. and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares (the Deposit Agreement ). Subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement, each holder of a Depositary Share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). Dividends and Other Distributions Each dividend payable on a Depositary Share will be in an amount equal to 1/400th of the dividend declared and payable on the related share of the Series A Preferred Stock. The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series A Preferred Stock to the record holders of Depositary Shares relating to the underlying Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by the holders. If the Company makes a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute any property received by it to the record holders of Depositary Shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the Depositary Shares. Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the Depositary Shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock. The amounts distributed to holders of Depositary Shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other 

governmental charges. The depositary may refuse to make any payment or distribution, or any transfer, exchange, or withdrawal of any Depositary Shares or the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock until such taxes or other governmental charges are paid. Redemption of Depositary Shares If the Company redeems the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares, the Depositary Shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per Depositary Share is expected to be equal to 1/400th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (or 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of Depositary Shares representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding Depositary Shares are redeemed, the depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pro rata or by lot. The depositary will send notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 15 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock and the related Depositary Shares (provided that, if the Depositary Shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through DTC, the depositary may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Voting the Preferred Stock Because each Depositary Share represents a 1/400th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400th of a vote per Depositary Share under those limited circumstances in which holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote. When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will send the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the Depositary Shares relating to the Series A Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the Depositary Shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series A Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the holder s Depositary Shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company has agreed to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any Depositary Shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock, it will not vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares. 

Depositary Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the depositary and, collectively with Computershare Inc., is the transfer agent and registrar for the Depositary Shares. The Company may, in its sole discretion, remove the depositary in accordance with the Deposit Agreement; provided that the Company will appoint a successor depositary who will accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of its removal. Listing of Depositary Shares The Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AUB.PRA.

Important Disclaimer Benefits under the Plan are provided solely pursuant to the Insurance Policy issued by the Insurance Company to the Participant.

Eligibility and Participation Requirements Eligibility Enrollment Executive officers whose annual base salary exceeds 300,000 as of the effective date of the Plan are eligible and became Participants provided they enrolled prior to September 20, 2019. Thereafter, employees hired or promoted to the status of executive officer and whose compensation exceeds 300,000 become eligible and will become Participants upon notification and the completion of enrollment. Termination of Participation Your participation in the Plan terminates on the date you terminate employment with the Company or a Participating Employer. However, since you are the owner of the Insurance Policy, you may continue to pay the premiums following your termination of employment and keep the coverage in place.

5. Summary of Plan Benefits Available Benefits The Plan makes supplemental individual disability insurance available to Participants, which, along with the Group LTD offered by the Employer, will cover 60 of your pre-tax base salary up to a combined maximum monthly benefit of 30,000, or in the case of Participants whose annual base salary exceeds 600,000, up to a combined maximum monthly benefit of 55,000. 6. Circumstances That May Affect Benefits Denial, Loss, or Recovery of Benefits The Plan may recover overpaid benefits, erroneously paid benefits and certain other benefits through its rights to reimbursement. These Plan rights are described in the Insurance Policy. Right to Information and Fraudulent Claims Any person claiming benefits under the Plan shall furnish the Insurance Company with such information and documentation as may be necessary to verify eligibility for and/or entitlement to benefits under the Plan. The Plan Administrator and the Insurance Company shall have the right and opportunity to have a Participant examined when benefits are claimed, and when and so often as it may be required during the pendency of any claim under the Plan. If a person is found to have falsified any document in support of coverage or a claim for benefits under the Plan, or failed to have corrected information which such person knows or should have known to be incorrect, or failed to bring such misinformation to the attention of the Plan Administrator or the Insurance Company, the Plan Administrator may, without the consent of any person, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, terminate the person s Plan coverage, including retroactively. In addition, the Insurance Company may refuse to honor any claim for benefits under the Plan for the Participant related to the person submitting the falsified information. Such person shall be responsible, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to provide restitution, including monetary repayment to the Plan, with respect to any overpayment or ineligible payment of benefits. Other Exclusions Other circumstances that can result in the termination, reduction, loss or denial of benefits are described in the Insurance Policy. Please read it carefully. Administrative Requirements and Timelines As described in the Insurance Policy, there may be other reasons that a claim for benefits 
 4 

is not paid (or not paid in full). For example, claims must generally be submitted within a certain period of time, and failure to submit within that time period may result in the claim being denied. Please read the Insurance Policy carefully. 7. How the Plan Is Administered Plan Operations The Company administers the Plan. However, because benefits are provided through an Insurance Policy, benefit claims are administered by the Insurance Company. Plan Administration The Company is the Plan Administrator but may appoint a committee or other entity or person to administer the Plan from time to time, or perform certain administrative functions. As the Plan Administrator, the Company is responsible for satisfying certain legal requirements under ERISA with respect to the Plan (for example, distributing SPDs and filing an annual report about the Plan with the government). Power and Authority of Insurance Company The Plan is fully insured. Benefits are provided under the Insurance Policy issued to the Participant. Claims for benefits are sent to the Insurance Company. The Insurance Company, not the Company, is responsible for determining and paying claims on your behalf. The Insurance Company is the Named Fiduciary for benefit claims and is responsible for: determining eligibility for a benefit and the amount of any benefits payable under the Plan; and providing the claims procedures to be followed and the claims forms to be used by eligible individuals pursuant to the Plan. 
 The Insurance Company also has the authority to require eligible individuals to furnish it with such information as it determines is necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. Determining Eligibility to Participate The Company is responsible for determining whether a particular individual is eligible to participate in the Plan. Your Questions If you have any general questions regarding the Plan (including, for example, whether you are eligible to participate in the Plan), please contact Susan E. Pfautz at 804-327-7535 . 
 5 

If you have questions regarding eligibility for a specific benefit and/or the amount of any benefits payable under the Plan, please contact the Insurance Company. 8. Amendment or Termination of the Plan The Company, as Plan Sponsor, has the right to amend or terminate any part or all of Plan at any time. The Plan may be amended or terminated by a written instrument signed by the Company. Note that the Insurance Policy, which is how benefits under the Plan are provided, is not necessarily the same as the Plan. Consequently, termination of the Plan does not necessarily terminate the Insurance Policy. 9. No Contract of Employment The Plan is not intended to be, and may not be construed as constituting, a contract or other arrangement between you and the Company to the effect that you will be employed for any specific period of time. 11. Claims and Appeals Procedures In General The specific guidelines for filing a Claim or a request for a review of a denied claim are set forth in the Insurance Policy. 12. Statement of ERISA Rights Your Rights As a Participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that all plan Participants shall be entitled to: Receive Information About the Plan and Benefits Examine, without charge, at the Company s principal office and at other specified locations, such as worksites, all documents governing the Plan, including insurance contracts, and a copy of the latest annual report Form 5500 Series), if any, filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. Obtain, upon written request to the Company, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan, including insurance contracts and copies of the latest annual report Form 5500 Series) and updated SPD. The Company may make a reasonable charge for the copies. Receive a summary of the Plan s annual Form 5500, if any is required by ERISA to be prepared, in which case the Company, as Plan Administrator, is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. 
 6 

Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your Employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforce Your Rights If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps that you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report (Form 5500), if any, from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Company, as Plan Administrator, to provide the materials and pay you up to 110 per day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored in whole or in part, and if you have exhausted the claims procedures available to you under the Plan, you may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan s money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor; or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance With Your Questions If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Company. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor (listed in your telephone directory), or contact the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

undertaken by Executive s email address will be attributed to Executive, Executive will keep Executive s email (or DocuSign or other electronic signature verification) account and password secure and not disclose or allow access by any other persons. Executive understands and agrees that a record or signature signed electronically may not and shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form and further agrees not to challenge such electronic signature.

Eligible Positions; Participation Participation is limited to those executives recommended by the Chief Executive Officer (the Plan Sponsor and approved by the Committee. The Committee shall retain the discretion to include as a Participant any otherwise-eligible executive hired or promoted after the commencement of a Plan Year. 2. Basis of Incentive Compensation Awards The Plan is a cash award plan. The Participant s incentive compensation award under the Plan is based on an incentive target that is approved at the beginning of the Plan Year by the Committee in its discretion. The incentive compensation award is expressed as a percentage of the Participant s base salary at the end of the Plan Year, and may be awarded if either or both the Atlantic Union corporate performance goals (the Corporate Goals and the Participant s individual performance goals (the Individual Goals are achieved. In no event shall a Participant receive payment under the Plan that exceeds 200 of the Participant s base salary as of the end of the Plan Year. 3. Plan Details The amount of an incentive compensation award that the Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan is determined based on the Participant s incentive target and weighting, achievement of the approved performance goals and taking into account individual performance specifically attributable to each participant and reflective of their role and area of responsibility. A. Award Targets and Weightings Each Participant shall be assigned an incentive target, calculated as a percentage of the Participant s base salary, which may be awarded if Atlantic Union and the Participant achieve targeted performance goals. The incentive compensation award shall be weighted between Corporate Goals and Individual Goals. The weightings for the two goal categories shall be recommended by the Plan Sponsor and approved by the Committee. Threshold, target and superior achievement levels for each Corporate Goal will be recommended by the Plan Sponsor and approved by the Committee. The payout for the threshold achievement level will be not less than 50 of the target payout, and the payout for the superior achievement level will be not more than 200 of the target payout. B. Corporate Goals The Corporate Goals for the Plan Year will be recommended by the Plan Sponsor and approved by the Committee. C. Individual Goals Individual Goals for the Plan Year will be established for the Participant in conjunction with his or her direct supervisor and approved by the Committee (or its delegee). 

 D. Determination of Incentive Compensation Award Following the end of the Plan Year, the Committee will review performance against the Corporate Goals and any Individual Goals established for the Participant, certify in writing that the applicable performance goals were satisfied, and determine the amount of the incentive compensation award, if any, to be paid to each Participant under the Plan. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in making this determination, the Committee may, in its discretion, in light of such considerations as it may deem relevant, increase or decrease an incentive compensation award to which a Participant would otherwise be entitled by such amount or percentage as the Committee deems appropriate. Unless the Committee deems otherwise, an incentive compensation award will not be earned or paid, regardless of Corporate or Individual performance, if 1) any regulatory agency issues a formal, written enforcement action, memorandum of understanding or other negative directive action to Atlantic Union or the Bank and where the Committee considers it imprudent to provide awards under the Plan, or 2) if after a review of the Bank s credit quality measures the Committee considers it imprudent to provide awards under the Plan. A sample incentive compensation award calculation is set forth on the attached Appendix A . 4. Payment of Awards An incentive compensation award under the Plan will be calculated and paid in cash on an annual basis.

All incentive compensation awards under the Plan are subject to the terms of Atlantic Union s Compensation Clawback Policy or similar policy as such may be in effect from time to time, as well as any similar provisions of applicable federal law or regulation and any applicable listing standard of the national securities exchange on which Atlantic Union s common stock is listed, which could in certain circumstances require repayment of an incentive compensation award or portion thereof. 13. Banking Regulatory Provision All incentive compensation awards under the Plan are subject to any condition, limitation or prohibition under any financial institution regulatory policy or rule to which Atlantic Union or the Bank is subject. 14.
