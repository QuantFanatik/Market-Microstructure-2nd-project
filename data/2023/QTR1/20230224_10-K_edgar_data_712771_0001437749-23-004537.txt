Our Market Area 
 
 ConnectOne Bank's offices are located primarily in the New York metro market and span New Jersey, New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson Valley, including Rockland, Orange, and Westchester counties. Through high tech tools and service, the Bank is able to extend its reach supporting clients as they move into new markets, such as South Florida where we opened an office in West Palm Beach in August 2022. Our market area includes some of the most affluent markets in the United States. The Bank's goal is to continue to expand and do business to support our clients as they grow. Advances in technology have created new delivery channels that allow us to service clients and maintain business relationships with a reduced-branch model, establishing regional offices that serve as business hubs. The Bank's experience has shown that the key to client acquisition and retention is attracting quality business relationship officers who will frequently go to the client, rather than having the client come to us. 
 
 BoeFly operates out of its main offices in Boston, Massachusetts and New York, and has a nationwide presence through its digital business marketplace. 
 
 Products and Services 
 
 We derive a majority of our revenue from net interest income (i.e., the difference between the interest we receive on our loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings). We offer a broad range of deposit and loan products. In addition, to attract the business of consumer and business clients, we provide a broad array of other banking services. Products and services provided include personal and business checking accounts, money market accounts, time and savings accounts, credit cards, wire transfers, safe deposit boxes, access to automated teller services and telephone, internet and mobile banking. We offer Retirement accounts to Consumers and Cash Management services to business clients that include Treasury Direct, Automated Clearing House ("ACH") origination, Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) and Digital Invoicing. 
 
 Non-interest demand deposit products include Totally Free Checking and Simply Better Checking for consumer clients and Small Business Checking and Analysis Checking for commercial clients. Interest-bearing checking accounts require minimum balances for both consumer and commercial clients and include Consumer Interest Checking and Business Interest Checking . Money market accounts consist of products that provide a market rate of interest to depositors. Our savings accounts offer paper and/or electronic statements. Time deposits (TD) are for non-retirement and IRA accounts, generally with initial maturities ranging from 31 days to 60 months, and brokered TDs, which we use for asset liability management purposes and to supplement other sources of funding. CDARS/ICS Reciprocal deposits are offered based on the Bank s participation in the IntraFi Network LLC network, formerly known as Promontory Interfinancial Network. Clients, who are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance sensitive, are able to place large dollar deposits with the Company and the Company utilizes CDARS to place those funds into certificates of deposit issued by other banks in the Network. This occurs in increments of less than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage in amounts larger than the insured dollar amount. Unless certain conditions are satisfied, the FDIC considers these funds as brokered deposits. 
 
 Deposits serve as the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets, but also generate noninterest revenue through insufficient funds fees, stop payment fees, wire transfer fees, safe deposit rental fees, debit card income, including foreign ATM fees and credit and debit card interchange, and other miscellaneous fees.] In addition, the Bank generates additional noninterest revenue associated with residential, commercial and Small Business Administration SBA loan originations and sales, loan servicing, late fees and merchant services. 
 
 We offer consumer and commercial business loans on a secured and unsecured basis, revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgage loans, and residential mortgages on both primary and secondary residences, home equity loans, bridge loans and other personal purpose loans. However, we are not and have not historically been a participant in the sub-prime lending market. 
 
 Commercial loans are loans made for business purposes and are primarily secured by collateral such as business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and mortgages filed on commercial and residential real estate. Furthermore, cash balances, and marketable securities will be considered provided they are held by or under the control of the Bank. 
 
 Commercial construction loans are loans to finance the construction of commercial or residential properties secured by first liens on such properties. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by first liens on completed commercial properties, including multi-family properties, to purchase or refinance such properties. Residential mortgages include loans secured by first liens on 1-4 family, condominium and Cooperative residential real estate and are generally made to existing clients of the Bank to purchase or refinance primary and secondary residences. Home equity loans and lines of credit include loans secured by first or second liens on residential real estate for primary or secondary residences. Consumer loans are made to individuals who qualify for auto loans, cash reserve, credit cards and installment loans.

During 2021 and 2020, we participated in the Small Business Administration s SBA Paycheck Protection Program PPP created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). The PPP provided funds to guarantee forgivable loans originated by depository institutions to eligible small businesses through the SBA s 7(a) loan guaranty program. These loans are 100 federally guaranteed (principal and interest) and currently not subject to any allocation of allowance for credit losses. An eligible business could apply under the PPP during the applicable covered period and receive a loan up to 2.5 times its average monthly payroll costs limited to a loan amount of 10.0 million. The proceeds of the loan could be used for payroll (excluding individual employee compensation over 100,000 per year), mortgage, interest, rent, insurance, utilities and other qualifying expenses. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0 , (b) a two-year loan term (or five-year loan term for loans made after June 5, 2020) to maturity; and (c) principal and interest payments deferred until the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the borrower s lender or, alternatively, notifies the lender no loan forgiveness is allowed. If the borrower did not submit a loan forgiveness application to the lender within 10 months following the end of the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period (or the 8-week loan forgiveness covered period with respect to loans made prior to June 5, 2020 if such covered period is elected by the borrower), the borrower would begin paying principal and interest on the PPP loan immediately after the 10-month period. 
 
 On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act became law. Among other things, the Economic Aid Act extended the PPP through March 31, 2021 and allocated additional funds for new PPP loans, to be guaranteed by the SBA. The extension included an authorization to make new PPP loans to existing PPP loan borrowers, and to make loans to parties that did not previously obtain a PPP loan. The Company participated in the extended PPP. Loans originated under the extended PPP have substantially the same terms as under the original PPP. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 11.4 million in total PPP loans outstanding and not yet forgiven. 
 
 The Board of Directors has approved a credit policy granting designated lending authorities to specific officers of the Bank. Those officers are comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Senior Credit Officers, Managing Directors, Team Leaders and the Consumer Loan Officers. All loan approvals require the signatures of a minimum of two officers. The Senior Lending Group (Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Credit Officer and Chief Lending Officer) can approve loans up to 35 million in aggregate loan exposure with no policy exceptions and up to 30 million with policy exceptions. Furthermore, the Senior Lending Group has authority to approve unsecured loan amounts without policy exceptions up to 10 million and up to 5 million with an exception. Loans to insiders must be approved by the entire Board. 
 
 The Bank s lending policies generally provide for lending within our primary trade area. However, the Bank will make loans to persons outside of our primary trade area when we deem it prudent to do so. To promote a high degree of asset quality, the Bank focuses primarily upon offering secured loans. However, the Bank does make short-term unsecured loans to borrowers with higher net worth and income profiles. The Bank generally requires loan clients to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank. In addition, the Bank generally provides for a minimum required rate of interest in its variable rate loans. The Bank s legal lending limit to any one borrower is 15 of the Bank s capital base (defined as tangible equity plus the allowance for credit losses) for most loans 158.1 million) and 25 of the capital base for loans secured by readily marketable collateral 263.5 million). As of December 31, 2022, the Bank s largest committed relationship (to several affiliated borrowers) was 177.1 million and single largest loan outstanding was 54.6 million. 
 
 Our business model includes using industry best practices for community banks, including personalized service, state-of-the-art technology and extended hours. We believe that this will generate deposit accounts with somewhat larger average balances than are found at many other financial institutions. We also use pricing techniques in our efforts to attract banking relationships having larger than average balances. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The banking business is highly competitive. We face substantial immediate competition and potential future competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, many of which have assets, capital and lending limits larger than those that we have. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities. In addition, the banking industry in general faces competition for deposit, credit and money management products from non-bank technology firms, or fintech companies, which may offer products independently or through relationships with insured depository institutions. 
 
 Our larger competitors have greater financial resources to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns. Additionally, we endeavor to compete for business by providing high quality, personal service to clients, client access to our decision-makers and competitive interest rates and fees. We seek to hire and retain quality employees who desire greater responsibility than may be available working for a larger employer.

Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 
 Our employees are one of our greatest assets and we believe they provide us with an advantage over our competitors. We believe we have a talented, diverse team of financial experts and relationship specialists who understand the demands of a successful business and are prepared to meet them. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 507 full-time employees, and 8 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. 
 
 We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. We have formalized our commitment to training, education and mentoring through our ConnectOne University program. 
 
 ConnectOne University houses our training, leadership development, continuing education and mentorship programs. Through ConnectOne University, employees: 

Receive and complete required job training related to their position with the Company, such as compliance and ethics training and position specific training. Classes include an ABA approved curriculum as well as other third party and Company proprietary courses; 

May take classes to attain job specific certifications to help with career development; 

May take continuing education classes related to other positions and operations at the Company; 

May take business related continuing education classes at partner community colleges and other institutions through a New Jersey State grant program; 

May participate in career mentoring programs in which employees meet with senior officers of the Company to discuss career development; and 

May participate in a tuition reimbursement program under which the Company will reimburse employees for up to 5,250 in tuition expense related to approved business-related course work at any school. 

During 2022, 236 employees participated in our leadership and mentoring programs within ConnectOne University. 
 
 Through ConnectOne University, we also sponsor two employees each year to attend the Stonier Graduate School of Banking. This is a competitive process requiring an employee to be nominated by the employee s manager and then participate in a panel interview. 
 
 We continuously assess any skill gaps and are gearing learning for the banking positions of the future. 
 
 The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through our technology and teamwork, we were able to transition, over a short period of time, substantially all of our non-branch employees to a remote working environment while still servicing the needs of our clients. Branch locations have operated in a variety of ways: closed to lobby traffic, in person banking by appointment only, curbside banking and always with COVID-19 safety protocols at the forefront. When we were able to resume substantial in office employee participation, we took a number of steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, including adhering to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and state guidelines for in-office work (limiting occupancy in the buildings, social distancing, mask requirements, limiting in person meetings). We also developed COVID-19 protocols as a resources for all employees in the event someone was exposed. Currently, the Bank is operating under a hybrid schedule that combines working remotely as well as the ability to work out of our offices. We feel the flexibility of a hybrid approach will aid in employee retention, as well as new employee recruitment. The Bank remains in compliance with all government requirements related to the pandemic. 
 
 Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and is key to our ability to compete against larger competitors. We focus on promoting employees from within and leveraging their knowledge of the organization as we continue to grow our Bank. In 2022, 73 employees were promoted into new roles.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 
 The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Company or the Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions. 
 
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the Holding Company Act ). As a bank holding company, the Company is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FRB and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by the FRB. 
 
 The Holding Company Act prohibits the Company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by the Company of more than 5 of the voting stock of any other bank. Satisfactory capital ratios and Community Reinvestment Act ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB, embodied in FRB regulations, provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank(s) and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank(s) in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy. 
 
 As a New Jersey-charted commercial bank and an FDIC-insured institution, acquisitions by the Bank require approval of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the Banking Department and the FDIC, an agency of the federal government. The Holding Company Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below, allows the Company to expand into insurance, securities, merchant banking activities, and other activities that are financial in nature, in certain circumstances. 
 
 Regulation of Bank Subsidiary 
 
 The operations of the Bank are subject to requirements and restrictions under federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services which may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding company s non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Under federal law, a bank subsidiary may only make loans or extensions of credit to, or invest in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries) or to any affiliate, or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, upon satisfaction of various regulatory criteria, including specific collateral loan to value requirements.

The Dodd-Frank Act 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act, adopted in 2010, will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, as a result of the significant regulatory and compliance changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below: 

Minimum Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required capital rules and the application of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. In addition to making bank holding companies subject to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries, these provisions (often referred to as the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act) were also intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking regulators to seek to make capital standards countercyclical, so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. See Capital Adequacy Guidelines for a description of capital requirements adopted by U.S. federal banking regulators in 2013 and the treatment of trust preferred securities under such rules. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Bureau ). The Dodd-Frank Act created the Bureau. The Bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The Bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the Bureau and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the Bureau against state-chartered institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets. Institutions with 10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. Although the Bank currently has slightly less than 10 billion in assets, and so is not subject to examination by the Bureau, it is likely that the Bank will exceed 10 billion in total assets in the foreseeable future, and so will become subject to examination by the Bureau. 

Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the 250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution s deposit insurance premium paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer based on the institution s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15 to 1.35 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio at 2.0 . 

Shareholder Votes . The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies like the Company to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments in certain circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials.

Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, many of the requirements called for have yet to be fully implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. In addition, some of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act that were implemented have already been revised. See Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act below. Given the uncertainty associated with the way the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements (which, in turn, could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional capital) or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. 
 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. 
 
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA ), adopted in May of 2018, was intended to provide regulatory relief to midsized and regional banks. While many of its provisions are aimed at larger institutions, such as raising the threshold to be considered a systemically important financial institution to 250 billion in assets from 50 billion in assets, many of its provisions will provide regulatory relief to those institutions with 10 billion or more in assets, as well as to those institutions with less than 10 billion in assets. Among other things, the EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for depository institutions and holding companies to perform stress tests required under Dodd Frank from 10 billion to 250 billion, exempted institutions with less than 10 billion in consolidated assets from the Volcker Rule, raised the threshold for the requirement that publicly traded holding companies have a risk committee from 10 billion in consolidated assets to 50 billion in consolidated assets, directed the federal banking agencies to adopt a community bank leverage ratio , applicable to institutions and holding companies with less than 10 billion in assets, and to provide that compliance with the new ratio would be deemed compliance with all capital requirements applicable to the institution or holding company (See -Capital Adequacy Guidelines ), and provided that residential mortgage loans meeting certain criteria and originated by institutions with less than 10 billion in total assets will be deemed to meet the ability to repay rule under the Truth in Lending Act. In addition, the EGRRCPA limited the definition of loans that would be subject to the higher risk weighting applicable to High Volatility Commercial Real Estate. 
 
 Certain of the regulations needed to implement the EGRRCPA have yet to be promulgated by the federal banking agencies, and others have not been fully implemented or enforced and so it is still uncertain how full implementation of the EGRRCPA will affect the Company and the Bank. 
 
 Regulation W 
 
 Regulation W codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. The Company is considered to be an affiliate of the Bank. In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in covered transactions with affiliates: 

to an amount equal to 10 of the bank s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and 

to an amount equal to 20 of the bank s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates. 

In addition, a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. A covered transaction includes: 

a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; 

a purchase of, or an investment in, securities issued by an affiliate; 

a purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions; 

the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party; and 

the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. 

-12-

Table of Contents 

Further, under Regulation W: 

a bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate; 

covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices; and 

with some exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by certain types of collateral with a market value ranging from 100 to 130 of the loan value, depending on the type of collateral, of the amount of the loan or extension of credit. 

Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the FRB decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates. 
 
 FDICIA 
 
 Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA ), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which an insured depository institution such as the Bank would be considered well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be well capitalized. 
 
 The FDIC s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as well capitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 , (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 , (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 , (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5 , and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as adequately capitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 , (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 , (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 , has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5 , and (v) does not meet the definition of well capitalized. An institution will be classified as undercapitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 , or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution will be classified as significantly undercapitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 , or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less 3.0 . An institution will be classified as critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 . An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 
 
 In addition, significant provisions of FDICIA required federal banking regulators to impose standards in a number of other important areas to assure bank safety and soundness, including internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, credit underwriting, asset growth, compensation, loan documentation and interest rate exposure.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines 
 
 In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as Basel III. In July 2013, the FRB, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules (the New Rules ), which implement certain provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 
 Under the New Rules, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets: 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5 (the CET1 ); 

Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital of 6.0 ; and 

Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) of 8.0 . 

In addition, the Company and the Bank will be subject to a leverage ratio of 4 (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements). 
 
 The New Rules also require a capital conservation buffer. Under this provision, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain a 2.5 capital conservation buffer, which is composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios described above, resulting in the following minimum capital ratios: 

CET1 of 7 ; 

Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.5 ; and 

Total Capital Ratio of 10.5 . 

The purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio above the minimum set forth above but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 
 The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased in on January 1, 2019. 
 
 The New Rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to CET1. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds 10 of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of CET1. 
 
 Under the New Rules, banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank may make a one-time permanent election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income items in determining regulatory capital ratios. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income items for purposes of determining regulatory capital. 
 
 While the New Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, holding companies with less than 15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, may permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.

Table of Contents 

The New Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Depending on the nature of the assets, the risk categories generally range from 0 for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600 for certain equity exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the New Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 
 
 Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the New Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets. 
 
 In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations implementation of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments CECL ). Under the CARES Act, the effective date for the implementation of ASU No. 2016-13 was delayed until the earlier of the end of the health crises caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic or December 31, 2020. The Economic Aid Act then further delayed implementation until the earlier of the end of the health crises caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic or January 1, 2022. The final rule also provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. The Company adopted the CECL standard effective January 1, 2021. 
 
 On September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule providing simplified capital requirements for certain community banking organizations (banks and holding companies) with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, implementing provisions of EGRRCPA discussed above. Under the rule, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework or continue to measure capital under the existing Basel III requirements set forth in the New Rules. The new rule took effect January 1, 2020, and qualifying community banking organizations could elect to opt into the new community bank leverage ratio CBLR in their call report for the first quarter of 2020. 
 
 A qualifying community banking organization QCBO is defined as a bank, a savings association, a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company with: 

a leverage capital ratio of greater than 9.0 ; 

total consolidated assets of less than 10.0 billion; 

total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25 or less of total consolidated assets; and 

total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5 or less of total consolidated assets. 

A QCBO opting into the CBLR must maintain a CBLR of 9.0 , subject to a two-quarter grace period to come back into compliance, provided that the QCBO maintains a leverage ratio of more than 8.0 during the grace period. A QCBO failing to satisfy these requirements must comply with the Basel III requirements as implemented by the New Rules. The numerator of the CBLR is Tier 1 capital, as calculated under present rules. The denominator of the CBLR is the QCBO s average assets, calculated in accordance with the QCBO s Call Report instructions and less assets deducted from Tier 1 capital. 
 
 The Company and the Bank have elected not to opt into the CBLR. 
 
 Federal Deposit Insurance and Premiums 
 
 The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. 
 
 The assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is an institution s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. In connection with adopting this assessment base calculation, the FDIC lowered total base assessment rates to between 2.5 and 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. The Company paid 2.8 million and 2.9 million in total FDIC assessments in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Table of Contents 

The FDIC has a designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits, of 1.35 . The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than 10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35 from the former statutory minimum of 1.15 . 
 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 
 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the Modernization Act ): 

allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital, and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities than previously was permissible, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, if the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company. Thereafter it may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals; 

allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; 

removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and 

establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. 

The Modernization Act also modified other financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment. The Company has elected not to become a financial holding company. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA ), as implemented by FDIC regulations, an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of every bank, to assess the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such bank.

USA PATRIOT Act 
 
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through domestic security measures, surveillance powers, information sharing, and anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act encourages information-sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrift institutions, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
 
 Among other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act imposes the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

All financial institutions must establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum: (i) internal policies, procedures, and controls; (ii) specific designation of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training programs; and (iv) an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program. 

The Secretary of the Department of Treasury, in conjunction with other bank regulators, is authorized to issue regulations that provide for minimum standards with respect to client identification at the time new accounts are opened. 

Financial institutions that establish, maintain, administer, or manage private banking accounts or correspondent accounts in the United States for non-United States persons or their representatives (including foreign individuals visiting the United States) are required to establish appropriate, specific and, where necessary, enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect and report money laundering. 

Financial institutions are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks (foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any country), and will be subject to certain record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. 

Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications. 

The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of implementing regulations which address various requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and are applicable to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their clients.

Loans to Related Parties 
 
 The Company s authority to extend credit to its directors and executive officers, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation O promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank s capital. In addition, the Bank s Board of Directors must approve all extensions of credit to insiders. 
 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 
 The Parent Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Virtually all the revenue of the Parent Corporation available for payment of dividends on its capital stock will result from amounts paid to the Parent Corporation by the Bank. All such dividends are subject to the laws of the State of New Jersey, the Banking Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA and the regulations of the Banking Department and of the FDIC. 
 
 Under the New Jersey Corporation Act, the Parent Corporation is permitted to pay cash dividends provided that the payment does not leave us insolvent. As a bank holding company under the BHCA, we would be prohibited from paying cash dividends if we are not in compliance with any capital requirements applicable to us, including our required capital conservation buffer. However, as a practical matter, for so long as our major operations consist of ownership of the Bank, the Bank will remain our source of dividend payments, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to any restrictions applicable to the Bank. 
 
 The Parent Corporation has outstanding a series of perpetual preferred stock, our 5.25 Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. The rights of the preferred stockholders to receive dividends are senior to the rights of our common holders, although the preferred dividend rights are non-cumulative. Therefore, unless all dividends due on our outstanding preferred stock have been declared and paid for the most recent dividend period, we may not pay a dividend on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock. 
 
 Under the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, dividends may be paid by the Bank only if, after the payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the Bank will be unimpaired and either the Bank will have a surplus of not less than 50 of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the Bank s surplus. The payment of dividends is also dependent upon the Bank s ability to maintain adequate capital ratios pursuant to applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
 The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. FRB regulations also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized, and under regulations implementing the Basel III accord, a bank holding company s ability to pay cash dividends may be impaired if it fails to satisfy certain capital buffer requirements. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 An investment in our securities involves risks. Stockholders should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making any purchase or sale decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our securities may decline, and stockholders may lose part or all of their investment in our securities. 
 
 Risks Applicable to Our Business: 
 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and such effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. 
 
 Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and its variants and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have weighed on the macroeconomic environment in our New Jersey/New York metropolitan market trade area, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to mitigate the virus, and such measures, even as certain of them have been eased, have impacted consumer and business spending. 
 
 In addition, the pandemic has changed consumer and employee behavior, such as through the rise in working from home, in ways that may negatively impact the overall economy of our Metropolitan New York economy and the businesses of our customers. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, including the passage of the CARES Act and the Economic Aid Act, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion. 
 
 The outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our borrowers, clients and business partners. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors impacting us or our borrowers, clients or business partners, including but not limited: 

o 
 to credit losses resulting from financial stress being experienced by our borrowers as a result of the outbreak and related governmental actions, particularly in the hospitality, energy and retail industries, but across other industries as well. As of December 31, 2022, the bank had no loans on deferrals; 

o 
 declines in collateral values; 

o 
 third party disruptions, including outages at network providers and other suppliers; 

o 
 increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity; and 

o 
 operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions. 

These factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. 
 
 The extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, new variants of the virus and their impact, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. 
 
 There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described in this Risk Factors section.

Our growth-oriented business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees or if we lose the services of our senior management team. 
 
 We may not be able to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on our management and operations that may result from growth. Our ability to manage growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. The loss of members of our senior management team, including those officers named in the summary compensation table of our proxy statement, could have a material adverse effect on our results or operations and ability to execute our strategic goals. Our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent client relationships and to hire, train and manage our employees. 
 
 We may need to raise additional capital to execute our growth-oriented business strategy. 
 
 In order to continue our growth, we will be required to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at levels higher than the minimum ratios set by our regulators. We can offer you no assurances that we will be able to raise capital in the future, or that the terms of any such capital will be beneficial to our existing security holders. In the event we are unable to raise capital in the future, we may not be able to continue our growth strategy. 
 
 We have a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans. 
 
 Our loan portfolio is made up largely of commercial real estate loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to a higher degree of credit risk of non-payment and loss than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors, including dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment, and loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term. In addition, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot completely eliminate all risks related to these loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our clients or a significant default by our clients would materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 6.2 billion of commercial real estate loans (nonowner-occupied, owner-occupied and multifamily), including construction loans, which represented 76.3 of loans receivable. Concentrations in commercial real estate are monitored by regulatory agencies and subject to scrutiny. Guidance from these regulatory agencies includes all commercial real estate loans, including commercial construction loans, in calculating our commercial real estate concentration, but excludes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Based on this regulatory definition, our commercial real estate loans represented 483 of the Bank s Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses on loans. 
 
 Loans secured by owner-occupied real estate are reliant on the operating businesses to provide cash flow to meet debt service obligations, and as a result may be more susceptible to the general impact on the economic environment affecting those operating companies as well as the real estate. 
 
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of remote work or hybrid work models on the metropolitan New York area commercial real estate market is uncertain, causing volatility in rents in certain core urban markets. Many other factors, including the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, potential international trade tariffs, inflation and changes in federal tax laws affecting the deductibility of state and local taxes and mortgage interest could negatively impact our local economy and real estate market. Accordingly, it may be more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner, as commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development of their properties. The deterioration of one or a few of our commercial real estate loans could cause a material increase in our level of nonperforming loans, which would result in a loss of revenue from these loans and could result in an increase in the provision for credit losses and/or an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our net income. We also may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates, which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. Any weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default of these loans, which could negatively impact our loan portfolio s performance and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, we could incur material losses. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management time and attention, and materially and adversely affect us.

Federal banking agencies have issued guidance regarding high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within bank loan portfolios. The guidance requires financial institutions that exceed certain levels of commercial real estate lending compared with their total capital to maintain heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If there is any deterioration in our commercial real estate portfolio or if our regulators conclude that we have not implemented appropriate risk management practices, it could adversely affect our business, and could result in the requirement to maintain increased capital levels. Such capital may not be available at that time and may result in our regulators requiring us to reduce our concentration in commercial real estate loans. 
 
 If we are limited in our ability to originate loans secured by commercial real estate, we may face greater risk in our loan portfolio. 
 
 If, because of our concentration of commercial real estate loans, or for any other reasons, we are limited in our ability to originate loans secured by commercial real estate, we may incur greater risk in our loan portfolio. For example, we are and may continue to seek to further increase our growth rate in commercial and industrial loans, including both secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers businesses and personal guarantees. Secured commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and typically include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly, and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Therefore, we may be exposed to greater risk of loss on these credits. 
 
 The nature and growth rate of our commercial loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks. 
 
 Given the significant growth in our loan portfolio, many of our commercial real estate loans are unseasoned, meaning that they were originated relatively recently. As of December 31, 2022, we had 5.8 billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding. Approximately 67.4 of the loans, or 3.9 billion, had been originated in the past three years. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our expectations, which could negatively affect our performance. 
 
 The small-to medium-sized businesses that the Bank lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan to the Bank that could materially harm our operating results. 
 
 The Bank targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small-to medium-sized businesses. These small-to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact our market areas could cause the Bank to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. 
 
 Our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our clients and caring about our clients and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in New Jersey corporate law may make it difficult and expensive to remove current management. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in New Jersey law may render the removal of our existing board of directors and management more difficult. Consequently, it may be difficult and expensive for our stockholders to remove current management, even if current management is not performing adequately.

Competition in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability. 
 
 We face substantial competition in originating loans. This competition currently comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and other lenders, including online fintech companies. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans. 
 
 In attracting deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. 
 
 These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. 
 
 We have also been active in competing for New York and New Jersey governmental and municipal deposits. As of December 31, 2022, governmental and municipal deposits accounted for approximately 797.6 million in deposits. The governor of New Jersey has proposed that the state form and own a bank in which governmental and municipal entities would deposit their excess funds, with the state-owned bank then financing small businesses and municipal projects in New Jersey. Although this proposal is in the very early stages, should this proposal be adopted and a state-owned bank formed, it could impede our ability to attract and retain governmental and municipal deposits. 
 
 Increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations, which may increase our cost of funds. 
 
 We also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and governmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services, reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. 
 
 In addition, the banking industry in general faces competition for deposit, credit and money management products from non-bank technology firms, or fintech companies, which may offer products independently or through relationships with insured depository institutions. 
 
 External factors, many of which we cannot control, may result in liquidity concerns for us. 
 
 Liquidity risk is the potential that the Bank may be unable to meet its obligations as they come due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. 
 
 Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividend payments to shareholders. 
 
 Liquidity is derived primarily from deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; prepayment and maturities of loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations, and access to other funding sources. In addition, in recent periods we have substantially increased our use of alternate deposit origination channels, such as brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposit services, and internet listing services.

Table of Contents 

Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to market factors or an adverse regulatory action against us. In addition, our ability to use alternate deposit origination channels could be substantially impaired if we fail to remain well capitalized . Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Declines in the value of our investment securities portfolio may adversely impact our results. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 634.9 million in investment securities, available-for-sale. We may be required to record impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value below their amortized cost basis that is considered credit related. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information on investment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough, it could affect the ability of the Bank to upstream dividends to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios. 
 
 The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations, which, to the extent that the Company requires such dividends in the future, may affect the Company s ability to honor its obligations and pay dividends. 
 
 As a bank holding company, the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations. We currently depend on the Bank s cash and liquidity to pay our operating expenses and to fund dividends to shareholders. We cannot assure you that in the future the Bank will have the capacity to pay the necessary dividends and that we will not require dividends from the Bank to satisfy our obligations. Various statutes and regulations limit the availability of dividends from the Bank. It is possible, depending upon our and the Bank s financial condition and other factors, that bank regulators could assert that payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends, we may not be able to service our obligations, as they become due, or pay dividends on our capital stock. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 
 
 In addition, as described under Capital Adequacy Guidelines, banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5 . Banking institutions which do not maintain capital in excess of the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on the payment of dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Accordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to the Company may be prohibited or limited. 
 
 We may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock if we have not made required dividend payments on our outstanding, noncumulative preferred stock. 
 
 We have a series of outstanding perpetual preferred stock, our 5.25 Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. The rights of the preferred stockholders to receive dividends are senior to the rights of our common holders, although the preferred dividend rights are non-cumulative. Therefore, unless all dividends due on our outstanding preferred stock have been declared and paid for the most recent dividend period provided for under the terms of the preferred stock, we may not pay a dividend on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock during that period.

We may incur impairment to goodwill. 
 
 We review our goodwill at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis results in an impairment to our goodwill, we would be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions. 
 
 Since January 1, 2019, we have acquired GHB, BoeFly and BNJ. To be successful as a larger institution, we must successfully integrate the operations and retain the clients of acquired institutions, attract and retain the management required to successfully manage larger operations, and control costs. 
 
 Future results of operations will depend in large part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired institutions and retain the clients of those institutions. If we are unable to successfully manage the integration of the separate cultures, client bases and operating systems of the acquired institutions, and any other institutions that may be acquired in the future, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, to successfully manage substantial growth, we may need to increase noninterest expenses through additional personnel, leasehold and data processing costs, among others. In order to successfully manage growth, we may need to adopt and effectively implement policies, procedures and controls to maintain credit quality, control costs and oversee our operations. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in this strategy. 
 
 We may be challenged to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on management and operations that may result from growth. The ability to manage growth will depend on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. Success will also depend on the ability of officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent client relationships and to hire, train and manage employees. 
 
 Finally, substantial growth may stress regulatory capital levels, and may require us to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that we will be able to raise any required capital, or that it will be able to raise capital on terms that are beneficial to stockholders. 
 
 Attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future. 
 
 We expect that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in acquiring other target companies if we pursue such acquisitions. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators will consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders equity per share of our common stock. 
 
 Hurricanes or other adverse weather or health related events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 
 Hurricanes and other weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. In addition, these weather events may result in a decline in value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses. Finally, health related events, such as a viral pandemic, could adversely affect the business of our clients and our local economies, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.

The Company will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements when total assets exceed 10 billion. 
 
 The Company s total assets were 9.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Banks with assets in excess of 10 billion are subject to requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, including: the examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assess compliance with Federal consumer financial laws, imposition of higher FDIC premiums, and reduced debit card interchange fees, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings. 
 
 As the Company approaches 10 billion in total consolidated assets, additional costs have been incurred to prepare for the implementation of these imposed requirements. The Company may be required to invest more significant management attention and resources to evaluate and continue to make any changes necessary to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, Federal financial regulators may require accelerated actions and investments to prepare for compliance before 10 billion in total consolidated assets is exceeded, and may suspend or delay certain regulatory actions, such as approving a proposed merger, if preparations are deemed inadequate. Upon reaching this threshold, the Company faces the risk of failing to meet these requirements, which may negatively impact results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Reforms to and uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect the business. 
 
 In 2017, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC , was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. The ARRC announced Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR , a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies have directed U.S. insured depository institutions to cease using LIBOR in new loan or other financial agreements effective December 31, 2021. Certain LIBOR maturity rates will no longer be published after December 31, 2021, with publication of the remaining maturity rates ending in 2023.The Federal Reserve Bank commenced publication of SOFR rates on April 2, 2018. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions may adversely affect the value of and return on the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Risks Applicable to the Banking Industry Generally: 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. 
 
 Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for credit losses and to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, as well as the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. If our judgment proves to be incorrect, our allowance may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio. Further, state and federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance and may require an increase in our allowance for credit losses. Further increases to the allowance could adversely affect our earnings. 
 
 Changes in interest rates, including increases to address inflation, as well as other actions the Federal Reserve may take to address inflation, may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. 
 
 Our net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FOMC ), and market interest rates. 
 
 A sustained increase in market interest rates, such as has been in effect during the second half of 2022, could adversely affect our earnings if our cost of funds increases more rapidly than our yield on our earning assets and compresses our net interest margin. In addition, the economic value of portfolio equity would decline if interest rates increases. 

-25-

Table of Contents 

Different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. We expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets. 
 
 We also attempt to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. 
 
 In addition to increases in interest rates, the FOMC has also changed its stance on monetary policy as an additional effort to reduce inflation. Beginning in the second half of 2022, the FOMC began reducing its balance sheet, implementing a program of quantitative tightening to reduce the overall money supply. As a result, we may face greater competition for deposits, resulting in a higher cost of funds and a reduced net interest margin, as well as greater liquidity risk to continue to fund our loan originations. We are unable to predict the duration and ultimate impact of the FOMC s quantitative tightening program. However, if the program significantly tightens the nation s money supply, it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. 
 
 The banking business is subject to significant government regulations. 
 
 We are subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation and control. These laws and regulations are subject to change and may require substantial modifications to our operations or may cause us to incur substantial additional compliance costs. In addition, future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the commercial banking industry and our operations. Such governing laws can be anticipated to continue to be the subject of future modification. Our management cannot predict what effect any such future modifications will have on our operations. In addition, the primary focus of Federal and state banking regulation is the protection of depositors and not the shareholders of the regulated institutions. 
 
 For example, implementation of all required regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act may result in substantial new compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Generally, the Dodd-Frank Act is effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to specific sections of the law, many of which will not become effective until various Federal regulatory agencies have promulgated rules implementing the statutory provisions. Ultimately, final implementation the Dodd-Frank Act could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 In addition, in order to implement Basel III and certain additional capital changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on July 9, 2013, the Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. insured depository institutions and their holding companies. This regulation requires financial institutions to maintain higher capital levels and more equity capital. 
 
 These provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The ultimate effect of certain of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.

Table of Contents 

The laws that regulate our operations are designed for the protection of depositors and the public, not our shareholders. 
 
 The federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our operations give regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement responsibilities, and generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. These laws and regulations can materially affect our future business. Laws and regulations now affecting us may be changed at any time, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations by bank regulatory authorities is also subject to change. 
 
 We can give no assurance that future changes in laws and regulations or changes in their interpretation will not adversely affect our business. Legislative and regulatory changes may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for non-bank competitors. 
 
 The potential impact of changes in monetary policy and interest rates may negatively affect our operations. 
 
 Our operating results may be significantly affected (favorably or unfavorably) by market rates of interest that, in turn, are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the United States government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies. Our earnings will depend significantly upon our interest rate spread (i.e., the difference between the interest rate earned on our loans and investments and the interest raid paid on our deposits and borrowings). Like many financial institutions, we may be subject to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, which, if significant, may have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 We cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business; increased use of technology may expose us to service interruptions or breaches in security. 
 
 The financial services market, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in: 

Telecommunications; 

Data processing; 

Automation; 

Internet-based banking, including personal computers, mobile phones and tablets; 

Debit cards and so-called smart cards 

Remote deposit capture; 

Artificial Intelligence; 

Cryptocurrency; and 

Use of Blockchain. 

Our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend, to a certain extent, on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes. We offer electronic banking services for our consumer and business clients via our website, www.cnob.com, including Internet banking and electronic bill payment, as well as mobile banking by phone. We also offer check cards, ATM cards, credit cards, and automatic and ACH transfers. The successful operation and further development of these and other new technologies will likely require additional capital investments in the future. In addition, increased use of electronic banking creates opportunities for interruptions in service or security breaches, which could expose us to claims by clients or other third parties and damage our reputation. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future, or that we will be able to maintain a secure electronic environment.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The purpose of this analysis is to provide the reader with information relevant to understanding and assessing the Company s results of operations for each of the past three years and financial condition for each of the past two years. In order to fully appreciate this analysis, the reader is encouraged to review the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing under Item 8 of this report, and statistical data presented in this document. 
 
 Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 See Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding forward-looking statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company considers the allowance for credit losses and related provision to be critical to our financial results. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1a in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses and Related Provision 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of current expected credit losses considering available information relevant to assessing collectability of cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Condition. 
 Management believes the following information may enable investors to better understand the changes in our allowance for credit losses for loans. The Company s allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 90.5 million and 78.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 11.7 million increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans was primarily driven by our collectively evaluated loans and offset by allowance for credit losses on individually analyzed loans. 
 
 The quantitative component of our allowance for credit losses on collectively evaluated loans, which is largely based on a selection of various economic forecasts, increased by 19.4 million as of December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to both organic growth of 1.4 billion in collectively evaluated loans and deterioration in periodic economic forecasts throughout the year. The qualitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on management s judgment of qualitative loss factors, was relatively unchanged, on an absolute basis, over the same period-of-time, as qualitative factor trends improved over 2022. 
 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated loans totaled 78.0 million as of December 31, 2022, which included 70.1 million of allowance related to commercial and commercial real estate loans. Included in that 70.1 million of allowance related to commercial and commercial real estate loans, 24.7 million was attributable to qualitative loss factors. Changes in managements judgement of qualitative loss factors could result in a significant change to the allowance for credit losses for loans. As described in Note 1a, to our financial statements filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, qualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the most severe loss periods identified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. As of December 31, 2022, on a weighted average basis the most severe historical loss rate for our commercial and commercial real estate loans were 2.20 and 1.85 , respectively. 

-34-

Table of Contents 

The Company s quantitative component of allowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated loans is calculated with an economic forecast sourced from Moody s. Management performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in the economic forecast as a key input on our allowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated loans. Within the various economic scenarios considered for this hypothetical sensitivity analysis, as of December 31, 2022, the quantitative estimate of the allowance for credit loss for collectively evaluated loans would increase by approximately 40 million under sole consideration of an adverse Moody s economic forecast. The hypothetical sensitivity calculation reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but lacks other qualitative overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process. As such, this does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for reasons including increases or decreases in qualitative adjustments, changes in the risk profile and size of the portfolio, changes in the severity of the macroeconomic scenario and the range of scenarios under management consideration. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses for individually analyzed loans is determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s allowance for credit losses on individually analyzed loans decreased 7.7 million from December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in individually analyzed loans, increases in charge-offs, and increases in the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans, partially offset by increases to the allowance on existing individually analyzed loans. 
 
 Overview and Strategy 
 
 We serve as a holding company for the Bank, which is our primary asset and only operating subsidiary. We follow a business plan that emphasizes the delivery of customized banking services in our market area to clients who desire a high level of personalized service and responsiveness. The Bank conducts a traditional banking business, making commercial loans, consumer loans and residential and commercial real estate loans. In addition, the Bank offers various non-deposit products through non-proprietary relationships with third party vendors. The Bank relies upon deposits as the primary funding source for its assets. The Bank offers traditional deposit products. 
 
 Many of our clients relationships start with referrals from existing clients. We then seek to cross sell our products to clients to grow the client relationship. For example, we will frequently offer an interest rate concession on credit products for clients that maintain a noninterest-bearing deposit account at the Bank. This strategy has helped maintain our funding costs and the growth of our interest expense even as we have substantially increased our total deposits. It has also helped fuel our significant loan growth. We believe that the Bank s continued growth and profitability demonstrate the need for and success of our brand of banking. 
 
 Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on funds borrowed to support those assets, primarily deposits. Net interest margin is the difference between the weighted average rate received on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid to fund those interest-earning assets, which is also affected by the average level of interest-earning assets as compared with that of interest-bearing liabilities. Net income is also affected by the amount of noninterest income and noninterest expenses. 
 
 General 
 
 The following discussion and analysis present the more significant factors affecting the Company s financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. The MD A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report.

Operating Results Overview 
 
 Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 119.2 million, a decrease of 9.5 million, or 7.4 , compared to net income of 128.6 million for 2021. Diluted earnings per share were 3.01 for 2022, a 6.5 decrease from 3.22 for 2021. 
 
 The change in net income from 2021 to 2022 was attributable to the following: 

Increased provision for credit losses of 23.2 million. The increase was primarily due to organic loan growth, as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. 

Increase in noninterest expenses of 17.4 million, primarily due to increase in salaries and employee benefits of 16.9 million attributable to increased staff in both the revenue and back-office areas of the Bank, base salary increases and incentive compensation accruals. Additionally, there were increases in acquisition expenses related to BoeFly of 1.5 million, other expenses of 1.1 million, marketing and advertising of 0.4 million, and FDIC insurance of 0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment of 1.8 million, amortization of core deposit intangibles of 0.3 million, professional and consulting of 0.2 million and information technology and communication of 0.2 million. 

Decrease in noninterest income of 2.4 million, primarily due to decreases in net gains on loans-held-for-sale of 2.1 million, gains on sales of branches of 0.7 million in 2021, decreases in net gains on sale/redemption of investment securities of 0.2 million and an increase in net losses on equity securities of 1.1 million, partially offset by increases in deposit, loan and other income of 0.9 million and income on bank owned life insurance of 0.8 million. 

Increase in income tax expense of 1.3 million resulting primarily from higher state tax rates and a slightly higher percentage of income being derived from taxable sources. 

Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 128.6 million, an increase of 57.3 million, or 80.4 , compared to net income of 71.3 million for 2020. Diluted earnings per share were 3.22 for 2021, a 79.9 increase from 1.79 for 2020. 
 
 The change in net income from 2020 to 2021 was attributable to the following: 

Decreased provision for credit losses of 46.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to the elevated provision for loan losses during 2020 due to the economic uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 pandemic. 

Increase in net interest income of 24.9 million. 

Increase in noninterest income of 1.3 million, primarily due to increases in net gains on loans-held-for-sale of 1.7 million, gain on sale of branches of 0.7 million and net gains on sale/redemption of investment securities of 0.2 million, offset by decreases in deposit, loan and other income of 0.5 million, income on bank owned life insurance of 0.2 million and net gains on equity securities of 0.6 million. The increase in net gains on loans held-for-sale resulted from mortgage loan sales, SBA loan sales and elevated commercial loan sales. The increase in gain on sale of branches was the result of the Bank selling two branches during the first quarter of 2021 related to the BNJ acquisition. 

Decrease in noninterest expenses of 12.0 million, primarily due to decreases in merger expenses of 14.6 million, change in value of acquisition price of 2.3 million, occupancy and equipment of 2.2 million, and FDIC insurance of 1.3 million, partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits of 5.5 million, other expenses of 2.6 million and professional and consulting of 0.9 million. 

Increase in income tax expense of 25.6 million resulting primarily from a higher percentage of income being derived from taxable sources. 

Net Interest Income 
 
 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2022 totaled 304.6 million, an increase of 39.9 million, or 15.1 , from 2021. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in average interest-earning assets, which grew by 14.3 to 8.3 billion and a widening of 3 basis-points in the net interest margin. The widening of the net interest margin was mainly attributable to higher yields on loans and securities and lower average cash balances, offset by a higher cost of funds. Average total loans, which includes loans held-for-sale, increased by 15.0 to 7.4 billion in 2022 from 6.4 billion in 2021. The increase in average total loans is primarily attributable to higher loan originations.

Table of Contents 

Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2021 totaled 264.7 million, an increase of 24.8 million, or 10.3 , from 2020. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in average interest-earning assets, which grew by 4.2 to 7.2 billion and a widening of 20 basis-points in the net interest margin. The widening of the net interest margin was mainly attributable to lower cost of funds, offset by higher average cash balances and lower yields on loans and securities. Average total loans, which includes loans held-for-sale, increased by 3.6 to 6.4 billion in 2021 from 6.2 billion in 2020. The increase in average total loans is primarily attributable to higher, non PPP, loan originations.

Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses 
 
 In determining the provision for credit losses, management considers national and local economic trends and conditions; trends in the portfolio including orientation to specific loan types or industries; experience, ability and depth of lending management in relation to the complexity of the portfolio; effects of changes in lending policies, trends in volume and terms of loans; levels and trends in delinquencies, impaired loans and net charge-offs and the results of independent third party loan review. 
 
 The Bank adopted CECL beginning on January 1, 2021. Provision expense may therefore become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. See Note 1b to our audited financial statements included herein. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for (reversal of) credit losses was 17.8 million, an increase of 23.3 million, compared to the provision for (reversal of) credit losses of 5.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected strong organic loan growth and changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for (reversal of) credit losses was 5.5) million, a decrease of 46.5 million, compared to the provision for (reversal of) loan losses of 41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The elevated provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the economic uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, including consideration of related borrower payment deferrals requested and or/ granted. The release of allowance for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of the continually improving macro-economic outlook during the course of 2021. 
 
 Noninterest Income 
 
 Noninterest income for the full-year 2022 decreased by 2.4 million, or 15.6 , to 13.2 million from 15.7 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in net gains on loans held for sale of 2.1 million, gains on sale of branches of 0.7 million, net gains on sale/redemption of investment securities of 0.2 million and an increase in net losses on equity securities of 1.1 million, partially offset by increases in deposit, loan and other income of 0.9 million and income on bank owned life insurance of 0.8 million.

Table of Contents 

Noninterest income for the full-year 2021 increased by 1.3 million, or 9.0 , to 15.7 million from 14.4 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases in net gains on loans held for sale of 1.7 million, gain on sale of branches of 0.7 million and net gains on sale/redemption of investment securities of 0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in deposit, loan and other income of 0.5 million, income on bank owned life insurance of 0.2 million and net gains on equity securities of 0.6 million. The increase in net gains on loans held-for-sale resulted from mortgage loan sales, SBA loan sales and elevated commercial loan sales. The increase in gain on sale of branches was the result of the Bank selling two branches during the first quarter of 2021 related to the BNJ acquisition. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 
 Noninterest expenses for the full-year 2022 increased by 17.4 million, or 15.9 , to 126.4 million from 109.0 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of 16.9 million, change in value of acquisition price of 1.5 million , other expenses of 1.1 million, marketing and advertising 0.4 million and FDIC insurance of 0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment of 1.8 million, amortization of core deposit intangible of 0.3 million, information technology and communication of 0.2 million, professional and consulting of 0.2 million and other components of net periodic pension income of 0.3 million. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was attributable to increased staff in both revenue and back-office areas of the Bank, base salary increases, and incentive compensation accruals. 
 
 Noninterest expenses for the full-year 2021 decreased by 12.0 million, or 9.9 , to 109.0 million from 121.0 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in merger expenses of 14.6 million, change in value of acquisition price of 2.3 million, occupancy and equipment of 2.2 million, and FDIC insurance of 1.3 million, partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits of 5.5 million, other expenses of 2.6 million and professional and consulting of 0.9 million. Excluding the impact on expenses related to mergers costs, expense increases were mainly attributable to increased levels of business. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense was 46.0 million for 2022 compared to 44.7 million for 2021 and 19.1 million for 2020. The increase in income tax expense in 2022 when compared to 2021 was primarily the result of higher taxable income. The increase in income tax expense in 2021 when compared to 2020 was also primarily the result of higher taxable income. The effective tax rates were 26.9 in 2022, 25.5 in 2021 and 21.1 for 2020. The higher effective tax rate during 2022 when compared to 2021 and 2020, was the result of a higher percentage of income being derived from taxable sources. The Company expects its effective tax rate to increase in 2023, as a result of the Company s revenue growth in existing and new markets.

 Asset Quality 
 
 General. One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality. When a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment, we attempt to cure the deficiency by sending late notices, as well as making personal contact with the borrower. Typically, late notices are sent approximately 10 days after the date the payment is due, followed up by direct contact with the borrower approximately 15 days after payment is due. In most cases, deficiencies are promptly resolved. If the delinquency continues, late charges are assessed, and additional efforts are made to collect the deficiency. Total loans delinquent 30 days or more are reported to the board of directors of the Bank on a monthly basis. 
 
 On loans where the collection of principal or interest payments is doubtful, the accrual of interest income ceases nonaccrual loans). Except for loans that are well-secured and in the process of collection, it is our policy to discontinue accruing additional interest and reverse any interest accrued on any loan that is 90 days or greater past due. On occasion, this action may be taken earlier if the financial condition of the borrower raises significant concern with regard to the borrower s ability to service the debt in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Interest income is not accrued on these loans until the borrower s financial condition and payment record demonstrate an ability to service the debt. Typically, a nonaccrual loan may return to accrual status if the borrower makes the loan current, and then makes six consecutive payments as scheduled. 
 
 Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned OREO until sold. OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. Costs associated with acquiring and improving a foreclosed property are usually capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed fair value less estimated selling costs. Holding costs are charged to expense. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are charged to operations, as incurred. 
 
 The Company evaluates individual instruments for expected credit losses when those instruments do not share similar risk characteristics with instruments evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. The Company evaluates the pooling methodology at least annually. Loans transition from defined segments for individual analysis when credit characteristics, or risk traits, change in a material manner. A loan is considered for individual analysis when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by the Company in determining individual analysis include payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans for which the terms have been modified as a concession to the borrower due to the borrower experiencing financial difficulties are troubled debt restructurings TDR and are individually analyzed if carrying value is 250,000 or higher. Additionally, nonaccrual loans that are 250,000 or higher are also individually analyzed. All p urchased credit-deteriorated (PCD) loans are individually analyzed. For loans designated as TDR or nonaccrual with balances less than 250,000, these loans are collectively evaluated, and, accordingly, are not separately identified for analysis or disclosures. Instruments will not be included in both collective and individual analysis. Individual analysis will establish a specific reserve for instruments in scope.

Asset Classification. Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. We have incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention. 
 
 When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, it is required that a general valuation allowance for credit losses must be established in an amount deemed prudent by management. General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100 of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. 
 
 A bank s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by Federal bank regulators which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. The Federal banking agencies have adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for credit losses. The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. Our management believes that, based on information currently available, our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level which covers all known and probable incurred losses in the portfolio at each reporting date. However, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for credit losses may become necessary.

Nonaccrual Loans, Performing Troubled Debt Restructurings, OREO and Loans 90 Days or Greater Past Due and Still Accruing 
 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and OREO. Nonaccrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been suspended. OREO represents property acquired through foreclosure in partial or full satisfaction of loans. The Company considers charging off loans, or a portion thereof, when they become contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments or when other internal or external factors indicate that collection of principal or interest is doubtful. Performing troubled debt restructurings represent loans on which a concession was granted to a borrower, such as a reduction in interest rate to a rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risks, and which are currently performing in accordance with the modified terms. Loans 90 days or greater past due and still accruing represents purchased credit-deteriorated loans, net of fair value marks, which accrete income per the valuation at date of acquisition. For additional information regarding loans, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Related Provision 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. We maintain an allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for all known and probable incurred losses in the portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of estimated losses in the portfolio, after consideration of risk characteristics of the loans and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions. Loan charge-offs (i.e., loans judged to be uncollectible) are charged against the reserve and any subsequent recovery is credited. Our officers analyze risks within the loan portfolio on a continuous basis and through an external independent loan review function, and the results of the loan review function are also reviewed by our Audit Committee. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories for each portfolio class, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves. In addition to the risk system, management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors which management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly and, as adjustments become necessary, they are recognized in the periods in which they become known. Although management strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of borrowers creditworthiness, and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies all could cause changes to our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses for loans was 90.5 million, an increase of 11.7 million, or 14.9 , from 78.8 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by an increase in general reserves, resulting primarily from organic loan growth and changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, primarily offset by releases in specific reserves. As a result of the adoption, the Bank recorded a Day 1 CECL adjustment on January 1, 2021 of 6.5 million that increased the allowance for credit losses for loans. This increase was offset by a release of provision for credit losses of 5.5 million as well as 2.0 million in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2021. The 5.5 million release of provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of a continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook during 2021. Included in the 2.0 million net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a 1.4 million charge-off of a commercial real estate loan that previously had a specific credit reserve.

 Implicit in the lending function is the fact that credit losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower and prevailing economic conditions. The allowance for credit losses has been allocated in the table below according to the estimated amount deemed to be reasonably and supportably necessary to provide for the possibility of either lifetime expected losses or losses being incurred within the following categories of loans as of December 31, for each of the past three years. 
 
 The table below shows, for three types of loans, the amounts of the allowance allocable to such loans and the percentage of such loans to gross loans, along with the amount of the unallocated allowance. Commercial loan type shown below includes commercial, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans.

Investments 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the average volume of investment securities, including equity securities, increased by 196.4 million to approximately 660.8 million or 8.0 of average earning assets, from 464.3 million, or 6.4 of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the principal components of the investment portfolio are U.S. Treasury and Government Agency Obligations, Federal Agency Obligations including mortgage-backed securities, Obligations of U.S. States and Political Subdivisions, Corporate Bonds and other debt and equity securities. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, rate related factors increased investment revenue by 4.9 million and volume related factors increased investment revenue by 5.2 million. The tax-equivalent yield on investments increased by 106 basis points to 2.67 from a yield of 1.61 during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Securities available-for-sale are a part of the Company s interest rate risk management strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, liquidity management and other factors. The Company continues to reposition the investment portfolio as part of an overall corporate-wide strategy to produce reasonable and consistent margins where feasible, while attempting to limit risks inherent in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Condition. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, net unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, which are carried as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in stockholders equity, net of tax, amounted to 61.8 million as compared with net unrealized losses of 0.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in unrealized losses is predominately attributable to changes in market conditions and interest rates. Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell, and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. This also resulted in a 25.1 million increase in deferred tax assets, attributable to the decline in fair value on securities available-for-sale since December 31, 2021. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. For additional information regarding the Company s investment portfolio, see Note 3, Note 15 and Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 During 2022 and 2021, there were no sales from the Company s available-for-sale portfolio. During 2020, there were 19.6 million in sales from the Company s available-for-sale portfolio. The Company had a 195 thousand gain on the redemption of available-for-sale securities during 2021. The gross realized gains on securities sold, called or matured amounted to 29 thousand in 2020. The Company had no impairment charges in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The table below illustrates the maturity distribution and weighted average yield on a tax-equivalent basis for amortized cost of our investment securities, excluding equity securities, as of December 31, 2022, on a contractual maturity basis.

 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 The principal objective of our asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest-rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts; determine the level of risk appropriate given our business focus, operating environment, and capital and liquidity requirements; establish prudent asset concentration guidelines; and manage the risk consistent with Board approved guidelines. We seek to reduce the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates, and actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the Bank s Asset Liability Committee (the ALCO ). The ALCO generally reviews our liquidity, cash flow needs, maturities of investments, deposits and borrowings, and current market conditions and interest rates. 
 
 We currently utilize net interest income simulation and economic value of equity EVE models to measure the potential impact to the Bank of future changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the results of the models were within guidelines prescribed by our Board of Directors. If model results were to fall outside prescribed ranges, action, including additional monitoring and reporting to the Board, would be required by the ALCO and Bank s management. 
 
 The net interest income simulation model attempts to measure the change in net interest income over the next one-year period, and over the next three-year period on a cumulative basis, assuming certain changes in the general level of interest rates. 
 
 Based on our model, which was run as of December 31, 2022, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 2.22 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 2.01 . As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous increase in the general level of interest rates would increase our net interest income by 3.35 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 5.64 . 
 
 Based on our model, which was run as of December 31, 2022, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200 basis-point instantaneous increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 2.66 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 3.99 . As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200 basis-point instantaneous increase in the general level of interest rates would increase our net interest income by 9.77 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 10.41 . 
 
 An EVE analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows with instantaneous rate shocks of up 200 basis points and down 100 basis points. The economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change. Our EVE as of December 31, 2022, would decrease by 10.51 with an instantaneous rate shock of up 200 basis points, and decrease by 1.13 with an instantaneous rate shock of down 100 basis points. Our EVE as of December 31, 2021, would increase by 0.24 with an instantaneous rate shock of up 200 basis points, and decline by 5.20 with an instantaneous rate shock of down 100 basis points.

Estimates of Fair Value 
 
 The estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets of the Company, including available-for-sale investment securities. These are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors. Circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds, expected cash flows, credit quality, discount rates, or market interest rates. Fair values for most available-for-sale investment securities are based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic condition risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 
 
 These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the operations; unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of a bank s ability to fund loans, withdrawals or maturities of deposits, and other cash outflows in a cost-effective manner. Our principal sources of funds are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities of investment securities, and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that, on a short and long-term basis, contractual liabilities, depositors withdrawal requirements, and other operational and client credit needs could be satisfied. As of December 31, 2022, liquid assets (cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and unencumbered investment securities) were 760.0 million, which represented 7.9 of total assets and 9.3 of total deposits and borrowings, compared to 742.1 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented 9.1 of total assets and 10.9 of total deposits and borrowings on such date.

Capital 
 
 The maintenance of a solid capital foundation continues to be a primary goal for the Company. Accordingly, capital plans, stock repurchases, and dividend policies are monitored on an ongoing basis. The most important objective of the capital planning process is to balance effectively the retention of capital to support future growth and the goal of providing stockholders with an attractive long-term return on their investment. 
 
 The Company s Tier 1 leverage capital (defined as tangible stockholders equity for common stock and Trust Preferred Capital Securities) as of December 31, 2022 amounted to 1.0 billion or 10.7 of average total assets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company s Tier 1 leverage capital amounted to 909.6 million or 11.7 of average total assets. The increase in Tier 1 capital reflects the Company s retained earnings during 2022. 
 
 United States bank regulators have issued guidelines establishing minimum capital standards related to the level of assets and off balance-sheet exposures adjusted for credit risk. Specifically, these guidelines categorize assets and off balance-sheet items into risk-weightings and require banking institutions to maintain a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s CET 1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 10.30 , 11.66 and 14.45 , respectively. For information on risk-based capital and regulatory guidelines for the Parent Corporation and its bank subsidiary, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the bank regulators regarding capital components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 
 Subordinated Debentures 
 
 During December 2003, Center Bancorp Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Corporation issued 5.0 million of MMCapS capital securities to investors due on January 23, 2034. The trust loaned the proceeds of this offering to the Company and received in exchange 5.2 million of the Parent Corporation s subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or part. The floating interest rate on the subordinated debentures is three-month LIBOR plus 2.85 and re-prices quarterly. The rate as of December 31, 2022 was 7.26 . 
 
 During June 2020, the Parent Corporation issued 75 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the 2020 Notes ). The 2020 Notes bear interest at 5.75 annually from, and including, the date of initial issuance to, but excluding, September 15, 2025 or the date of earlier redemption, payable semi-annually in arrears on September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2020. From and including September 15, 2025 through maturity or earlier redemption, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be Three-Month Term SOFR (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture), plus 560.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the benchmark rate is less than zero, then the benchmark rate shall be deemed to be zero. 
 
 During January 2018, the Parent Corporation issued 75 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the Notes to certain accredited investors. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used in the first quarter of 2018 for general corporate purposes, which included the Parent Corporation contributing 65 million of the net proceeds to the Bank in the form of debt and common equity. The Notes were non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of February 1, 2028 and bear interest at a rate that resets quarterly to then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 284 basis points. The 2018 Notes were redeemed in full on February 1, 2023. 
 
 During June 2015, the Parent Corporation issued 50 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the 2015 Notes ). As of December 31, 2020, the 2015 Notes had a stated maturity of July 1, 2025, and bore interest until the maturity date or early redemption date at a variable rate equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 393 basis points. As of December 31, 2020, the variable interest rate was 4.16 , all costs related to 2015 issuance had been amortized and the 2015 Notes were redeemed in full on January 1, 2021.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PCAOB ID 
 
 Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 Explanatory Paragraph Change in Accounting Principle 
 
 As discussed in Note 1a to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2021 due to the adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Qualitative Loss Factors on Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 
 As described in Note 1a to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. ASC 326 requires the measurement of expected lifetime credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost at the reporting date. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans was 90,513,000. 
 
 Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on pooled loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors includes pooling loans into portfolio segments for loan that share similar characteristics. Pooled loan portfolio segments include commercial, commercial real estate, commercial construction, residential real estate, and consumer loans. 
 
 For pooled loans, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow DCF methodology to estimate credit losses over the expected life of the loan. The DCF methodology combines probability of default, the loss given default, and prepayment speed assumptions to estimate a reserve for each loan. The quantitative loss rates are adjusted by macroeconomic scenarios and reverts, on a straight-line basis, to average historical losses after the forecasted periods. The sum of all the loan level reserves is aggregated for each portfolio segment and a quantitative loss factor is derived. The quantitative factors are also supplemented by certain qualitative loss factors reflecting management s view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. Qualitative loss factors, for each loan segment within the portfolio, incorporate consideration for a minimum to maximum range for qualitative loss factor derived from either the Company s historical loss experience or peer group historical loss experience. Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the Company s financial results. 
 
 We identified auditing the qualitative component of the ACL on pooled loans in the commercial and commercial real estate loan segments as a critical audit matter because the methodology to determine the estimate of credit losses uses subjective judgments by management and is subject to material variability. 
 
 Performing audit procedures to evaluate the qualitative loss factors on the commercial and commercial real estate loan segments involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the need to involve more experienced audit personnel including the use of internal specialists.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Testing the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the ACL on pooled loans, including controls addressing: 
 
 o Methodology and accounting policies. 

o Data inputs, judgments and calculations used to determine the qualitative loss factors. 

o Information technology general controls and application controls. 

o Management s evaluation of qualitative loss factors. 

Substantively testing management s process, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions, for developing the ACL on pooled loans, which included: 
 
 o Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company s accounting policies, judgments and elections. 

o Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. 

o Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation including utilizing internal specialists to assist in testing the mathematical accuracy of the underlying peer data used to develop the maximum loss factors. 

o Evaluating the reasonableness of management s judgments related to qualitative loss factors to determine if they are calculated to conform with management s policies and were consistently applied period over period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021. The announcement also indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, although banks have continued to submit certain rates for the calculation of LIBOR in 2022, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the LIBOR administrator . Similarly, banking regulators in the United States have required insured depository institutions in the United States to cease originating loans using LIBOR as a rate index as of December 31, 2021, and in March 2022 Congress adopted legislation providing for the replacement of LIBOR indexes in contracts without fall back language with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), and for the Federal Reserve to adopt regulation by September of 2022 implementing this change. Although the Bank ceased using LIBOR as an index for loans it originates, it is unclear at this time what effect these changes may have on the values of loans and liabilities held or owed by the Bank whose interest rates are or were tied to LIBOR. Uncertainty surrounding the phase out of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our loans, and our investment securities. 
 
 The United States economy is currently experiencing a level of price inflation not experienced since the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. It is therefore difficult to predict the response of consumers and businesses to this level of inflation, and its impact on the economy. In addition, in order to attempt to control and reduce the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a series of interest rate increases along with quantitative tightening to further constrict economic conditions. It is unclear whether the Federal Reserve s efforts will be successful, and what impact they may have on the United States economy. It is possible that the combined effects of inflation and increases in market interest rates could cause the economy of the United States to enter a recession, which could negatively affect the businesses of our borrowers and their ability to repay their loans or need credit, which could negatively affect our results of operations. 

For available-for-sale investment securities which are in an unrealized loss position, the Company will first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not, that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria is met, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale investment securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from an actual or estimated credit loss event or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss is likely, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company elected the practical expedient of zero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. 
 
 Prior to January 1, 2021, securities were evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. FASB ASC 320 - 10 - 65 clarifies the interaction of the factors that were considered when determining whether a debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired. For debt securities, management assessed whether (a) it has the intent to sell the security and (b) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery. These steps were done before assessing whether the entity will recover the cost basis of the investment. In instances when a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists but the investor does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery, FASB ASC 320 - 10 - 65 changed the presentation and amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The other-than-temporary impairment was separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit loss) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss was recognized through earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors was recognized through other comprehensive income. 
 
 segments of loans: commercial, commercial real estate, commercial construction, residential real estate (including home equity) and consumer. 

Loans that are days past due are placed on nonaccrual and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income unless the loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In certain cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for credit losses and loans individually evaluated for credit losses. 
 
 All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 
 The policy of the Company is to generally grant commercial, residential and consumer loans to residents and businesses within the market-areas served by its offices in New Jersey, New York and Florida. The borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the borrowers underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the lender s lien on the property. Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the control of the Company. The Company is therefore subject to risk of loss. The Company believes its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for credit losses are provided for all known and inherent risks. Collateral and/or personal guarantees are required for a large majority of the Company s loans. 

Expected credit losses of financial assets are measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristic(s) exist. If the Company determines that a financial asset does not share risk characteristics with other financial assets, the Company will evaluate the financial asset for expected credit losses on an individual basis. Financial assets are assessed once, either through collective assessments or individual assessments. Standard expected losses are evaluated on a collective, or pool, basis when financial assets share similar risk characteristics. For pooled loan segments, utilizing a quantitative analysis, the Company calculates estimated credit losses using a probability of default and loss given default methodology, the results of which are applied to the aggregated discounted cash flow of each individual loan within the segment. In the absence of relevant and reliable internal data, probability of default and loss given default rates are determined using peer data. The point in time probability of default and loss given default are then conditioned by macroeconomic scenarios to incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Financial assets may be segmented based on one characteristic, or a combination of characteristics. Examples of risk characteristics relevant to the Company s evaluation included, but were not limited to: 1 Internal or external credit scores or credit ratings, 2 Risk ratings or classifications, 3 Financial asset type, 4 Collateral type, 5 Size, 6 Effective interest rate, 7 Term, 8 Geographical location, 9 Industry of the borrower and 10 Vintage. 
 
 The Company s quantitative analysis also considers relevant available information from internal and external sources related to past events and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company evaluates a variety of factors including third party economic forecasts, industry trends and other available published economic information in arriving at its forecasts. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis, to average historical losses. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. 
 
 Included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Each qualitative loss factor, for each loan segment within the portfolio, incorporates consideration for a minimum to maximum range for loss factors derived from either the Company s historical loss experience, or peer group historical charge-off experience. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease the Company s estimate of expected credit losses and are applied to each loan segment. 
 
 The Bank evaluates individual instruments for expected credit losses when those instruments do not share similar risk characteristics with instruments evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. The Company evaluates the pooling methodology at least annually. Loans transition from defined segments for individual analysis when credit characteristics, or risk traits, change in a material manner. A loan is considered for individual analysis when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by the Company in determining individual analysis include payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments, when due. 
 
 Loans for which the terms have been modified as a concession to the borrower due to the borrower experiencing financial difficulties are troubled debt restructurings TDR and are individually analyzed if carrying value is or higher. Additionally, nonaccrual loans that are or higher are also individually analyzed. All PCD loans are individually analyzed. For loans designated as TDR or nonaccrual with balances less than , these loans are collectively evaluated, and, accordingly, are not separately identified for analysis or disclosures. Instruments will not be included in both collective and individual analysis. Individual analysis will establish a specific reserve for instruments in scope. 
 
 For collateral dependent loans, when it is determined that a foreclosure is probable, the allowance for credit losses is determined on a loan level basis using the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated disposition costs net fair value ), which will ensure that the credit loss is not delayed until the time at which the actual foreclosure takes place. In the event that this fair value is less than then amortized cost basis of these specific loans, the Company will recognize the difference between the net fair value at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis in the allowance for credit losses. If the fair value of the collateral has increased as of the evaluation date, the increase in the fair value of the collateral is reflected through a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. Adjustments for estimated disposition costs are not appropriate when the repayment of a collateral-dependent loan is expected from the operation of the collateral. If repayment is based upon future expected cash flows, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate is compared to the carrying value of the loan, and any shortfall is recorded as the allowance for credit losses. The effective interest rate used to discount expected cash flows is adjusted to incorporate expected prepayments, if applicable. 

to years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the terms of the respective leases, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from to years. 

The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with FASB ASC 715 - 30. FASB ASC 715 - 30 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the Company s statement of financial condition and changes in the funded status be reflected in other comprehensive income. FASB ASC 715 - 30 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year-end. 
 
 The Company maintains a 401 (k)-employee savings plan to provide for defined contributions which covers substantially all employees of the Company. Employee 401 (k) and profit-sharing plan expense is the amount of matching contributions.

On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016 - 13 and implemented the CECL methodology for allowance for credit losses on its investment securities available-for-sale. The new CECL methodology replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model that previously existed. The Company did not have a CECL day 1 impact attributable to its investment securities portfolio and did not have an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 . The Company has elected to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost of its investment securities available-for-sale. Accrued interest receivable for investment securities available for sale as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , totaled million and million, respectively. 

Note 3 Investment Securities (continued) 
 
 The Company evaluates securities in an unrealized loss position for impairment related to credit losses on at least a quarterly basis. Securities in unrealized loss positions are first assessed as to whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If one of the criteria is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through current earnings. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on asset backed securities and state and municipal securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities was recorded as of December 31, 2022 . 
 
 Federal agency obligations, residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities and commercial mortgage-backed pass-through securities are issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Although a government guarantee exists on these investments, these entities are not legally backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, and the current support they receive is subject to a cap as part of the agreement entered into in 2008. Nonetheless, at this time we do not foresee any set of circumstances in which the government would not fund its commitments on these investments as the issuers are an integral part of the U.S. housing market in providing liquidity and stability. Therefore, we concluded that a zero -allowance approach for these investment securities is appropriate.

1 Included in commercial loans as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans of million and million, respectively. These loans are 100 federally guaranteed and currently not subject to any allocation of allowance for credit losses. 

As of December 31, 2022 , and 2021 , loan balances of approximately billion and billion, respectively, were pledged to secure borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. 
 
 The loan segments in the above table have unique risk characteristics with respect to credit quality: 
 
 The repayment of commercial loans is generally dependent on the creditworthiness and cash flow of borrowers, and if applicable, guarantors, which may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions. While the majority of these loans are secured, collateral type, marketing, coverage, valuation and monitoring is not as uniform as in other portfolio classes and recovery from liquidation of such collateral may be subject to greater variability. 
 
 Payment on commercial real estate is driven principally by operating results of the managed properties or underlying business and secondarily by the sale or refinance of such properties. Both primary and secondary sources of repayment, and value of the properties in liquidation, may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. 
 
 Properties underlying construction, land and land development loans often do not generate sufficient cash flows to service debt and thus repayment is subject to ability of the borrower and, if applicable, guarantors, to complete development or construction of the property and carry the project, often for extended periods of time. As a result, the performance of these loans is contingent upon future events whose probability at the time of origination is uncertain. 
 
 The ability of borrowers to service debt in the residential and consumer loan portfolios is generally subject to personal income which may be impacted by general economic conditions, such as increased unemployment levels. These loans are predominately collateralized by first and/or second liens on single family properties. If a borrower cannot maintain the loan, the Company s ability to recover against the collateral in sufficient amount and in a timely manner may be significantly influenced by market, legal and regulatory conditions. 
 
 The Company considers loan classes and loan segments to be one and the same.

Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and loans individually evaluated for impairment. 

Credit Quality Indicators - The Company continuously monitors the credit quality of its loans receivable. In addition to its internal monitoring, the Company utilizes the services of a third -party loan review firm to periodically validate the credit quality of its loans receivable on a sample basis. Credit quality is monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators. Assets classified as Pass are deemed to possess average to superior credit quality, requiring no more than normal attention. Assets classified as Special Mention have generally acceptable credit quality yet possess higher risk characteristics/circumstances than satisfactory assets. Such conditions include strained liquidity, slow pay, stale financial statements, or other conditions that require more stringent attention from the lending staff. These conditions, if not corrected, may weaken the loan quality or inadequately protect the Company s credit position at some future date. Assets are classified as Substandard if the asset has a well-defined weakness that requires management s attention to a greater degree than for loans classified as special mention. Such weakness, if left uncorrected, could possibly result in the compromised ability of the loan to perform to contractual requirements. An asset is classified as Doubtful if it is inadequately protected by the net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any, that secures the obligation. Assets classified as doubtful include assets for which there is a distinct possibility that a degree of loss will occur if the inadequacies are not corrected. 

We evaluate whether a modification, extension or renewal of a loan is a current period origination in accordance with GAAP. Generally, loans up for renewal are subject to a full credit evaluation before the renewal is granted and such loans are considered current period originations for purpose of the table below.

On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss method we used in prior periods for determining the provision for credit losses and the allowance for credit losses. Under CECL, we record an expected loss of all cash flows we do not expect to collect at the inception of the loan. The adoption of CECL resulted in an increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans of million, which did not impact our consolidated income statement.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 
 Loans are considered to have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring TDR when, except as discussed below, due to a borrower s financial difficulties, the Company makes certain concessions to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Modifications may include interest rate reductions, maturity extensions, principal or interest forgiveness, forbearance, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that has been modified in a TDR remains on nonaccrual status for a period of nine months to demonstrate that the borrower is able to meet the terms of the modified loan. However, performance prior to the modification, or significant events that coincide with the modification, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time of loan modification or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains on nonaccrual status. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , there were commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans were on nonaccrual status or were contractually past due 90 days or greater and still accruing interest, or whose terms have been modified in a TDR. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, TDRs totaled million, of which million were on nonaccrual status and million were classified as accruing and were performing under their restructured terms. As of December 31, 2021, TDRs totaled million, of which million were on nonaccrual status and million were classified as accruing and were performing under their restructured terms. The Company has allocated million and million of specific allowance related to TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. There were TDRs for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 Income tax expense 

On July 1, 2018 New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed Assembly Bill 4202 the Bill into law. The legislation imposes a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of 1 million of 2.5 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. However, in 2020, this surtax was extended through December 31, 2023, at the 2.5 level. The legislation also requires combined filing for members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, changing New Jersey s current status as a separate return state, and limits the deductibility of dividends received.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. During 2022 and 2021, based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. There are unrecorded tax benefits, and the Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits to significantly increase in the next twelve months. 
 
 The Company s federal income tax returns are open and subject to examination from the tax return year and forward. The Company s state income tax returns are generally open from the 2018 and later tax return years based on individual state statutes of limitations.

The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost for the following three years: 

Expected long-term return on plan assets 
 Rate of compensation increase N/A N/A N/A 

The process of determining the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets begins with a review of appropriate investment data, including current yields on fixed income securities, historical investment data, historical plan performance and forecasts of inflation and future total returns for the various asset classes. This data forms the basis for the construction of a best-estimate range of real investment returns for each asset class. An average weighted real-return range is computed reflecting the plan s expected asset mix, and that range, when combined with an expected inflation range, produces an overall best-estimate expected return range. Specific factors such as the plan s investment policy, reinvestment risk and investment volatility are taken into consideration during the construction of the best estimate real return range, as well as in the selection of the final return assumption from within the range. 
 
 Plan Assets 
 
 The general investment policy of the Pension Trust is for the fund to experience growth in assets that will allow the market value to exceed the value of benefit obligations over time.

Fair Value of Plan Assets 
 
 The Company used the following valuation methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of assets held by the plan (for further information on fair value methods, see Note 20 ): 
 
 Equity securities and real estate funds : The fair values for equity securities and real estate funds are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1 ). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2 ). 

Note 16 Pension and Other Benefits (continued) 
 
 Debt and fixed income securities : Certain debt securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the bond is traded (Level 1 inputs). Other debt securities are valued based upon recent bid prices or the average of recent bid and asked prices when available (Level 2 inputs) and, if not available, they are valued through matrix pricing models developed by sources considered by management to be reliable. Matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded, values debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3 ). Discounted cash flows are calculated using spread to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate loss severities, volatility, credit spread and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations. 
 
 The investment manager is not authorized to purchase, acquire or otherwise hold certain types of market securities (subordinated bonds, real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, naked puts, naked calls, stock index futures, oil, gas or mineral exploration ventures or unregistered securities) or to employ certain types of market techniques (margin purchases or short sales) or to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, or in any manner transfer as security for indebtedness, any security owned or held by the Plan.

2024 
 2025 
 2026

401 (k) Plan 
 
 The Company maintains a 401 (k) plan to provide for defined contributions which covers substantially all employees of the Company. Beginning with the 2014 plan year, the 401 (k) plan was amended to provide for a match of of elective contributions, up to 6 of an employee s contribution. In 2018, the 401 (k) plan was amended to provide for matching of employee contributions up to 5 of employee contributions. For 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , employer contributions amounted to million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP 
 
 During 2019 and in 2021, the Company adopted supplemental executive retirement plans SERP s for the benefit of several of its executive officers. Each SERP is a non-qualified plan which provides supplemental retirement benefits to the participating officers of the Company. SERP compensation expense was million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

. Grants under the Plan can be in the form of stock options (qualified or non-qualified), restricted shares, restricted share units or performance units. Shares available for grant and issuance under the Plan as of December 31, 2022 are approximately . The Company intends to issue all shares under the Plan in the form of newly issued shares. 
 
 Restricted stock, options and deferred stock units typically have a three -year vesting period starting one year after the date of grant with one - third vesting each year. The options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to new employees and board members may be granted with shorter vesting periods. Grants of performance units typically have a cliff vesting after three years or upon a change of control. All issuances are subject to forfeiture if the recipient leaves or is terminated prior to the awards vesting. Restricted shares have the same dividend and voting rights as common stock, while options, performance units and deferred stock units do not. 
 
 All awards are issued at the fair value of the underlying shares at the grant date. The Company expenses the cost of the awards, which is determined to be the fair market value of the awards at the date of grant, ratably over the vesting period. Forfeiture rates are not estimated but are recorded as incurred. Stock-based compensation expense was million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. 

Activity under the Company s options for the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:

 Forfeited/cancelled/expired 
 Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 
 
 Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 - 

Note 17 Stock Based Compensation - (continued) 
 
 The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable options above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company s closing stock price on December 31, 2022 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2022 . This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company s stock. 
 
 Activity under the Company s restricted shares for year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: 

Granted 
 Vested 
 Forfeited/cancelled/expired 
 Nonvested December 31, 2022 

Note 17 Stock Based Compensation (continued) 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted shares granted. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 A summary of the status of unearned performance unit awards and the change during the period is presented in the table below: 

Awarded 
 Vested shares 
 Unearned as of December 31, 2022 

As of December 31, 2022, the specific number of shares related to performance units that were expected to vest was , determined by actual performance in consideration of the established range of the performance targets, which is consistent with the level of expense currently being recognized over the vesting period. Should this expectation change, additional compensation expense could be recorded in future periods or previously recognized expense could be reversed. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of performance units that ultimately could vest if performance targets were exceeded is . During the year ended December 31, 2022, shares vested. A total of shares were netted from the vested shares to satisfy employee tax obligations. The net shares issued from vesting of performance units during the year ended December 31, 2022 were shares. As of December 31, 2022, compensation cost of approximately million related to non-vested performance units not yet recognized is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

Any forfeitures would result in previously recognized expense being reversed. A portion of the shares that vest will be netted out to satisfy the tax obligations of the recipient. During the year ended December 31, 2022, shares vested. A total of shares were netted from the vested shares to satisfy employee tax obligations. The net shares issued from vesting of deferred stock units during the year ended December 31, 2022 were shares. As of December 31, 2022, compensation cost of approximately million related to non-vested deferred stock units, not yet recognized, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 

million was available for payment of dividends based on regulatory guidelines. 

pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps, with a total notional amount of million, all of which were entered into in 2021 and 2022. These are designated as cash flow hedges of current, Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We are required to pay fixed rates of interest ranging from to and receive variable rates of interest that reset quarterly based on the daily compounding secured overnight financing rate SOFR ). All swaps carry expiration dates on the eleven positions ranging from December 2025 to March 2028 . The swaps are determined to be fully effective during the period presented and therefore no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swap is recorded in other assets (liabilities) with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to current earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully effective during the remaining term of the swaps. 
 
 The Company previously entered into forward starting interest rate cap spread transaction, with a total notional amount of million, which became effective on October 1, 2022 and matures in October of 2027 and one additional interest rate cap spread transaction, with a total notional amount of million, which became effective in November 2022 and matures in November of 2027 . These are designated as cash flow hedges of brokered certificates of deposits, and the interest rate cap spread is indexed to a benchmark of fed funds with payment required on a monthly basis. The structure of these instruments is such that the Company entered into a total of 225 million in notional amount of sold interest rate cap agreements, in which we are required to pay the counterparty an incremental amount if the index rate exceeds a set cap rate. Simultaneously, the Company purchased a total of 225 million notional amount of interest rate cap agreements in which we receive an incremental amount if the index rate is above a set cap rate. No payments are required if the index rate is at, or below, the cap rate on the sold or purchased interest rate cap agreements. 
 
 Interest expense recorded on these swap and cap transactions totaled approximately 3.3 million, million, and ) million during 2022, 2021, and 2020 is reported as a component of either interest expense on FHLB Advances and brokered certificates of deposits.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 
 The Company may be required periodically to measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 : 

Collateral Dependent Loans: The Company may record adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements, either as specific reserves or as partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of these loans. These adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral dependent loans calculated in accordance with GAAP. Impairment amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated impairment amount applicable to that loan does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is valued using independent appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable by market participants. However, due to the substantial judgment applied and limited volume of activity as compared to other assets, fair value is based on Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair value used for collateral supporting commercial loans generally are based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace and are also based on Level 3 inputs. 
 
 For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: 

Commercial real estate 
 Residential real estate 

Commercial real estate

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 FASB ASC 825 - 10 requires all entities to disclose the estimated fair value of their financial instrument assets and liabilities. For the Company, as for most financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments as defined in FASB ASC 825 - 10. Many of the Company s financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. It is also the Company s general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments to maturity and not to engage in trading or sales activities except for loans held-for-sale and investment securities available-for-sale. Therefore, significant estimations and assumptions, as well as present value calculations, were used by the Company for the purposes of this disclosure. 
 
 Fair values for financial instruments must be estimated by management using techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and comparison to similar instruments. These estimates are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. Changes in these judgments often have a material effect on the fair value estimates. Since these estimates are made as of a specific point in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes. Fair values disclosed in accordance with ASC Topic 825 do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from the sale of a large volume of a particular financial instrument, nor do they reflect possible tax ramifications or estimated transaction costs. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values. 
 
 FHLB stock. It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. 
 
 Loans. The fair value of portfolio loans, net is determined using an exit price methodology. The exit price methodology continues to be based on a discounted cash flow analysis, in which projected cash flows are based on contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayments for certain loan types e.g., residential mortgage loans and multi-family loans) and the use of a discount rate based on expected relative risk of the cash flows. The discount rate selected considers loan type, maturity date, a liquidity premium, cost to service, and cost of capital, which is a Level 3 fair value estimate. 
 
 Deposits. The carrying amounts of deposits with no stated maturities (i.e., non interest-bearing, savings, NOW, and money market deposits) are assigned fair values equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair value of time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows using estimated rates currently offered for alternative funding sources of similar remaining maturity. 
 
 Term Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures . The fair value of the Company s long-term borrowings and subordinated debentures were calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and applying discount rates currently offered based on weighted remaining maturities. 
 
 Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a level 2 or level 3 classification based on the level of the asset or liability with which the accrual is associated. 

The following presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 :

The fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, considering the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of letters of credit and lines of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. The fair value of commitments to originate loans is immaterial and not included in the tables above. 
 
 Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on these estimated fair values. 
 
 The Company s remaining assets and liabilities, which are not considered financial instruments, have not been valued differently than has been customary with historical cost accounting. No disclosure of the relationship value of the Company s core deposit base is required by FASB ASC 825 - 10. 
 
 Fair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, there are certain significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities, such as the brokerage network, deferred taxes, premises and equipment, and goodwill. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. 
 
 Management believes that reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely, due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made, given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
 
 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management, Board of Directors and shareholders regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
