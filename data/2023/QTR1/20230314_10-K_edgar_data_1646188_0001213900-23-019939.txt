Risk Factor Summary 

Our
business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors 
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of these principal risks include the following: 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

We have incurred significant
 operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability. 

The Company operates in
 evolving markets, which makes it difficult to evaluate the Company s business and future prospects. 

Failure to manage our planned
 growth could place a significant strain on our resources. 

If we fail to retain our
 existing customers or do not acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial
 condition or results of operations may be harmed. 

Our contractors may fail
 to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these relationships, either of which may have
 a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Material delays or defaults
 in customer payments could leave us unable to cover expenditures related to such customer s projects, including the payment
 of our subcontractors. 

Warranty claims resulting
 from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our marketing efforts depend
 significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing customers. 

Our technology, products
 and services have only been developed in the last several years and we have had only limited opportunities to deploy and assess their
 performance in the field at full scale. 

We expect to incur substantial research and development costs and devote significant resources to identifying and commercializing new products and services, which could significantly reduce our profitability and may never result in revenue to us. 

If our products do not interoperate with our customers other systems, the purchase or deployment of our products and services may be delayed or cancelled. 

Cyberattacks through security vulnerabilities could lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. 

If the Company is required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company s financial condition and results could be negatively affected. 

We may not be able to secure adequate insurance policies, or secure insurance policies at reasonable prices. 

Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our products have inherent safety risks, as they often operate in hazardous industrial environments and are relied on by our customers to operate in a safe manner. If the reliability of our products fails to meet expected levels during commercial operation, this could result property damage, injury, death, financial harm to the business, and/or brand harm to the business. 

Risks
Related to Regulatory Requirements 

We and our customers operate
 in a highly regulated business environment and changes in regulation could impose costs on us or make our products less economical. 

Failure to obtain necessary
 regulatory approvals from the FAA or other governmental agencies, or limitations put on the use of small UAS in response to public
 privacy and other concerns, may prevent us from expanding the sales of our drone solutions to industrial and government customers
 in the United States. 

Substantially all our current
 products depend on the availability and are subject to the use of licensed radio frequencies regulated by the FCC in the United States. 

As
 a manufacturer of commercial UAS, we are subject to various government regulations, restrictions and requirements, and may be
 subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm, restrict
 or add costs to our business. 

Risks

Our ability to protect
 our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain. 

Our business may suffer
 if it is alleged or found that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. 

Intellectual property rights
 do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 

Risks
Related to our Financial Results 

We will need to generate
 significant sales to achieve profitable operations. 

Our future profitability
 may be dependent upon achieving cost reductions and projected economies of scale from increasing manufacturing quantities of our
 products. Failing to achieve such reductions in manufacturing costs and projected economies of scale could materially adversely affect
 our business. 

We
 previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with the inadequate review
 of stock-based compensation issued in connection with the acquisition of American Robotics, which has since been remediated,
 and we may identify material weaknesses in the future. 

Following
the completion of the acquisition of Airobotics, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increased. 

Risks Related to the Airobotics Transaction 

Our business relationships,
 those of Airobotics or the combined company may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition of Airobotics
 (the Airobotics Transaction ). 

Ondas may experience difficulties
 integrating Airobotics business. 

The
combined company may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Airobotics Transaction within the timing anticipated or at all. 

The Airobotics Robotics
 Transaction involved substantial costs. 

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

Concentration of ownership
 of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing
 significant corporate decisions. 

We may issue more shares
 to raise additional capital, which may result in substantial dilution. 

ii 

Item
1. Business. 

This
business description should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Form 10-K ), which
are incorporated herein by this reference. 

The
use of the words we, our, the Company and Ondas Holdings in this Form 10-K refer
to Ondas Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

Corporate
Overview 

Ondas
Holdings Inc. is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its wholly owned subsidiaries Ondas
Networks Inc. Ondas Networks ), American Robotics, Inc. American Robotics or AR and Airobotics,
Ltd. Airobotics ). 

Ondas
Holdings acquired American Robotics, a leading developer of highly automated commercial drone systems on August 5, 2021. 

Ondas
Holdings acquired Airobotics, an Israeli-based developer of autonomous drone systems on January 23, 2023. 

American
Robotics and Airobotics are operated together, under a separate business unit called Ondas Autonomous Systems. Ondas Networks and Ondas
Autonomous Systems together provide users in rail, energy, mining, agriculture, public safety and critical infrastructure and government
markets with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate
Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems as separate business segments. See Note 1 and Note 2 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding our segments. 

Ondas
Networks 

Ondas
Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to
these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things MC-IoT ). Our wireless networking products are applicable
to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications
require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such
applications are required in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and
public safety, homeland security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve
efficiency and ensure a high degree of safety and security. 

1 

We
design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio SDR platform for secure,
licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area
network infrastructure. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE ),
the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16s standard. Because standards-based
communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we have taken a leadership position
in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports
the adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets. 

Our
software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks,
leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure
customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy
serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data
throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting
next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing
power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which
can be supported by the Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes
management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more
reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge. 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems 

Our
Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit designs, develops, and markets commercial drone solutions via the Optimus System and Scout
System (the Autonomous Drone Platforms ). 

The
Autonomous Drone Platforms are highly automated, AI-powered drone systems capable of continuous, remote operation and are marketed as
 drone-in-a-box turnkey data solution services. They are deployed for critical industrial and government applications where
data and information collection and processing are required. These use cases include public safety, security and smart city deployments
where routine, high-resolution automated emergency response, mapping, surveying, and inspection services are highly valued, in addition
to industrial markets such as oil gas, rail and ports which emphasize security and inspection solutions. The Autonomous Drone Platforms
are typically provided to customers under a Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model, while some customers will choose to purchase and
own and operate an Optimus Systems . 

American
Robotics and Airobotics have industry leading regulatory successes which include having the first drone system approved by the Federal
Aviation Administration FAA for automated operation beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. 

In
addition to the Autonomous Drone Platforms, we also offer a counter-drone system called the Raider . The Raider was developed by
Iron Drone and is deployed by government and enterprise customers to provide security and protect critical infrastructure, assets and
people from the threat of hostile drones. Ondas Holdings acquired Iron Drone on March 6, 2023. 

Autonomous
Drone Platforms 

We design, develop and manufacture autonomous drone systems, providing
high-fidelity, ultra-high-resolution aerial data to enterprise and government customers. We currently prioritize the marketing of our
Optimus System which provides customers with a turnkey data and information solution and the ability to continuously digitize,
analyze, and monitor their assets and field operations in real-time or near real-time. We believe the market opportunity for our Scout
System remains significant. As we drive market adoption with the Optimus platform, we anticipate re-introducing the Scout platform
including newly enhanced versions to help segment the market for different use cases and price points. 

The
Optimus System has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the
real world. Powered by innovations in robotics automation, machine vision, edge computing, and AI. Once installed in the field at customer
locations, a fleet of connected Optimus Systems , which are often deployed as networked drone infrastructure, which we refer to
as Urban Drone Infrastructure, remains indefinitely positioned in an area of operation, automatically collecting and seamlessly delivering
data and information regularly and reliably. 

2 

We
market the Optimus System under a DaaS business model, whereby our drone platform aggregates customer data and provides the data
analytics meeting customer requirements in return for an annual subscription fee. Some customers purchase Optimus Systems to own
and operate themselves. We also engage distributors to assist in the sales and marketing of our Optimus System in geographic markets
where its more cost effective to identify and service potential customers by engaging local third parties. These distribution agreements
can include joint ventures, where Ondas Autonomous Systems will provide technical expertise to support the joint venture partner in the
provision of aerial data services to customers. 

The
Optimus System consists of (i) Optimus , a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads, (ii) the Airbase ,
a ruggedized weatherproof base station for housing, battery swapping, battery charging, payload swapping, data processing, and cloud
transfer, and (iii) Insightful , a secure web portal and API which enables remote interaction with the system, data, and resulting
analytics anywhere in the world. These major subsystems are connected via a host of supporting technologies. Airbase has internal
robotic systems that enable the automated swapping of batteries and payloads. Automated battery swapping allows for 24/7 operation of
Optimus as the Optimus drone can immediately be redeployed after returning to the dock for a battery swap. Similarly, the ability to
autonomously swap sensors and advanced payloads without human intervention allows for the Optimus System to provide multiple applications
and use cases from a single location. 

American
Robotics and Airobotics have industry leading regulatory successes which include having the first drone system approved by the FAA for
automated operation BVLOS without a human operator or visual observer on-site. American Robotics FAA approvals were enabled by
integrating a suite of proprietary technologies, including Detect-and-Avoid DAA and other proprietary intelligent safety
systems into its autonomous drone platform, which we plan to integrate into the Optimus System . Airobotics is in the advanced
stages of receiving approval for Type Certification TC from the FAA for the Optimus UAV. TC approval will enable expanded
operation for the Optimus System in the United States including flight operations in populated areas. 

The
Raider 

The
Raider is a counter-drone system, which was designed and developed by Iron Drone, that we are marketing to government and enterprise
customers who can utilize the system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of
hostile drones. A typical Raider deployment location would include sensitive locations such as borders, stadiums or schools, or
near critical assets such as power plants and military bases, and for high profile locations such as amusement parks or where public
events are held. 

The
Raider is designed to detect, track and intercept unauthorized, or hostile unmanned aircraft and is most often sold with three
small UAVs that are housed in a docking station. The Raider UAV has live video capability and a payload containing a net that can be
deployed to intercept a hostile drone. Upon detection of an unauthorized drone, one or more Raider UAVs can be autonomously deployed
at high speeds to track the unauthorized aircraft. If the unauthorized aircraft is deemed hostile, the Raider UAV can deploy the
netting to physically intercept the aircraft. A parachute integrated with the netting allows the intercepted drone to safely fall to
the ground for collection by our customer. 

Partnership
with Siemens 

In
April 2020, Ondas Networks entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility Siemens ), a worldwide leader in
seamless, sustainable, reliable and secure transportation solutions for more than 160 years, to both market our FullMAX-based networking
technology and services and to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens 
Advanced Train Control System ATCS protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform. 

3 

We
believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance across the global
rail market beginning with the North American Class I Railroad market. In the third quarter of 2021 we completed the development of our
first jointly-developed product with Siemens the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems. Siemens is now marketing and selling these
proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS radio systems support Siemens 
extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail
applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring,
Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity,
reduce costs and improve safety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under
the Siemens Airlink brand. 

Our
relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the wider marketing of our wireless
technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has expanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products
with identified opportunities in North American Transit Rail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology
has broad potential in these large, newly targeted markets. 

In
November 2021, Siemens secured its first commercial 900 MHz rail order for a major Class I Railroad in the United States which was delivered
in December 2021. In August 2022, we announced that we had secured an initial volume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz
Network consisting of both ATCS compatible products along with Ondas catalog products. In September 2022, we received government
authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada. 

Our
Strategy 

Our
goal is to be a global leader in providing turnkey data solutions for industrial, public safety and government markets by offering i)
secure wireless connectivity solutions enabling high-bandwidth, mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services through
Ondas Networks and ii) automated commercial drone services through Ondas Autonomous Systems. 

The
acquisition of Airobotics was a transformative event for Ondas. Our strategy will emphasize realizing the financial and strategic benefits
of combining American Robotics and Airobotics under the Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit. We believe this combination will allow
us to accelerate revenue generation and allow us to operate more cost efficiently. The revenue benefits come via expanded global sales
and marketing which is significantly enhanced by introducing the Optimus System to the US market via our American Robotics customer
and field operations staff. Cost efficiencies can be realized via these global sales efforts, elimination of redundant R D efforts,
and through the integration of our product development and engineering teams focused on a single product roadmap. 

The
key elements of our growth strategy include the following: 

Deliver
multiple North American Class I Railroad network opportunities through our FullMAX platform. Our marketing and business development
efforts combined with our exclusive strategic partnership with Siemens has generated the potential for significant sales in our targeted
end markets. We expect large-scale commercial adoption of our network technology by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators in
the newly awarded 900 MHz frequency band. We received an initial volume purchase for commercial deployment in August 2022 from Siemens.
Ondas and Siemens together are working with our railroad customers on commercial deployment strategies which we expect will significantly
increase purchase orders for equipment and services in the North American Class I Rail markets with expansion plans into passenger and
transit markets. In addition, together with Siemens, we are marketing our FullMAX platform as an upgrade for both the 450 MHz HOT network
and the legacy 160 MHz voice-centric networks owned and operated by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators. 

Expand
fleet deployments of our Optimus System as Urban Drone Infrastructure. We have developed a strong customer pipeline
with planned commercial deployments of our Optimus System for public safety and smart city applications. We plan to focus on delivering
our current backlog to existing customers, expanding the revenue collected per unit with additional users, and securing additional orders
for denser, Urban Drone Infrastructure deployment with these customers. In addition, we plan to secure additional customers and distribution
partners for our Optimus System globally including in the United States. 

4 

Continue
to enhance the value of our Optimus System for customers. 

o We plan to continue development of the Optimus System 
to improve functionality and value for customers. Optimus enhancements include the planned integration of technologies and intellectual
property inherent in the Scout System . We believe continuous enhancements to our Optimus System which will include
increased diversity of payloads and more robust analytics capability will serve to increase the value of our drone-driven data solutions
to customers and lead to larger and faster deployments with customers. 

o We
plan to execute programs to lower unit manufacturing costs for the Optimus drone and Airbase. These programs will incorporate a variety
of strategies, including design for manufacturing, replacement component sources, supply chain optimization, and economies of scale.
Lower unit costs will result in improved profitability and allow for expansion into other end markets and system applications. 

Expand
our MC-IoT capabilities via partnerships, joint ventures, or acquisitions. In addition to internal investment and development,
we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our product offerings and solutions for our critical infrastructure
customers via joint ventures, partnerships, and acquisitions. We intend to focus on companies with complementary technologies or product
offerings or synergistic distribution strategies.

and critical infrastructure providers including major rail operators, commercial and industrial drone operators, electric and gas utilities,
water and wastewater utilities, oil and gas producers and pipeline operators, and for other critical infrastructure applications in areas
such as public safety, homeland security and defense, and transportation. We continue to develop our value-added reseller relationships
which today include a strategic partnership with Siemens for the development of new types of wireless connectivity for the North American
Rail market as well as selected global markets in both Europe and Asia. We believe our Siemens partnership is indicative of the
potential for additional Tier 1 partnerships in our other vertical markets including securing reseller relationships with major suppliers
to the worldwide government and homeland security markets. To that end, in 2022, we expanded our relationship with Israel Aerospace Industries 
(IAI) Elta division to deliver wireless solutions for the Integrated Coastal Surveillance markets in the Caribbean and India. 

In
executing our go-to-market strategy, we intend to monetize our software-based intellectual property and grow revenue and cash flow with
embedded FullMAX software sales, Software-as-a-Service SaaS arrangements, IP royalties based on Ondas Networks software
and through additional services provided to customers and ecosystem partners. Customers deploy our connectivity and Fog-computing platform
in private networks that are designed for lifetimes of 10 15 years or even longer. Our FullMAX platform is software-defined and
offers customers flexibility to expand capacity and evolve network utilization. Similarly, our ecosystem partners often integrate our
FullMAX software and wireless capability into their own long-lived equipment and systems which their customers purchase and deploy. As
such, we believe our software solutions provide ongoing revenue opportunities related to both connectivity value and edge computing capability.
Customers and ecosystem partners will require ongoing FullMAX system and security enhancements and for us to design additional features
which create opportunities for additional, recurring revenue and profit streams. Our monetization strategies include: 

Systems
sales: Our FullMAX deployments are typically large, mission-critical wide-area networks deployed and privately operated by our industrial
and government customers. These end-to-end system deployments involve sales consisting of both base stations and edge radio end points
with embedded FullMAX software and network management software and tools. 

5 

Software
and hardware maintenance agreements: Our customers contract with us for extended software and hardware maintenance which provide
them with critical ongoing support for their installed network. These SaaS contracts provide revenue to us in the year following an initial
installation. Software maintenance licenses entitle the customer to ongoing software and security upgrades as well as enabling the provision
of additional system features. Similarly, hardware maintenance programs provide customers extended equipment warranty terms for an installed
network. These SaaS maintenance arrangements allow our customers to continue to maintain a modern, flexible and upgradeable network over
a long period of time. These agreements may extend for multiple years given the long average life of the installed and growing network. 

Licensing
/ Royalties: In certain system deployments, our ecosystem partners will choose to embed FullMAX software into their own hardware
and software platforms providing us with an ongoing per device multi-year revenue stream. Licensing is an effective way for an ecosystem
partner to jumpstart customer activity. Alternatively, a partner may choose to develop software based on our intellectual property generating
royalty revenue. 

Other
Services: We provide ancillary services directly related to the sale of our wireless communications products which include wireless
network design, systems engineering, radio frequency planning, software configuration, product training, installation, and onsite support.
Furthermore, we also provide engineering and product development services to ecosystem partners who are interested in integrating their
intelligent equipment with our FullMAX SDR platform and need our expertise to do so. 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems markets its Optimus System drone platform via a direct sales force to enterprise and government customers.
We focus on identifying and qualifying large, sophisticated customers with active drone programs who have the ability and intent to expand
those programs and eventually deploy fleets of automated drones across their portfolio of assets. After initial customer qualification,
contracting and the receipt of a purchase order, we ship and install the Optimus System on the customer premises. Our field service
personnel remain on location for a short period of time to ensure the programmed automated drone operations are meeting customer requirements. 

Our
Optimus System and the services provided via the autonomous drone platform can typically be acquired by customers under several
arrangements ranging from Data-as-a-Service DaaS agreements to a full, outright sale of an Optimus System . 

Under
a DaaS agreement where we bundle hardware, software, operations, and maintenance into one annual subscription fee. We install an Optimus
System on premises and one or multiple customers can procure services. For example, on a construction site, Airobotics can provide aerial
data services via and Optimus System for security and safety applications, in addition to monitoring and inspection use cases.
In many instances, multiple customers will subscribe for each unique service. The DaaS model is the most typical agreement we have with
customers. 

Our
Optimus System and services can also be provided to end customers via partnerships or joint ventures with third party drone services
providers. Under these arrangements, Airobotics sells an Optimus System to the drone services provider for an upfront payment.
Airobotics and the drone services provider then enter into an agreement to share in the revenues that the system generates via the provision
of aerial data services to end customers. 

Customers
can also purchase an Optimus System whereby they would own and operate the system. Purchases of Optimus typically come with ongoing
services for maintenance. System purchases can be preferred by certain public safety and homeland security customers. 

6 

Airobotics
is in the advanced stages of receiving approval for Type Certification TC from the FAA for the Optimus UAV. TC approval
will enable expanded operation for the Optimus System in the United States including flight operations in populated areas. The
significance of TC approval was highlighted by the FAA decision in April 21, 2021, to amend Part 107 rules which defined new conditions
for Drone flights above people and enables night flight. The new regulations define four categories of Drones and clarify that small
UAS sUAS such as the Optimus drone which are below a certain weight will be permitted to conduct flights above populated
areas without receiving a specific certificate of Part 107 waiver for systems that have TC designations. 

We also market The Raider , the counter-drone system designed
and developed by Iron Drone, a unit within Ondas Autonomous Systems. The Raider is targeted towards government and enterprise customers
who can utilize the system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of hostile drones.
The Raider was formally launched and available to customers in March 2022. We offer this product directly to customers and we intend
to broaden the sales marketing of the Raider with distribution through value-added resellers and partners in the future. 

Our
Products and Services 

Ondas
Networks 

Ondas
Networks has developed a next-generation radio platform specifically to meet the evolving data needs of large industrial and government
customers and markets. These markets are differentiated from consumer markets in that the customers assets are dispersed over very
wide and remote geographies with specific challenges to installation, maintenance, and upgrades. These challenges led us to design
a new type of software-based radio platform capable of supporting a long useful life to the network hardware. Instead of using
low cost, off the shelf, dedicated communications chipsets ASICs ), we selected powerful programmable embedded general-purpose
processors, DSPs, and FPGAs, all of which are software upgradable. Our software defined radio SDR architecture,
with more than 12 years in development and supported by a team of over 50 software engineers, allows us to customize almost any aspect
of the air interface protocol, the key components of which are patented and have been incorporated into new IEEE wireless standards.
The ability to constantly improve customer networks and hosted software applications with flexible, over-the-air software upgrade helps
create customer loyalty and creates high switching costs. 

Our
FullMAX SDR platform is designed to enable highly secure and reliable industrial-grade connectivity for truly mission-critical applications.
An end-to-end FullMAX network consists of connected wireless base stations, fixed and mobile edge radios and supporting technology all
enabled by critical software developed and owned by Ondas Networks. The Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end FullMAX
SDR platform is valued by our customers and ecosystem partners as they seek to leverage the value of MC-IoT applications for improved
safety, efficiency, and profitability. Our IEEE 802.16s compliant equipment is designed to optimize the performance of unused or underutilized
low frequency licensed radio spectrum and narrower channels. We do this through various patented software algorithms including via spectrum
harvesting techniques which aggregate narrowband channels to create increased broadband network capacity. Our channel aggregation
algorithms include the ability to aggregate hard to utilize, non-contiguous narrowband channels and are a hallmark feature of a FullMAX
broadband system. 

The
critical software algorithms powering our end-to-end FullMAX wireless SDR platform and related Fog-computing architecture have been developed
by and are owned by Ondas Networks. FullMAX is an intelligent networking system which integrates core network management systems with
edge computing resources including computing hardware and MC-IoT software applications. In the MC-IoT Fog enabled by FullMAX, base stations
are enabled with a highly configurable Quality of Service algorithms which coordinate the data traffic within the Fog for both the edge
radio and the resident MC-IoT applications. The intelligent base stations control and manage all network resources including our edge
remotes; dynamically allocating bandwidth, prioritizing data packets and managing edge applications. The intelligent software-managed
base stations determine whether to process data at the edge, distribute data traffic across the Fog to other edge remote radios or to
transport information to the corporate Cloud. Our Edge remotes have embedded compute capability and are able to host MC-IoT applications
including those from third party vendors via virtualized software systems managed in docker / container architectures and can also manage
data from intelligent equipment or sensor networks that interface with the edge remotes in the field. Our software-managed edge remotes
offer security via authentication, multi-layer encryption and virtual software firewalls which are requirements for mission-critical
data networks. 

We
are dedicated to promoting standards-based wireless connectivity solutions for our customers. Our FullMAX platform is compliant with
the mission critical wireless Industrial Internet IEEE 802.16s. The specifications in the IEEE 802.16s standard are primarily based on
our FullMAX technology, and many of our customers and industrial partners actively supported our technology during the IEEE standards-making
process. In January 2020, a new working group was launched by the IEEE to establish IEEE 802.16t, a further evolution of this wireless
standard. The IEEE 802.16t working group includes industry-leading trade organizations such as the Association of American Railroads AAR ), MxV Rail MxV Rail ), the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) and the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI), as well as representation from world-leading transportation and oil and gas companies. We expect our technology to remain a prominent
feature of this evolving standard.

Ondas
Autonomous Systems 

We
provide our customers with turnkey data and information solutions designed to meet their unique requirements in the field. We do this
via our internally developed Optimus System , a highly automated commercial drone platform which provides customers with the ability
to continuously digitize, analyze, and monitor their assets and field operations in real-time or near real-time. 

The
Optimus System has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the
real world. The Optimus System consists of (i) Optimus , a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads
(ii) the Airbase TM , a ruggedized weatherproof base station for housing, data processing, and cloud transfer, and (iii) Insightful TM ,
a secure web portal and API which enables remote interaction with the system, data, and resulting analytics anywhere in the world. These
major subsystems are connected via a host of supporting technologies. Using advanced robotic techniques, the Airbase TM has
functionality that enables the automated swapping of batteries and payloads. Automated battery swapping allows for 24/7 operation of
Optimus as the Optimus drone can immediately be redeployed after returning to the dock for a battery swap. Similarly, the ability
to autonomously swap sensors and advanced payloads without human intervention allows for the Optimus System to provide multiple
applications and use cases from a single location. 

When
deployed in smart city applications, the Optimus System is designed to operate as a network of smart drones linked to an urban
control center and will function as a municipal infrastructure providing a variety of automated data solutions. The primary function
of the deployed Urban Drone Infrastructure is to shorten response times of security and rescue forces to emergency situations, supporting
law enforcement and homeland security activities, and streamlining diverse services provided by the municipality for the public s benefit.
The Company is also examining drone parcel delivery and other smart city applications to be provided by the infrastructure. 

In
these deployments, customers establish permanent infrastructure which rely on fleets of automated drones that do not require on the ground
human intervention to operate. The drones are able to operate as a task force that can simultaneously collect and provide critical information
for a variety of customer requirements. The Airobotics drone infrastructure is specifically designed for urban environments and strategic
facilities that require immediate security, monitoring and emergency response. Each system within the infrastructure framework includes
a smart Airbase enabling automated battery changes enabling 24/7 operations, along with the automated loading and installation of sensors
appropriate for each specified mission. Each system covers a perimeter up to 80 square kilometers surrounding an Airbase. Drone flights
can be tasked to carry specific sensors, enabling every drone in the system to execute diverse tasks. The drones can be activated for
complex longer-term operations. Flights are overseen by remote operators in a command-and-control center. 

In
certain geographic markets we will partner with a distributor to support the marketing and provision of aerial data services provided
by an Optimus System . These distributors typically have unique local knowledge and can more cost effectively target customers
for Urban Drone Infrastructure deployment. In some instances, we will form joint ventures with distributors to provide aerial data services
to government and enterprise customers. These joint ventures typically include agreements to purchase Optimus Systems and are
arranged so that Ondas Autonomous Systems and our partner can share in the revenue and profitability in the provision of aerial data
services. 

The Raider is a counter-drone
system, which was designed and developed by Iron Drone, that we are marketing to government and enterprise customers who can utilize the
system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of hostile drones. A typical Raider 
deployment location would include sensitive locations such as borders, stadiums or schools, or near critical assets such as power plants
and military bases, and for high profile locations such as amusement parks or where public events are held. 

The Raider is designed to detect, track and intercept unauthorized,
or hostile unmanned aircraft and is most often sold with three small UAVs that are housed in a docking station. The Raider UAV has live
video capability and a payload containing a net that can be deployed to intercept a hostile drone. Upon detection of an unauthorized drone,
one or more Raider UAVs can be autonomously deployed at high speeds to track the unauthorized aircraft. If the unauthorized aircraft
is deemed hostile, the Raider UAV can deploy the netting to physically intercept the aircraft. A parachute integrated with the
netting allows the intercepted drone to safely fall to the ground for collection by our customer.

The
Market for Our Products and Services 

We
have targeted the North American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently
operate legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These
legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management
systems. In addition to data capacity challenges, rail operators need to reliably cover the vast and often remotely located rail track
and related infrastructure which extends nationwide. The rail operators require a next-generation, robust broadband system with significantly
increased data throughput capacity and flexibility to adopt new applications. We believe a transition to integrated Fog-computing wireless
communications systems will enable the rail operators to drive more intelligence to the edge of their operating environments enabling
real time automation and better operator control of many critical operating systems related to train control, crossing safety, train
and track integrity and drone operations. This upgrade cycle is being driven by a recent key event which occurred in August 2020 in which
the Class 1 rail systems in the U.S. were awarded new nationwide greenfield wideband radio spectrum by the Federal Communications
Committee FCC ). As part of the award, the rail operators are required by 2025, to vacate a series of legacy narrowband
channels. The completion of this multiyear negotiation between the FCC and other licensed users is projected to generate a major network
upgrade cycle for the rail industry which will support enhanced safety and improved efficiency and profitability of train operations. 

The
North American Rail Network is vast in scale, consisting of 140,000 miles of track, 25,000 locomotives, and 1.6 million railcars. Within
this large footprint, we believe there are 200,000 highway crossings, with at least 65,000 of the crossings equipped with electronic
systems today, a number which is expected to increase in the coming years. The Class I railroads currently operate four separate private
wireless networks in support of train operations. Those networks are deployed using spectrum in the 160 MHz, 220 MHz, 450 MHz and 900
MHz bands. We believe a significant portion of the communications infrastructure has been in operation for more than 20 years and now
requires a technological upgrade to support new applications and increased capacity requirements. Our FullMAX MC-IoT platform offers
an excellent migration path for these applications. The Class I Railroads value the ability of our frequency agnostic SDR architecture
to enable a substantial data capacity increase utilizing the railroad s existing wireless infrastructure and dedicated FCC licensed
radio frequencies, as well as the flexibility to adapt to and take advantage of future changes in spectrum availability, as well as future
business and operational requirements. Based upon management estimates, we believe the addressable market for the four private North
American Railroad networks is approximately 1.3 billion. We believe the 900 MHz network will be the first network upgrade to adopt our
FullMAX technology and we estimate that the market size for the 900 MHz network is approximately 450 million. 

Additional
Critical Markets 

We
have launched additional initiatives to take our MC-IoT connectivity and ecosystem partnering strategy into other critical infrastructure
markets. In June 2022, we announced the first successful installation of our technology into an Integrated Coastal Surveillance System
(ICSS) in the Caribbean with a global defense contractor. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received and delivered on a new ICSS order
for the defense contractor to be deployed in India. We expect additional orders from this defense vendor for the ICSS application in
2023. We believe our FullMAX technology s licensed frequency flexibility, reliability, and long communications range over ocean surfaces,
is broadening the scale of our technology in this emerging market for homeland security. 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems 

The
total addressable market TAM for commercial drone applications is also large measuring over 100 billion in size,
according to management estimates and independent third-party research. For the vast majority of commercial drone applications, full
automation is required to make economic sense. The time and cost requirements of human pilots are too high for the demanding and monotonous
routines that must be performed to extract value. Ondas Autonomous Systems drone platforms target the majority of drone-in-a-box -applicable
commercial, public safety and defense markets. 

Based
upon management estimates, we believe the market size for the Smart City applications for the Optimus System to be over 15 billion. 

Smart City Market 15.1
 billion TAM): the Smart City market consists of a range of sub-markets, including police, fire, medical, logistics, construction,
 utilities, infrastructure, ports, airports, and environmental surveys. For these markets, the Optimus System is used for routine,
 high-resolution automated emergency response, mapping, surveying, and inspection. These automated operations reduce the response
 time to emergency situations, increase safety and security, and reduce the cost of city services. 

9 

According
to a report by GrandView Research published in 2020, Counter-UAS markets are estimated to have a market size of over 10 billion in size. 

Counter-UAS Market 10.8
 billion TAM): the Counter-UAS market consists of a range of sub-markets, including homeland security, defense, stadiums and public
 events, energy sites, airports, and cities. For these markets, autonomous drone technology is used for automated immediate response
 to potential drone threats and disabling of hostile drones if required. 

A
report from PWC in 2016 stated that the market size for the commercial drone sector was in excess of 125 billion. PWC segmented the
commercial market into three primary categories, Industrial, Agricultural, and Defense. We estimate the collective TAM for the Optimus
System and anticipated derivative products within these three target markets to be 114 billion. For each market, the core automation
technology is similar, but the product is optimized for that set of use cases. Primary differences include payload as well as the user
interface UI and user experience UX and analytics packages within Insightful . 

Industrial Market 68.1
 billion TAM): the Industrial market consists of a range of sub-markets, including those within the Energy, Infrastructure, and
 Security sectors. For these markets, the Optimus System is used for routine, high-resolution automated monitoring of assets,
 such as well pads, pipelines, solar panels, rail track, stockpile yards, and electrical substations. This automated monitoring helps
 reduce customer operations and maintenance costs, increase uptime of assets, increase safety and security, and improve regulatory
 compliance. 

Agricultural Market
 25.6 billion TAM): the Agricultural market consists of a range of sub-markets, including those within the Row Crop, Specialty
 Crop, and Research Development sectors. For these markets, the Optimus System is used for routine, high-resolution automated
 monitoring of crops, such as corn, soybeans, vineyards, and orchards. This automated monitoring helps reduce labor costs, reduce
 input costs such as water, pesticides, and fertilizer, and increase yields. 

Defense
 Market (20.2 billion TAM): the Defense market consists of a range of sub-markets, each relating to increased Information,
 Surveillance, and Reconnaissance ISR capabilities for Border, Site, and Vehicle assets. For these markets, the
 Optimus System is used for automated immediate response ISR, providing high-resolution, real-time situational awareness
 for multiple applications including warfighters on the battlefield. 

Customer
Activity 

Ondas
Networks 

The
majority of Ondas Networks customer activity has been with the Class 1 freight railroad operators and Siemens in North America. There
are seven Class I railroads in North America, all of which run multiple, frequency-specific networks for different applications. Our
FullMAX platform has the flexibility to operate in all these frequency bands and will allow these customers the opportunity to better
utilize their radio spectrum and add more high-value, data-intensive applications to their operations. Ondas Networks has completed multiple,
ongoing testing and pilot programs with BNSF Railway and CSX Corporation, two North American Class I freight railroad operators in connection
with the system validation performed on behalf of the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Wireless Communications Committee
(WCC). Our initial focus with these rail customers has been for train control applications and related safety systems in the 900 MHz
frequency band where the FCC has recently awarded our railroad customers new radio spectrum. 

In August 2022, we received our first commercial volume order for the
900 MHz network from Siemens. We also delivered a Rail Lab (the dot16 Rail Lab to MxV Rail, a subsidiary of the AAR, in
September 2022. The dot16 Rail Lab is hosting multiple Class 1 freight rail operators where they will perform on going network design
and configuration related to optimizing the performance of our IEEE 802.16 complaint systems in connection with wide-scale field deployment.
We expect the commercial rollout of the 900 MHz to accelerate with the Class 1 freight rail operators throughout 2023 with multiple rail
customers providing purchase orders and deploying our software-defined network. We expect a 900 MHz network upgrade cycle across all Class
I railroad systems over the next few years in order to comply with FCC license requirements and meet business needs related to safety
and profitability. 

10 

As
of December 31, 2022, Ondas Networks was active with six of the Class 1 Rails in North America and with one of the largest railroads
in the world, Indian Railways, for a multi-year delivery program of locomotive radios for on-board telemetry applications. Also in 2022,
we received our first order for 160 MHz radios, a bridge to the next major rail network in North America, which we believe will be upgraded
to our FullMAX platform. 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems 

Our
Optimus System addresses a wide number of applications and use cases across enterprise, industrial, and government end markets.
The platform has been extensively tested both internally and externally with customers for reliability, safety, and performance. We received
purchase orders from two customers in the UAE in December 2022, which represented our initial orders for commercial deployment as Urban
Drone Infrastructure fleets. The initial purchase order was received for a UAE government entity with plans to primarily use the system
for public safety and homeland security applications. We also announced a purchase order from Abu Dhabi-based SkyGo Transport of Goods
L.L.C. SkyGo ). Airobotics and SkyGo have also signed a Term Sheet agreeing to enter into a joint venture (the SkyGo
JV to provide aerial drone services to municipal and government customers focused on Smart City use cases. 

Customer
interest in our aerial data services has grown significantly since receiving these initial fleet orders and that is reflected in a growing
customer pipeline. The initial two customers have indicated plans to deploy approximately 50 systems in the UAE by 2025 and we believe
demand could grow further. In addition, moving customers from proof-of-concept deployments to Urban Drone Infrastructure fleet deployments
has validated the performance and value of our Optimus System , which has helped both accelerate our marketing activity with existing
customers and generated new customer interest to help expand the pipeline. We expect interest in our Optimus System to grow significantly
as awareness builds which will expand our customer pipeline. 

We
expect to expand customer activity in the United States as American Robotics introduces Optimus to its existing customers and expands
marketing to new customers. In the United States, we are qualifying our oil and gas customers for marketing programs, and we plan to
expand marketing to other industrial and government markets. 

We launched our Raider counter-drone system in March 2023 and
began seeking customer orders at the same time. We have seen significant interest in the Raider For potential customers and partners
and on March 10, 2023 we announced that the Dubai Police has signed an MOU which expressed their intent to purchase a certain number of
units of the Raider . We expect to receive additional orders as we expand marketing channels in 2023.

developed with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This intellectual property is critical to the development of end-to-end
systems which reliably enable the automated operation of drones in real-world environments. 

We
have a policy of requiring our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and parties with which we do business to
enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure NDAs and assignment of invention agreements before disclosure of any of our
confidential or proprietary information. 

Seasonality 

We
do not believe that the industry in which Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems competes is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation. 

Dependence
on a Single Customer 

Because
we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial
amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 1,893,000 of our revenue, or
approximately 89 . During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately 1,204,000 and 1,599,000 of our
revenue, or approximately 41 and 55 , respectively. 

Competition 

Ondas
Networks 

We
compete with alternatives to wireless technology, public cellular data networks and private wireless networking products from other manufactures.
We believe that each of these competing solutions has core weaknesses when compared to FullMAX, as described below. 

Public
cellular data networks: 

Public networks are more
 vulnerable to cyber security attacks from anywhere in the world including denial of service attacks; private networks can operate
 independent of the public internet. 

Public networks are more
 susceptible to prolonged outages during man-made and natural disasters (e.g. 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, etc.), exactly when utilities
 and mission critical entities require the greatest reliability. 

Public networks are typically
 designed for population coverage rather than the geographic areas required by critical infrastructure providers, which often include
 remote locations. 

Public networks are by
 definition oversubscribed, shared networks without the necessary prioritization service to support mission critical applications. 

Public networks typically
 use shared infrastructure including tower sites and long-haul fiber connections resulting in vulnerabilities at many points. 

Public networks are designed
 to support high capacity downloading and streaming applications with limited upload bandwidth available. Industrial networks typically
 require the reverse traffic flow, often uploading data from a large number of remote locations. 

13 

Other
private wireless products: 

Unlicensed Point to Multipoint
 Wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi) This equipment is very inexpensive to purchase but is subject to interference, has many security vulnerabilities,
 uses a contention-based protocol and transmits only over short range. Deploying Wi-Fi over wide areas is cost prohibitive. 

Private Licensed Narrowband
 Wireless Radios These networks can provide good coverage and range but are typically too slow and lack sufficient bandwidth
 to support new applications and the increased number of data connections required. 

Alternate
technologies: 

Satellite Technologies
 These technologies provide good coverage, but throughput is limited, and latency is too high to support mission-critical
 applications for our customers. These technologies can be very costly as compared to our products and systems. 

Low-Power Wide Area Networks
 (LP-WANs) LP-WAN solutions such as LoRa and NB-IoT are architected with lower power, the purpose of which is to make these
 typically sensor-based networks lower-cost solutions. The low powered equipment means these systems have lower throughput and higher
 latency and are not reliable for mission-critical applications that require both monitoring and control functions. 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems 

We
compete with other drone OEMs providing a variety of solutions for inspection, security, asset tracking and other applications. We compete
on many dimensions with system performance being differentiated by the level of autonomous operation, ease of use, reliability, safety,
and government regulations. Further, leading automated data solution providers must provide diverse payload capabilities for data collection,
along with robust, advanced analytics programs that are specific for each industry served. 

Governmental
Regulations 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws
and regulations including: (i) authorization from the FCC for operation in various licensed frequency bands; (ii) FAA regulations and
approvals unique to the operation of commercial or industrial drones; (iii) customers licenses from the FCC; (iv) licensing, permitting
and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers; (v) regulations relating to worker safety and environmental
protection; (vi) permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; (vii) wage and hour regulations; (viii) regulations
relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements; (ix) building and electrical codes;
and (x) special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects. 

14 

We
believe we have the licenses materially required to conduct our operations, and we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements. The operation of our manufactured products by our customers (network providers and service providers) in the U.S. or in
foreign jurisdictions in a manner not in compliance with local law could result in fines, business disruption, or harm to our reputation. The
changes to regulatory and technological requirements may also alter our product offerings, impacting our market share and business. Failure
to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or could give rise to
termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities. 

Environmental
Regulation 

Our
operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, federal, state and local environmental laws and substantial related regulation
by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements
that regulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; protect the health and safety of workers;
and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes
significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Notwithstanding these burdens, we believe that we are in material compliance with all
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations. 

There
has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements nor competitive positions as a result of these environmental
regulations. 

Employees

As
of March 10, 2023, we have 116 full-time employees, including 40 in the Ondas Networks segment and 76 in the Ondas Autonomous Systems
segment. In addition, we have consulting agreements with 17 consultants for manufacturing, supply chain, documentation, engineering,
regulatory, IT, and business development support. Additionally, from time to time, we may hire temporary employees. We also utilize contractors
to manufacture components, for certain research and development and for system deployment functions. None of our employees are covered
by a collective bargaining agreement and we are unaware of any union organizing efforts. We consider our relationship with our employees
to be good.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following
risks, as well as general economic and business risks, and all of the other information contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following
risks could harm our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline,
which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. When determining whether to invest, you should also refer to the other
information contained in this Form 10-K including our financial statements and the related notes thereto. 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

We
have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability. 

Since
our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately 154 million and 80 million, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through
sales of our equity securities and debt financing. 

We
expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we pursue our growth strategy, including expending substantial resources for
research, development and marketing. The extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain,
and we expect to continue incurring significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Any additional operating losses
may have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and the price of our common stock, and we cannot assure you that we will
ever be able to achieve profitability. 

Even
if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability. Additionally, our costs may increase in future
periods and we may expend substantial financial and other resources on, among things, sales and marketing, the hiring of additional officers,
employees, contractors and other service providers, and general administration, which may include a significant increase in legal and
accounting expenses related to public company compliance, continued compliance and various regulations applicable to our business or
arising from the growth and maturity of our company. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company
and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain regulatory approvals, diversify
our product and service offerings or continue our operations, and may cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

The
adoption of the IEEE 802.16s wireless broadband standard by customers in our target critical infrastructure sectors is uncertain. 

The
IEEE 802.16s wireless broadband standard was published in October 2017. In addition, we are currently the only manufacturer of IEEE 802.16s
compliant equipment. The benefit of the standard to buyers of our equipment are greater when there exists a large, deep market in terms
of the number of customers. A large market benefits from the scale provided such that many vendors can compete on service, price and
quality of solution driving improved value for customers. If a large end market does not develop and customers do not see the related
benefits from the standard, we may not be able to grow our business. 

16 

Our
growth depends in part on the success of our strategic partnerships with third parties such as Siemens Mobility, who are also customers,
as well as on our ability to establish a broad range of additional ecosystem partner and customer relationships with leading global industrial
vendors . 

In
order to grow our business, we depend on partnerships with market leading technology and industrial companies such as Siemens Mobility,
who are also customers of Ondas Networks in order to accelerate the adoption of our wireless technology. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining
our partnership and customer relationships with third parties, including Siemens Mobility, or if our partnerships do not provide us the
anticipated benefits, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may
suffer. In addition, adoption of our FullMAX wireless platform and Optimus System requires us to establish additional ecosystem
relationships with leading global industrial vendors and customers. Even if we are successful in executing these partnerships and integrating
with additional ecosystem vendors, we cannot assure you that these partnerships and relationships will result in increased adoption of
our technology or increased revenue. 

If
the commercial UAS markets do not experience significant growth, if we cannot expand our customer base or if our products and services
do not achieve broad acceptance, then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth. 

We
cannot accurately predict the future growth rates or sizes of the markets for our products and services. Demand for our products and
services may not increase, or may decrease, either generally or in specific markets, for particular types of products and services or
during particular time periods. We believe the market for commercial UAS is nascent and the expansion of the market for our products
and services in particular, depends on a number of factors, including the following: 

customer satisfaction with
 these types of systems as solutions; 

the cost, performance and
 reliability of our products and products offered by our competitors; 

customer perceptions regarding
 the effectiveness and value of these types of systems; 

obtaining timely regulatory
 approvals for new customer deployments; and 

marketing efforts and publicity
 regarding these types of systems and services. 

Even
if commercial UAS gain wide market acceptance, our products and services may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue
to gain market acceptance. If these types of systems generally, or our products and services specifically, do not gain wide market acceptance,
then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our revenue and results of operations would decline. 

Negative
customer perception regarding the commercial UAS industry or the Company s automated data solutions could have a material adverse
effect on the demand for the Company s products and the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of
the Company. 

The
Company believes the commercial UAS industry is highly dependent upon customer perception regarding the safety, efficacy, and quality
of the commercial UAS system deployed. Customer perception of these products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or
findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention, and other publicity. There can be no assurance that future scientific
research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention, or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to
the UAS market. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived
as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the
demand for the Company s products and the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company. The
dependence upon customer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media
attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the demand
for the Company s products, and the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company. 

17 

Failure
to manage our planned growth could place a significant strain on our resources. 

Our
ability to successfully implement our business plan requires an effective plan for managing our future growth. We plan to increase the
scope of our operations. Current and future expansion efforts will be expensive and may significantly strain our managerial and other
resources and ability to manage working capital. To manage future growth effectively, we must manage expanded operations, integrate new
personnel and maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls. If we do not manage growth properly, it could harm
our business, financial condition or results of operations and make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations. 

We
may be unsuccessful in achieving our organic growth strategies, which could limit our revenue growth or financial performance. Our ability
to generate organic growth will be affected by our ability to, among other things: 

attract new customers; 

increase the number of
 products purchased from customers; 

maintain profitable gross
 margins in the sale and maintenance of our products; 

increase the number of
 projects performed for existing customers; 

achieve the estimated revenue
 we announced from new customer contracts; 

hire and retain qualified
 employees; 

expand the range of our
 products and services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs; 

expand geographically,
 including internationally; and 

address the challenges
 presented by difficult and unpredictable global and regional economic or market conditions that may affect us or our customers. 

Many
of the factors affecting our ability to generate organic growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies
for achieving internal growth will be attempted, realized or successful. 

If
we fail to retain our existing customers or do not acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our
business, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed. 

We
believe that our success is dependent on our ability to continue identifying and anticipating the needs of our customers, to retain our
existing customers and to add new customers. For example, our business plan is designed to penetrate large, critical infrastructure end
markets with our wireless and UAS driven data solutions and have expanded our dedicated sales resources and field personnel to broaden
our marketing and field support efforts into new industries and sectors. As a result, we have significantly increased customer engagement
in the transportation, security and UAS end markets with Ondas Networks and in the industrial, public safety and government markets with
Ondas Autonomous Systems. We expect that our qualified customer pipeline will increase in other additional strategic end markets. However,
as we become larger through organic growth, the growth rates for customer engagement, project volume and average spend per customer may
slow, even if we continue to add customers on an absolute basis. In addition, the costs associated with customer retention may be substantially
lower than costs associated with the acquisition of new customers. Therefore, our failure to retain existing customers, even if such
losses are offset by an increase in revenue resulting from the acquisition of new customers, could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. 

Additionally,
while a key part of our business strategy is to add customers in our existing geographic markets, we expect to expand our operations
into new geographic markets. In doing so, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter new markets successfully. Our expansion into
new markets may place us in unfamiliar and competitive environments and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant
resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. 

18 

The
Company faces uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy. 

Adverse
changes in the economy could negatively impact the Company s business. Future economic distress may result in a decrease in demand
for the Company s products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company s operating results and financial condition.
Uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase costs associated with developing and publishing products, increase
the cost and decrease the availability of sources of financing, and increase the Company s exposure to material losses from bad
debts, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and operating results of the Company. 

Any
outbreak or worsening of an outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse
effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 

Any
outbreak or worsening of an outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse
effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread to other regions of the world, and has resulted
in increased travel restrictions, business disruptions and emergency quarantine measures across the world including the United States.
The Company s business, financial condition and results of operations were impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic during the year
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as follows: 

sales and marketing efforts
 were disrupted as our business development team was unable to travel to visit customers and customers were unable to receive visitors
 for on-location meetings; 

field activity for testing
 and deploying our wireless systems was delayed due to the inability for our field service team to install and test equipment for
 our customers; 

supply chain disruptions
 led to component shortages and inefficiencies in and delays in producing and delivering equipment for certain purchase orders; and 

delays in fulfilling purchase
 orders reduced our cash flow from operations. 

The
Company expects its business, financial condition and results of operations will be impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2023,
primarily due to supply chain disruptions due to pandemic-related plant and port shutdowns, transportation delays, government actions
and other factors, which may be beyond our control. The global shortage of certain components such as semiconductor chips, strains on
production or extraction of raw materials, cost inflation, and labor and equipment shortages, could escalate in future quarters. Labor
shortages have led and may continue to lead to difficult conditions for hiring and retention of employees, and increased labor costs.
Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and remains an unknown risk for the foreseeable future. The extent to which the coronavirus
may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information
which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus. As a result, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the full extent
of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on its future business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the Company
were to experience any new impact to its operations or incur additional unanticipated costs and expenses as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, such operational delays and unanticipated costs and expenses there could be a further adverse impact on the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operations during 2023. 

We
have significant dependence on a small number of customers, and the loss of such customers or a decrease in business conducted with such
customers could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Because
we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial
amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 1,893,000 of our revenue, or
approximately 89 . During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately 1,204,000 and 1,599,000 of our
revenue, or approximately 41 and 55 , respectively. The loss of the 2022 customer or a decrease in the business conducted with
such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

19 

Project
performance delays or difficulties, including those caused by third parties, or certain contractual obligations may result in additional
costs to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages. 

Many
projects involve challenging engineering, construction or installation phases that may occur over extended time periods. We may encounter
difficulties as a result of delays or changes in designs, engineering information or materials provided by our customer or a third party,
delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our customer s failure to timely obtain
permits or meet other regulatory requirements including the securing of necessary FCC certifications or FAA approvals, weather-related
delays and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the
original delivery schedule. In addition, we contract with third-party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts. Any
delay or failure by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may be beyond our control and may
result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. Delays and additional costs
may be substantial, and, in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays. Delays may also disrupt the final
completion of our contracts as well as the corresponding recognition of revenues and expenses therefrom. In certain circumstances, we
guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels; failure
to meet any of our guarantees, schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties to us, including
obligations to pay liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors
could cause project cancellations, and we may be unable to replace such projects with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations
may impact our reputation, brand or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts. 

Our
contractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these relationships, either
of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
depend on third party contractors to complete manufacturing, certain research and development and deployment functions. There is a risk
that we may have disputes with contractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the contractor,
customer concerns about the contractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders. In addition, if any of
our contractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services, then our ability
to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. In addition, the absence of qualified contractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship
could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Any of these factors may have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Material
delays or defaults in customer payments could leave us unable to cover expenditures related to such customer s projects, including
the payment of our subcontractors. 

Because
of the nature of most of our contracts, we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from our customers in amounts sufficient
to cover expenditures as they are incurred. In certain cases, these expenditures include paying our contractors and purchasing parts.
If a customer defaults in making its payments on a project or projects to which we have devoted significant resources, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Certain
of our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers may work on projects that are inherently dangerous, and a failure
to maintain a safe worksite could result in significant losses. 

Certain
of our project sites can place our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and others, including third
parties, in difficult or dangerous environments, and may involve difficult and hard to reach terrain, high elevation, or locations near
large or complex equipment, moving vehicles, high voltage or other safety hazards or dangerous processes. Safety is a primary focus of
our business and maintaining a good reputation for safety is critical to our business. Many of our customers require that we meet certain
safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety
and environmental procedures throughout our company. Maintaining such programs involves variable costs which may increase as governmental,
regulatory and industry safety standards evolve, and any increase in such costs may materially affect or business, financial condition
or results of operations. Further, if we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures or if our procedures fail, our officers,
employees, contractors and other service providers, including third parties, may suffer injuries. Failure to comply with such procedures,
client contracts or applicable regulations, or the occurrence of such injuries, could subject us to material losses and liability and
may adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the future or to hire and retain talented officers, employees, contractors
and other services providers, therefore materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

20 

Warranty
claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We
generally warrant our manufactured products, including hardware and software, for a period of one year from the date of receipt of the
product by the customer. After the first year, the customer can pay for extended hardware warranty and software maintenance and upgrades
on an annual basis in advance. While costs that we have incurred historically under our warranty obligations have not been material,
the costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty related legal proceedings, are variable and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our
products are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial
time and resources in the design of their products. 

Many
of our customers are conservative in their decision-making process. Sales cycles for new customers can vary from one to three years depending
on the complexity of the customer s network, whether the customer is subject to state regulations, and annual budget cycles. During
this lengthy sales cycle, our potential customers may cancel or change their product plans. Customers may also discontinue products incorporating
our devices at any time or they may choose to replace our products with lower cost semiconductors. In addition, we are working with leading
customers in our target markets to define our future products. If customers cancel, reduce or delay product orders from us, or choose
not to release products that incorporate our devices after we have spent substantial time and resources developing products or assisting
customers with their product design, our revenue levels may be less than anticipated and our business, results of operations and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected. 

Our
marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing customers. 

Our
marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current and past customers to provide positive references to new,
potential customers. A material portion of our current pipeline activity is concentrated in the transportation and aviation sectors as
well as in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Given our limited number of customers, the loss or dissatisfaction of any customer could substantially
harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market acceptance of our products and services, and impair our ability to attract new customers
and maintain existing customers. Further, as we expand into new vertical and geographic end markets, references from existing customers
could be similarly important. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

If
our products contain defects or otherwise fail to perform as expected, we could be liable for damages and incur unanticipated warranty,
recall and other related expenses, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose market share and, as a result, our financial condition
or results of operations could suffer. 

Our
products rely on complex avionics, sensors, user-friendly interfaces and tightly integrated, electromechanical designs to accomplish
their missions. Our products may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design, materials, manufacture,
deployment and/or use. If any of our products contain a defect, compatibility or interoperability issue or other error, we may have to
devote significant time and resources to find and correct the issue. Such efforts could divert the attention of our management team and
other relevant personnel from other important tasks. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could (i) be expensive;
(ii) damage our reputation and relationships with utilities and other third-party vendors; (iii) result in the loss of business to competitors;
and (iv) result in litigation against us. Costs associated with field replacement labor, hardware replacement, re-integration with third-party
products, handling charges, correcting defects, errors and bugs, or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial
results. 

As
a manufacturer of UAV products, and with aircraft and aviation sector companies under increased scrutiny, claims could be brought against
us if use or misuse of one of our UAV products causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. In addition, defects
in our products may lead to other potential life, health and property risks. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could
severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources. 

21 

The
existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products or the misuse of our products could also lead to product liability claims
or lawsuits against us. A defect, error or failure in one of our products could result in injury, death or property damage and significantly
damage our reputation and support for our products in general. We anticipate this risk will grow as our products begin to be used in
U.S. domestic airspace and urban areas. 

Although
we maintain insurance policies, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments
and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices
or at all. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost to us. Even if we are fully insured as it relates to
a claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish our brand and divert management s attention and resources, which could have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Estimated
future product warranty claims are based on the expected number of field failures over the warranty commitment period, the term of the
product warranty period, and the costs for repair, replacement and other associated costs. Our warranty obligations are affected by product
failure rates, claims levels, material usage and product re-integration and handling costs. 

Because
our products are relatively new and we do not yet have the benefit of long-term experience observing products performance in the
field, our estimates of a product s lifespan and incidence of claims may be inaccurate. Should actual product failure rates, claims
levels, material usage, product re-integration and handling costs, defects, errors, bugs or other issues differ from the original estimates,
we could end up incurring materially higher warranty or recall expenses than we anticipate. 

Our
Optimus System makes use of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have
occasionally been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flames. If such events occur with our products, we could face liability associated
with our warranty, for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which would adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

The
battery packs in our Optimus drone use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop computers and cell phones.
On occasion, if not appropriately managed and controlled, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke
and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into
flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. These events also have raised questions about the suitability of
these lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. There can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not occur,
which would damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is some risk of
electrocution if individuals who attempt to repair battery packs on our vehicles do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols.
Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity could adversely
affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

Due
to the volatile and flammable nature of certain components of our products and equipment, fires or explosions may disrupt our business
or cause significant injuries, which could adversely affect our financial results. 

The
development and manufacture of certain of our products involves the handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials as well
as high power equipment. From time to time, these activities may result in incidents that could cause us to temporarily shut down or
otherwise disrupt some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and/or fatalities.
We have safety and loss prevention programs that require detailed reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety
audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies, however our
insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all claims and losses related to such incidents. We may experience such incidents in the
future, which could result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Our
technology, products and services have only been developed in the last several years and we have had only limited opportunities to deploy
and assess their performance in the field at full scale. 

The
current generation of our FullMAX and Optimus System technology platforms have only been developed in the last several years and
will continue to evolve. Deploying and operating our technology is complex and, until recently, had been done primarily by a small number
of customers. As the size, complexity and scope of our deployments grow we have been able to test product performance at a greater scale
and in a variety of new geographic settings and environmental conditions. As the number, size and complexity of our deployments grow
and we deploy our technology platforms for new applications in new critical infrastructure industries, we may encounter unforeseen operational,
technical and other challenges, some of which could cause significant delays, trigger contractual penalties, result in unanticipated
expenses, and/or damage to our reputation, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

22 

If
we fail to respond to evolving technological changes, our products and services could become obsolete or less competitive. 

We
operate in highly competitive industries characterized by new and rapidly evolving technologies, standards, regulations, customer requirements,
as well as frequent product introductions and revisions. Accordingly, our operating results depend upon our ability to develop and introduce
new products and services, our ability to reduce production costs of our existing products. The process of developing new technologies
and products is complex, and if we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing products and services or
acceptable new products and services that keep pace with technological developments or industry standards, our products may become obsolete,
less marketable and less competitive and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly harmed. 

We
depend on our ability to develop new products and to enhance and sustain the quality of existing products. 

Our
growth and future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design and manufacture new competitive products and to
enhance and sustain the quality and marketability of our existing products. As such, we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial
investments in technology development. In the future, we may not have the necessary capital, or access to capital on acceptable terms,
to fund necessary levels of research and development. Even with adequate capital resources, we may nonetheless experience unforeseen
problems in the development or performance of our technologies or products. In addition, we may not meet our product development schedules
and, even if we do, we may not develop new products fast enough to provide sufficient differentiation from our competitors products,
which may be more successful. 

We
expect to incur substantial research and development costs and devote significant resources to identifying and commercializing new products
and services, which could significantly reduce our profitability and may never result in revenue to us. 

Our
future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications and new environments, and introducing
new products and services that achieve market acceptance. We plan to incur substantial research and development costs as part of our
efforts to design, develop and commercialize new products and services and enhance existing products. For example, we will incur research
and development costs to improve the functionality of our acoustic DAA solution configuration in certain environments, in addition to
integrating new payloads to broaden the functionality of our Optimus System . Further, our research and development programs may
not produce successful results, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become
profitable, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial results and liquidity. 

If
our products do not interoperate with our customers other systems, the purchase or deployment of our products and services may
be delayed or cancelled. 

Our
products are designed to interface with our customers other systems, each of which may have different specifications and utilize
multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of these
products as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or
defects in the hardware used in our customers systems, we may need to modify our products or services to fix or overcome these
errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products and services do not interoperate with our customers 
systems, customers may seek to hold us liable, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be
delayed or cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation or brand, and seriously harm our prospects, business,
financial condition or results of operations. 

23 

The
Company operates in a competitive market. 

The
Company faces competition and new competitors will continue to emerge throughout the world. Services offered by the Company s competitors
may take a larger share of customer spending than anticipated, which could cause revenue generated from the Company s products
and services to fall below expectations. It is expected that competition in these markets will intensify. If competitors of the Company
develop and market more successful products or services, offer competitive products or services at lower price points, or if the Company
does not produce consistently high-quality and well-received products and services, revenues, margins, and profitability of the Company
will decline. 

The
Company s ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, the Company s pricing of services and equipment,
quality of customer service and field support, development of new and enhanced products and services in response to customer demands
and changing technology, reach and quality of sales and distribution channels and capital resources. Competition could lead to a reduction
in the rate at which the Company adds new customers, a decrease in the size of the Company s market share and a decline in its
customers. 

We
rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key officers, employees,
contractors and other service providers or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial
condition or results of operations. 

We
depend, in part, on the performance of Eric Brock, our Chief Executive Officer, Derek Reisfield, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer
and Secretary, Reese Mozer, our President. Stewart Kantor and Menashe Shahar, the President and Chief Technology Officer of Ondas Networks,
respectively, and Meir Kliner and Yishay Curelaru, the President and Chief Financial Officer of Ondas Autonomous Systems, respectively,
to operate and grow our business. The loss of any of Messrs. Brock, Reisfield, Mozer, Kantor, Shahar, Kliner or Curelaru could negatively
impact our ability to execute our business strategies. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Brock, Reisfield,
Mozer, Kantor and Shahar, we may be unable to retain them or replace any of them if we lose their services for any reason. 

Our
future success will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management, product development, operations,
sales, technical and other personnel in the United States and abroad. Even in today s economic climate, competition for these types
of personnel is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley. All of our employees, contractors and other service providers in the United
States work for us on an at-will basis. Given the lengthy sales cycles with utilities and deployment periods of our networking platform
and solutions, the loss of key personnel at any time could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Cyberattacks
through security vulnerabilities could lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to
our reputation or competitive position. 

Security
vulnerabilities may arise from our hardware, software, employees, contractors or policies we have deployed, which may result in external
parties gaining access to our networks, datacenters, cloud datacenters, corporate computers, manufacturing systems, and or access to
accounts we have at our suppliers, vendors, and customers. They may gain access to our data or our users or customers data
or attack the networks causing denial of service or attempt to hold our data or systems in ransom. The vulnerability could be caused
by inadequate account security practices such as failure to timely remove employee access when terminated. To mitigate these security
issues, we have implemented measures throughout our organization, including firewalls, backups, encryption, employee information technology
policies and user account policies. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be sufficient to avoid cyberattacks. If any
of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners
and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation
and possible significant liability. 

24 

Further,
if we fail to adequately maintain our infrastructure, we may have outages and data loss. Excessive outages may affect our ability to
timely and efficiently deliver products to customers or develop new products and solutions. Such disruptions and data loss may adversely
impact our ability to fulfill orders, patent our intellectual property or protect our source code, and interrupt other processes. Delayed
sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. 

Unauthorized
use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether through breach of our systems,
breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or through employee or contractor error, theft or misuse,
or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to
occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and
investigations, related actions, and penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying
affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating
to the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to,
or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers
and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
do not control certain aspects of the manufacturing process. 

Our
reliance on a small number of manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced
control over quality assurance, product costs and product supply including delays in transportation and delivery. Any manufacturing disruption
by our usual manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders. We may be unable to manage our relationships with our usual manufacturers
effectively as they may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations
or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery. Similarly, to the extent that our usual manufacturers procure
materials on our behalf, we may not benefit from any warranties received by our usual manufacturers from the suppliers or otherwise have
recourse against the original supplier of the materials or even the manufacturer. In such circumstances, if the original supplier were
to provide us or our usual manufacturers with faulty materials, we might not be able to recover the costs of such materials or be compensated
for any damages that arise as a result of the inclusion of the faulty components in our products. 

One
or more of our usual manufacturers may suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems
in its manufacturing operations, or seek to terminate its relationship with us, or we may choose to change or add additional manufacturers
for other reasons. Additionally, we do not have long-term supply agreements with our usual manufacturers. As a result, we may be unable
to renew or extend our agreement on terms favorable to us, if at all. Although the manufacturing services required to manufacture and
assemble our products may be readily available from a number of established manufacturers, it may be risky, time consuming and costly
to qualify and implement new manufacturer relationships. 

Any
of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If
critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable,
then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which could damage
our business. 

In
order to produce our Optimus System and related safety systems, we obtain certain hardware components, as well as subsystems and
systems from a limited group of suppliers, some of which are sole source suppliers. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these
suppliers that obligate them to continue to sell components, subsystems, systems or products to us. Our reliance on these suppliers involves
significant risks and uncertainties, including whether our suppliers will provide an adequate supply of required components, subsystems,
or systems of sufficient quality, will increase prices for the components, subsystems or systems and will perform their obligations on
a timely basis. 

25 

In
addition, certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products and in our development programs, are periodically
subject to supply shortages, and our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Particularly,
the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand and a global shortage of semiconductors, creating substantial uncertainty
regarding our suppliers continued production of key components for our products. If any additional shortages occur and we are
unable to obtain components from third party suppliers in the quantities and of the quality that we require, on a timely basis and at
acceptable prices, then we may not be able to timely complete development programs or deliver our products on a timely or cost effective
basis to our customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with us, increase our costs and seriously harm our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or
unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate
alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience
significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other
costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We cannot
predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an affordable cost, if at all.
In particular, governmental measures responsive to the global COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted manufacturing and some supply chains,
including our supply chain, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses
and commerce worldwide. Although we have not yet seen significant delays from our suppliers and we keep stock of all our raw materials
and other product components with long lead times to assist in the event that our supply chain is disrupted, if the COVID-19 outbreak
continues and results in a prolonged period of commercial and/or governmental restrictions, this may impact our ability to obtain certain
raw materials and certain components used in the manufacture of our products and in our development programs. 

We
currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing which exposes us to fluctuations in component, materials and
equipment prices. Substantial increases in these prices would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results. 

Because
we currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing, we are subject to fluctuations in the prices of the raw
materials, parts and components and equipment we use in the production of our Optimus System . Substantial increases in the prices
for such raw materials, components and equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup
the increased costs through increased prices. Any attempts to increase prices of our automated data solutions in response to increased
costs could be viewed negatively by our customers and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating
results. 

We
may pursue additional strategic transactions in the future, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our
business profile significantly. 

We
intend to consider additional potential strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions of businesses or assets, joint ventures
or investments in businesses, products or technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current or future business.
We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties
to address particular market segments. Should our relationships fail to materialize into significant agreements, or should we fail to
work efficiently with these companies, we may lose sales and marketing opportunities and our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected. 

These
activities, if successful, create risks such as, among others: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired
with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our
ongoing business; (iv) potential unknown or unquantifiable liabilities associated with the target company; and (v) diversion of management s
attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (a) substantial investment of funds or financings
by issuance of debt or equity securities; (b) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration;
and (c) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses
and have the potential to either dilute the interests of our existing shareholders or result in the issuance of, or assumption of debt.
Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and
other resources. Any such activities may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed
to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access the capital markets on acceptable
terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure.
Our inability to take advantage of growth opportunities or address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses may
negatively affect our operating results. 

26 

Additionally,
any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated
with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings. Future acquisitions or joint ventures may not result
in their anticipated benefits, and we may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing
products and operations or successfully combine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of
those acquisitions. 

If
the Company is required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company s financial condition and results could
be negatively affected. 

Goodwill
impairment arises when there is deterioration in the capabilities of acquired assets to generate cash flows, and the fair value of the
goodwill dips below its book value. The Company is required to review its goodwill for impairment at least annually. Events that may
trigger goodwill impairment include deterioration in economic conditions, increased competition, loss of key personnel, and regulatory
action. Should any of these occur, an impairment of goodwill could have a negative effect on the assets of the Company. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the American Robotics
entity. Using a discounted cash flow analysis and revised forecasts for revenue and cash flows that are lower than the previous valuation,
it was determined that the fair value of the entity was lower than the carrying value as of December 31, 2022, and an impairment of 19,419,600
was recognized in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ending December 31, 2022. See Note 5 
Goodwill and Business Acquisition of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment
of goodwill. 

War,
terrorism, and other acts of violence may affect the markets in which we operate, our clients and our product and service delivery. 

Our
business may be adversely affected by regional or global instability, disruption or destruction, regardless of cause, including war,
terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. For example, the significant military action against Ukraine launched
by Russia may affect the markets in which we operate. Such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for
the products and services provided by us and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
These events pose risks which could materially adversely affect our financial results. 

We
may not be able to secure adequate insurance policies, or secure insurance policies at reasonable prices. 

We
maintain general liability insurance, aviation flight testing insurance, aircraft liability coverage, directors and officers insurance,
and other insurance policies and we believe our level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims.
However, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available
in the future at reasonable cost. Further, we expect our insurance needs and costs to increase as we grow our commercial operations and
expand into new markets and its uncertain if such insurance will be available on commercially reasonable terms. 

The
Company will be affected by operational risks and may not be adequately insured for certain risks. 

The
Company will be affected by a number of operational risks and the Company may not be adequately insured for certain risks, including:
labor disputes; catastrophic accidents; fires; blockades or other acts of social activism; changes in the regulatory environment; impact
of non-compliance with laws and regulations; natural phenomena, such as inclement weather conditions, floods, earthquakes and ground
movements. There is no assurance that the foregoing risks and hazards will not result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company s
technologies, personal injury or death, environmental damage, adverse impacts on the Company s operation, costs, monetary losses,
potential legal liability and adverse governmental action, any of which could have an adverse impact on the Company s future cash
flows, earnings and financial condition. Furthermore, the unmanned aerial systems industry lacks a formative insurance market. As a result,
the Company may be subject to or affected by liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which the Company cannot
insure or which the Company may elect not to insure because of the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could have an adverse impact
on the Company s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. 

27 

Litigation
may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

From
time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material
to our financial condition as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required.
The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a significant diversion of our resources, and there is no guarantee
that we will be able to successfully defend against any such litigation regardless of particular merits. There also may be adverse publicity
associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are
valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Insurance may not be available on favorable terms, at all, or in sufficient amounts
to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for
any claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of our operations. 

Our cash could be adversely
affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fail. 

The Company
maintains domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banks. The domestic bank deposit
balances may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. Also, in the foreign markets we serve, we also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks,
some of which are not insured or partially insured by the FDIC or other similar agency. These balances could be impacted if one or more
of the financial institutions in which we deposit monies fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets.
For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed and was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The Company held 361,813 in excess
of federally insured limits with Silicon Valley Bank as of March 10, 2023. However, on March 12, 2023, the federal government announced
they will back all customer deposits at Silicon Valley Bank. 

Risks
Related to Regulatory Requirements 

We
and our customers operate in a highly regulated business environment and changes in regulation could impose costs on us or make our products
less economical. 

Our
products and services and our utility customers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Laws and regulations
applicable to us and our products govern, among other things, the manner in which our products communicate, and the environmental impact
and electrical reliability of our products. Additionally, our critical infrastructure customers are often regulated by national, state
and/or local bodies, including public utility commissions, the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Federal
Aviation Administration, the FCC, Federal Rail Association, Israeli Defense Export Controls Agency of the Ministry of Defense and other
bodies. Prospective customers may be required to gain approval from any or all of these organizations prior to implementing our products
and services, including specific permissions related to the cost recovery of these systems. Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements
for implementation and operation of our products, which may result in unforeseen delays. We may incur material costs or liabilities in
complying with government regulations applicable to us or our utility customers. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could
be required in order to comply with evolving regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed on us or our utility customers
in the future. Such costs could make our products less economical and could impact our utility customers willingness to adopt
our products, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial condition. 

Furthermore,
changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect critical infrastructure industries could have a potentially adverse effect
on our customers interest or ability to implement our technologies. Many regulatory jurisdictions have implemented rules that
provide financial incentives for the implementation of energy efficiency and demand response technologies, often by providing rebates
or through the restructuring of utility rates. If these programs were to cease, or if they were restructured in a manner inconsistent
with the capabilities enabled by our products and services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly
harmed. 

Failure
to obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FAA or other governmental agencies, or limitations put on the use of small UAS in response
to public privacy and other concerns, may prevent us from expanding the sales of our drone solutions to industrial and government customers
in the United States. 

The
regulation of small UAS for commercial use in the United States is undergoing substantial change and the ultimate treatment is uncertain. 

28 

On
February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was enacted, establishing various deadlines for the FAA to allow
expanded use of small UAS for both public and commercial applications. On June 21, 2016, the FAA released its final rules regarding the
routine use of certain small UAS (under 55 pounds) in the U.S. National Airspace System pursuant to the act (the Part 107 Rules ).
The Part 107 Rules, which became effective in August 2016, provided safety regulations for small UAS conducting non-recreational operations
and contain various limitations and restrictions for such operations, including a requirement that operators keep UAS within visual-line-of-sight
and prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who are not directly participating in the operation of the UAS. On December
28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules requiring remote identification of drones and allowing operators of small drones to fly over
people and at night under certain conditions. On June 8, 2021, the FAA announced the formation of an Aviation Rulemaking Committee ARC to develop new rules to further define regulations for the operations of UAS Beyond Visual Line-of-Site BVLOS ). The timing
of additional rulemaking is uncertain as is the outcome of the still developing regulatory environment related to the operation of small
UAS. 

We
cannot assure you that any final rules enacted in furtherance of the FAA s announced proposals will result in the expanded use
of our drones and drone solutions by commercial and industrial entities. In addition, there exists public concern regarding the
privacy and other implications of U.S. commercial use of small UAS. This concern has included calls to develop explicit written policies
and procedures establishing usage limitations. We cannot assure you that the response from regulatory agencies, customers and privacy
advocates to these concerns will not delay or restrict the adoption of small UAS by the commercial use markets. 

Substantially
all our current products depend on the availability and are subject to the use of licensed radio frequencies regulated by the FCC in
the United States. 

Substantially
all of our current wireless networking products are designed to communicate wirelessly via licensed radio frequencies and therefore depend
on the availability of adequate radio spectrum in order to operate. It is possible that the FCC or the U.S. Congress could adopt additional
regulations or policies which are or may change or modify current regulations or policies so that they are, harmful to our business
or incompatible with our current or future product offerings, as well as products currently installed in the field. Additional regulations
or policies or changes or modifications to current regulations or policies may require modification or replacement of our products, including
products currently installed in the field, at significant, or even prohibitive, cost to us, and may require changes or modifications
to, or termination of, ongoing or planned projects. Any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
condition or results of operations. 

As
a manufacturer of commercial UAS, we are subject to various government regulations, restrictions and requirements, and may be subject
to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm, restrict or add costs to
our business. 

As
a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations, restrictions and requirements, including,
in the United States, those issued under the Consumer Products Safety Act, as well as those issued under product safety and consumer
protection statutes in our international markets. Failure to comply with any applicable product safety or consumer protection regulation
could result in sanctions that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Governments
and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety
and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection
regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials,
in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly,
increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expenses in the event any of our products were found to not comply
with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business. 

29 

Our
business is subject to federal, state and international laws regarding data protection, privacy, and information security, as well as
confidentiality obligations under various agreements, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could damage
our reputation, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business and operating results. 

In
connection with our business, we receive, collect, process and retain certain sensitive and confidential customer information. As a result,
we are subject to increasingly rigorous federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and data protection. Personal privacy,
data protection and information security are significant issues in the United States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products
and services. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain
for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government
agencies, including the United States Federal Trade Commission FTC and various state, local and foreign bodies and agencies.
We also execute confidentiality agreements with various parties under which we are required to protect their confidential information. 

The
United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution,
use and storage of personal information of individuals, including end-customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many
state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data.
Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, and other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have
laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating
within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations
may require companies to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information
stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some
cases, obtain individuals consent to use personal information for certain purposes. 

We
also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection
and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact of
such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became
effective in 2020, provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies. Additionally, we expect
that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted differently in the future. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding
the regulatory framework for the future of personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States with regulations such
as the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), which imposes more stringent E.U. data protection requirements,
provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations,
including the adoption of the GDPR, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations
could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products,
require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and
increase our revenue. 

Although
we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and
other legal obligations that apply to us, such laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted
and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal
obligations, our practices or the features of our products. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations,
industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, and our efforts to do so may cause us to incur significant costs
or require changes to our business practices, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any failure or perceived
failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal
obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release
or transfer of personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation,
fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our
reputation and business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable
laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and
liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results. 

30 

We
are subject to numerous legal and regulatory regimes, and we could be harmed by changes to, or the interpretation or the application
of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. 

In
addition to the United States, Airobotics operates in Israel, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The international scope of
Airobotics business requires us to comply with a wide range of national and local laws and regulations, which may in certain cases
diverge from or even conflict with each other. 

With
the geographic expansion of our business, and that of our subsidiaries, into new markets, we have become subject to additional and changing
legal, regulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards. 

In
countries where we operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new interpretations of existing laws and regulations
or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning our business. Changes in government regulation of or successful challenges to the
business model used by us in certain markets may require us to change our existing business models and operations. Any additional regulatory
scrutiny or changes in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for us to continue to operate
in all of the current markets or to expand in accordance with our strategy, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary
greatly or conflict between different operating countries. This may negatively impact our revenue and profitability by preventing our
business from reaching sufficient scale in particular markets or having to change our business model or incur additional costs, which
would adversely impact business. Our inability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead
to regulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable undertakings
and adversely affect our business. 

We may become subject to increasing global
trade laws and regulations. 

We
may become subject to increasing global trade laws and regulations, including economic sanctions, export controls, and import laws. Failure
to comply with global trade laws and regulations can result in penalties and reputational harm. Our international sales efforts expose
us to increased risk under these laws and regulations, and increasing and evolving global trade laws could impact our business. 

We
are subject to Israeli regulations, restrictions and requirements which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 

Restrictions
imposed on us by the Government of Israel, as a result of strategic ties and treaties with foreign countries, limit our activities and
access to certain countries, in a manner that may restrict and even prevent in certain situations our operations in certain countries
and affect its results. 

Risks
Related to our Intellectual Property 

Our
ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain. 

We rely
primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary
technologies and intellectual property. As of this filing, the Ondas Networks segment held a total of seven issued patents in the U.S.,
two issued international patents, four patent pending applications in the U.S., and eleven international pending patent application. The
Ondas Networks segment patents expire between 2028 and 2040, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents.
As of this filing, the Ondas Autonomous Systems segment held a total of six issued patents in the U.S., ten issued international patents,
six patent pending applications in the U.S., and eleven international pending patent applications. The Ondas Autonomous Systems segment
patents expire between 2036 and 2042, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. Our intellectual property
incorporates internally developed software and hardware design incorporating machine and computer vision and was developed with artificial
intelligence and machine learning techniques. This intellectual property is critical to the development of end-to-end systems which reliably
enable the automated operation of drones in real-world environments. 

We
have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products and processes. Currently, several of our issued
U.S. patents as well as various pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relate to our FullMAX systems and are therefore important
to the functionality of our products. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any jurisdiction, we may be precluded from doing
so at a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved in a timely manner or at all.
The rights granted to us under our patents, and the rights we are seeking to have granted in our pending patent applications, may not
be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage. In addition, those rights could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our
competitors, or be declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. The failure of our patents to adequately
protect our technology might make it easier or cheaper for our competitors to offer the same or similar products or technologies. Even
if we are successful in receiving patent protection for certain products and processes, our competitors may be able to design around
our patents or develop products that provide outcomes which are comparable or superior to ours without infringing on our intellectual
property rights. Due to differences between foreign and U.S. patent laws, our patented intellectual property rights may not receive the
same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Even if patents are granted outside the U.S., effective
enforcement in those countries may not be available without significant cost and time expense or at all. 

31 

We
rely on our trademarks and trade names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. Third parties may challenge
our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products,
which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote additional resources to marketing new brands. Further,
we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. 

We
also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protectable by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try
to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers,
employees, contractors and other service providers regarding our intellectual property and proprietary technology. In the event
of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of those agreements, we may not be provided with meaningful protection for our trade
secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by
competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, officers, employees, contractors and other service providers use
intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in the related or resulting know-how
and inventions. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other technologies not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently
developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

If
a competitor infringes upon one of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents, trademarks
and other rights may be costly, difficult and time consuming. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the industry in which we
operate is subject to rapid change and constant evolution and, consequently, patent positions in our industry can be uncertain. Even
if successful, litigation to defend our patents and trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could
be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient
resources or desire to defend our patents or trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation
also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally,
we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other
remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may harm our business, financial condition
and operating results. 

Our
business may suffer if it is alleged or found that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. 

Our
industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or
other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups have purchased patents and other
intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements from companies like ours.
To date we have received no claims with respect to our infringement of intellectual property or patents but, in the future, third parties
may claim that we are infringing upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be or may become contractually
obligated to indemnify our utility customers or other third parties that use or resell our products in the event our products are alleged
to infringe a third-party s intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming,
costly to defend in litigation, divert management s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and cause us to incur
significant expenses. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
Further, claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign affected products, delay affected product offerings,
enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting
us from marketing, selling or distributing the affected products. If we cannot or do not license the alleged infringed technology on
reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.
Additionally, our utility customers may not purchase our products if they are concerned that our products infringe third-party intellectual
property rights. This could reduce the market opportunity for the sale of our products and services. The occurrence of any of these events
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

32 

If
we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely
affected. 

In
addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented technology, trade secrets and know-how. We generally seek to protect this
information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our officers, employees, contractors and other
service providers and with parties with which we do business. These agreements may be breached, which breach may result in the misappropriation
of such information, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will
prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. 

Moreover,
our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our
officers, employees, contractors, other service providers, or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property
owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any
of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
use open-source software in our products and services that may subject our products and services to general release or require us to
re-engineer our products and services, which may cause harm to our business. 

We
use open-source software in connection with our products and services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open-source software
into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open-source software and/or compliance with open source license terms.
Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or noncompliance
with open-source licensing terms. Some open-source software licenses require users who distribute open-source software as part of their
software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open-source
code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software in our products and services and try to ensure
that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related product or that would otherwise breach
the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code,
pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our products, discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot
be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which
could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Intellectual
property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 

The
degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations,
and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative: 

others
 may be able to make devices that are the same as or similar to our remote radios but that are not covered by the claims of the patents
 that we own; 

we or any collaborators
 might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own; 

we might not have been
 the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions; 

others may independently
 develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; 

it is possible that our
 pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents; 

issued patents that we
 own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges; 

our competitors might conduct
 research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for
 certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information
 learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and 

we may not develop additional
 proprietary technologies that are patentable. 

33 

Risks
Related to our Financial Results 

We
will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitable operations. 

We
intend to increase our operating expenses substantially in connection with the planned expansion of our business, establishment of our
sales and marketing infrastructure, our ongoing research and development activities, and the commensurate development of our management
and administrative functions, but there is no guarantee that we will succeed in these endeavors. We will need to generate significant
sales to achieve profitability, and we might not be able to do so. Even if we do generate significant sales, we might not be able to
achieve, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our sales grow more slowly than we expect,
or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Our
future profitability may be dependent upon achieving cost reductions and projected economies of scale from increasing manufacturing quantities
of our products. Failing to achieve such reductions in manufacturing costs and projected economies of scale could materially adversely
affect our business. 

We
do not know whether or when we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable
us to manufacture (or contract for the manufacture of) these products in commercial quantities while meeting the volume, speed, quality,
price, engineering, design and production standards required to successfully market our products. Our failure to develop such manufacturing
processes and capabilities in locations that can efficiently service our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our future profitability is, in part, dependent upon achieving increased savings
from volume purchases of raw materials and component parts, achieving acceptable manufacturing yield and capitalizing on machinery efficiencies.
We expect our suppliers to experience a sharp increase in demand for their products. As a result, we may not have reliable access to
supplies that we require or be able to purchase such materials or components at cost effective prices. There is no assurance that we
will ever be in a position to realize any material, labor and machinery cost reductions associated with higher purchasing power and higher
production levels. Failure to achieve these cost reductions could adversely impact our business and financial results. 

If
business growth falls short of expectations, we may need to obtain additional capital to fund our growth, operations, and obligations. 

We
may require additional capital to fund our growth, operations, and obligations if our growth plan falls short or takes more time than
we anticipate. As our business has grown, we have managed periods of tight liquidity by accessing capital from our stockholders and their
affiliates. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including: 

our ability to enter into
 new agreements with customers or to extend the terms of our existing agreements with customers, and the terms of such agreements; 

the success of our sales
 efforts; 

our working capital requirements
 related to the costs of inventory and accounts receivable; 

costs of recruiting and
 retaining qualified personnel; 

expenditures and investments
 to implement our business strategy; and 

the identification and
 successful completion of acquisitions. 

34 

We
may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other
sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, when needed. For example,
increases in interest rates could negatively impact the costs of seeking additional funds through debt offerings and/or borrowings. If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the
growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our
revenue is not predictable and recognition of a significant portion of it will be deferred into future periods. 

Once
a customer decides to move forward with a large-scale deployment of our products and services, the timing of and our ability to recognize
related revenue will depend on several factors, some of which may not be under our control. These factors include shipment schedules
that may be delayed or subject to modification, the rate at which our utility customers choose to deploy our products in their network,
customer acceptance of all or any part of our products and services, our contractual commitments to provide new or enhanced functionality
at some point in the future, other contractual provisions such as liquidated damages, our suppliers ability to provide an adequate
supply of components, the requirement to obtain regulatory approval, and our ability to deliver quality products according to expected
schedules. In light of these factors, the application of complex revenue recognition rules to our products and services has required
us to defer, and in the future will likely continue to require us to defer, a significant amount of revenue until undetermined future
periods. It may be difficult to predict the amount of revenue that we will recognize in any given period and amounts recognized may fluctuate
significantly from one period to the next. 

Following
the completion of the acquisition of Airobotics, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increased. 

Airobotics
conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States, which also operate in their respective local currencies,
the most significant of which are currently the Israeli New Shekel, the Singapore Dollar and the Emirati Dirham. Therefore, following
the completion of the acquisition of Airobotics, our international operations accounts for a more significant portion of our overall
operations than they previously did and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increase. Because our financial
statements continue to be presented in U.S. dollars, the local currencies of Airobotics will be translated into U.S. dollars
at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation
risk. 

We
previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with the inadequate review of stock-based
compensation issued in connection with the acquisition of American Robotics, which has since been remediated, and we may identify material
weaknesses in the future . 

We
previously reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2021, associated
with the inadequate review of stock-based compensation issued in connection with the acquisition of American Robotics. A material weakness
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As
discussed in section entitled Controls and Procedures, we took a number of measures to remediate the material weakness
described above, and based on these measures, management has tested the internal control activities and found them to be effective and
has concluded that the material weakness described above has been remediated as of December 31, 2022. However, if additional material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control occur in the future, it may adversely affect our ability to report our
financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control
systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that
we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more new material
weaknesses, we may not assert that our internal controls are effective. If we cannot assert that our internal control over financial
reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a
material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and possibly impact our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms.
Additionally, our management s attention has been, and may further be, diverted from the operation of our business as a result
of the time and attention required to address the remediation of any material weakness in our internal controls. 

35 

Risks
Related to the Airobotics Transaction 

Our
business relationships, those of Airobotics or the combined company may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the
acquisition of Airobotics (the Airobotics Transaction ). 

Parties
with which we or Airobotics do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Airobotics Transaction, including with respect
to current or future business relationships with us, Airobotics, or the combined company. Our and Airobotics business relationships
may be subject to disruption, as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and others may seek to receive confirmation that their
existing business relationships with us or Airobotics, as the case may be, will not be adversely impacted as a result of the Airobotics
Transaction or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with
parties other than us, Airobotics, or the combined company as a result of the Airobotics Transaction. Any of these other disruptions
could have a material adverse effect on our or Airobotics business, financial condition, or results of operations or on the business,
financial condition, or results of operations of the combined company and could also have an adverse effect on our ability to realize
the anticipated benefits of the Airobotics Transaction. 

If
we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting following completion of the Airobotics Transaction,
we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decline. 

We
and Airobotics historically maintained separate internal control over financial reporting with different financial reporting processes
and different process control software. We are in the process of integrating our internal control over financial reporting with that
of Airobotics. We may encounter difficulties and unanticipated issues in combining our respective accounting systems due to the complexity
of the financial reporting processes. We may also identify errors or misstatements that could require audit adjustments. If we are unable
to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting following completion of the Airobotics Transaction, we
may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decline. 

Airobotics
may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time. 

After
the Airobotics Transaction, Airobotics is subject to certain past, current, and future liabilities. There could be unasserted claims
or assessments against or affecting Airobotics, including the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there
may be liabilities of Airobotics that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future,
including indemnification requests received from customers of Airobotics relating to claims of infringement or misappropriation of third
party intellectual property or other proprietary rights, tax liabilities arising in connection with ongoing or future tax audits and
liabilities in connection with other past, current and future legal claims and litigation. Any such liabilities, individually or in the
aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may learn additional information about Airobotics that adversely
affects us, such as unknown, unasserted, or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or infringement
or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights. 

Ondas
may experience difficulties integrating Airobotics business. 

Achieving
the anticipated benefits of the Airobotics Transaction will depend in significant part upon whether Ondas and successfully integrates
Airobotics and American Robotics in the Ondas Autonomous Systems in an efficient and effective manner. The actual integration and operations
of the Ondas Autonomous Systems may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan
may not be realized. The companies may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly, successfully or on a timely basis.
The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems of controls, and facilities and addressing possible differences
in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The companies operate
numerous systems and controls, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing,
employee benefits, payroll, and regulatory compliance. The integration of operations following the Airobotics Transaction will require
the dedication of significant management and external resources, which may temporarily distract management s attention from the
day-to-day business of the combined company and be costly. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may
also disrupt the business of the combined company. Any inability of management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of
the two companies could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company. 

36 

The
combined company may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Airobotics Transaction within the timing anticipated or at all. 

Ondas
and Airobotics entered into the Agreement of Merger, dated August 4, 2022, because each company believes that the Airobotics Transaction
will be beneficial to each of Ondas and Airobotics primarily as a result of the anticipated benefits resulting from the combined company s
operations. The companies may not be able to achieve the anticipated long-term strategic benefits of the Airobotics Transaction. An inability
to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the Airobotics Transaction, as well as any delays that may be encountered
in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such benefits, could have an adverse effect on the business and results of
operations of the combined company, and may affect the value of Ondas common stock after the completion of the Airobotics Transaction. 

The Airobotics Transaction
involved substantial costs. 

We
have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Airobotics Transaction. The substantial
majority of the non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction and regulatory costs related to the Airobotics Transaction. We will
also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including system consolidation costs
and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred
from the Airobotics Transaction and integration. Although we anticipate that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization
of other efficiencies and synergies related to the integration should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net
benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. 

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

We
have limited trading activity and as a result, the price of our common stock might fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or
part of your investment. 

The
limited trading activity and resulting volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your
shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares. The trading price of our common stock may be volatile and
subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations
 in our financial and operating results; 

adverse results from delays
 in our product development; 

legal, political, governmental
 or other regulatory developments, decisions or interpretations; 

publication of research
 reports or coverage about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations; 

perceptions about the market
 acceptance of our products and services, and the recognition of our brand; 

adverse publicity about
 our products and services, operating or financial results or industry in general; 

overall performance of
 the equity markets; 

introduction or discontinuation
 of products or services, or announcements of significant contracts, licenses or acquisitions, by us or our competitors; 

additions or departures
 of key personnel; 

threatened or actual litigation
 and government or regulatory investigations; 

sale of shares of our common
 stock by us or members of our management or our stockholders; and 

general economic conditions,
 both global and regional.

Our
common stock is listed on Nasdaq and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange TASE under the symbol ONDS. 
The first trading day of the Company s shares on TASE was January 26, 2023. There can be no assurance that trading of our common
stock on such market will be sustained. In the event that our common stock is not listed on Nasdaq or TASE, or if we do not sustain such
listing, our common stock could be quoted only on the OTC Markets. Under such circumstances, you may find it significantly more difficult
to trade, or to obtain accurate quotations for our common stock and our common stock may become substantially less attractive to certain
purchasers, such as financial institutions, hedge funds, and other similar investors. 

These
and other factors might cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate unpredictably and substantially, which may negatively
affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries,
including our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies.
Accordingly, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and
these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price. 

Securities
class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the
market price of a company s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our
management s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Concentration
of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors
from influencing significant corporate decisions. 

Our
executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5 or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the
aggregate, beneficially own approximately 15.6 of our outstanding common stock as of March 10, 2023, and as of the date of this
filing. As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder
approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets,
or other significant corporate transactions. 

Some
of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, they may be more interested in selling our company
to an acquirer than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders. 

We
may issue more shares to raise additional capital, which may result in substantial dilution. 

Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance
of a maximum of 116,666,667 shares of common stock. Any additional financings effected by us may result in the issuance of additional
securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders.
In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering, and investors
purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to purchases in this offering or other existing stockholders.
Also, we have reserved 6,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to future awards under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan. As
of December 31, 2022, the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan is 3,927,140
shares of common stock. The issuance of such additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common
stock, may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, if all or a substantial portion of these shares are resold into
the public markets then the trading price of our common stock may decline. 

Our
Board may issue and fix the terms of shares of our preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the voting
power of holders of our common stock or any change in control of our Company. 

Our
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred
stock, 0.0001 par value per share, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board.
Our Board is empowered, without the need to obtain stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation,
conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.
In the event of such issuances, the preferred stock could be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying
or preventing a change in control of our company. 

38 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price
and trading volume could decline. 

The
trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us or our business, which research and reports are not and would not be subject to our control. We currently do not have and may never
obtain research coverage by securities analysts, and industry analysts that currently cover us may cease to do so. If no securities analysts
commence coverage of our company, or if industry analysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be
materially and adversely impacted. In the event we obtain securities analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover
us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may be materially and adversely
impacted. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock
could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock nor are we under any obligation to declare or pay such cash dividends. We
currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our operations and the development and growth of our business, and we do not expect
to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be
limited by any future debt instruments or preferred securities. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in
our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases to a price above the price you paid for them and you sell such
shares. 

Our
shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules. 

The
SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized
for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions
in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If the price per share of our common stock continues to be is less than 5.00,
our common stock will continue to be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny
stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In
addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules,
a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
(i) the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions
involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have
the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty
selling their shares. 

Certain
provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada law make it more difficult for a third-party to
acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders best interest. 

Certain
provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada law make it more difficult for a third-party to
acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders interest. For example,
Nevada law provides that approval of two-thirds of the stockholders is required to remove a director, which may make it more difficult
for a third-party to gain control of the Company. This concentration of ownership limits the power to exercise control by our minority
stockholders. 

Our
bylaws designate the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada as the sole and exclusive forum for certain
actions, which could limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with
the Company and its directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. 

Unless
we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada
(the Court shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative
action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director,
officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against
the Company, any director or the Company s officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the NRS, Chapters 78 or 92A
of the NRS or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company,
any director or the Company s officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, each of these clauses (i)
through (iv) will not apply to any claim (x) as to which the Court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court within ten (10) days
following such determination), (y) for which the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (z) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court, including pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, which provides for exclusive
federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), provides for concurrent jurisdiction
for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder, and as such the exclusive jurisdiction clauses set forth above would not apply to such suits.

Overview 

Ondas
Holdings is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its wholly owned subsidiaries Ondas Networks
Inc. Ondas Networks ), American Robotics, Inc. American Robotics or AR and Airobotics, Ltd. Airobotics ). American Robotics and Airobotics are operated together, under a separate business unit called Ondas Autonomous
Systems. Ondas Holdings acquired American Robotics, a leading developer of highly automated commercial drone systems on August 5, 2021.
Ondas Holdings acquired Airobotics, an Israeli-based developer of autonomous drone systems on January 23, 2023. American Robotics and
Airobotics are operated together, under a separate business unit called Ondas Autonomous Systems. Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous
Systems together provide users in rail, energy, mining, agriculture, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets
with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas
Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems as separate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment. See Note 1 and
Note 2 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments. 

41 

Ondas
Networks Segment 

Ondas
Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to
these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things MC-IoT ). Our wireless networking products are applicable
to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications
require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such
applications are required in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and
public safety, homeland security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve
efficiency and ensure a high degree of safety and security. 

We
design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio SDR platform for secure,
licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area
network infrastructure. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE ),
the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16s standard. Because standards-based
communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we have taken a leadership position
in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports
the adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets. 

Our
software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks,
leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure
customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy
serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data
throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting
next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing
power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which
can be supported by the Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes
management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more
reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge. 

Our
Partnership with Siemens Mobility 

In
April 2020, Ondas Networks entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility Siemens ), a worldwide leader in
seamless, sustainable, reliable and secure transportation solutions for more than 160 years, to both market our FullMAX-based networking
technology and services and to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens 
Advanced Train Control System ATCS protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform. 

We
believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance across the global
rail market beginning with the North American Class I Railroad market. In the third quarter of 2021 we completed the development of our
first jointly-developed product with Siemens the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems. Siemens is now marketing and selling these
proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS radio systems support Siemens 
extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail
applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring,
Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity,
reduce costs and improve safety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under
the Siemens Airlink brand. 

Our
relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the wider marketing of our wireless
technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has expanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products
with identified opportunities in North American Transit Rail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology
has broad potential in these large, newly targeted markets. 

In
November 2021, Siemens secured its first commercial 900 MHz rail order for a major Class I Railroad in the United States which was delivered
in December 2021. In August 2022, we announced that we had secured an initial volume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz
Network consisting of both ATCS compatible products along with Ondas catalog products. In September 2022, we received government
authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada. 

42 

Additional
Critical Markets 

We
have launched additional initiatives to take our MC-IoT connectivity and ecosystem partnering strategy into other critical infrastructure
markets. In June 2022, we announced the first successful installation of our technology into an Integrated Coastal Surveillance System
(ICSS) in the Caribbean with a global defense contractor. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received and delivered on a new ICSS order
for the defense contractor to be deployed in India. We expect additional orders from this defense vendor for the ICSS application in
2023. We believe our FullMAX technology s licensed frequency flexibility, reliability, and long communications range over ocean surfaces,
is broadening the scale of our technology in this emerging market for homeland security. 

Ondas
Autonomous Systems Segment 

Our
Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit designs, develops, and markets commercial drone solutions via the Optimus System and Scout
System (the Autonomous Drone Platforms ). 

The
Autonomous Drone Platforms are highly automated, AI-powered drone systems capable of continuous, remote operation and are marketed as
 drone-in-a-box turnkey data solution services. They are deployed for critical industrial and government applications where
data and information collection and processing are required. These use cases include public safety, security and smart city deployments
where routine, high-resolution automated emergency response, mapping, surveying, and inspection services are highly valued, in addition
to industrial markets such as oil gas, rail and ports which emphasize security and inspection solutions. The Autonomous Drone Platforms
are typically provided to customers under a Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model, while some customers will choose to purchase and
own and operate an Optimus Systems . 

American
Robotics and Airobotics have industry leading regulatory successes which include having the first drone system approved by the Federal
Aviation Administration FAA for automated operation beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. 

In
addition to the Autonomous Drone Platforms, we also offer a counter-drone system called the Raider . The Raider was developed
by Iron Drone and is deployed by government and enterprise customers to provide security and protect critical infrastructure, assets
and people from the threat of hostile drones. Ondas Holdings acquired Iron Drone on March 6, 2023. 

Autonomous
Drone Platforms 

We design, develop and manufacture autonomous drone systems, providing
high-fidelity, ultra-high-resolution aerial data to enterprise and government customers. We currently prioritize the marketing of our
Optimus System which provides customers with a turnkey data and information solution and the ability to continuously digitize,
analyze, and monitor their assets and field operations in real-time or near real-time. We believe the market opportunity for our Scout
System remains significant. As we drive market adoption with the Optimus platform, we anticipate re-introducing the Scout platform
including newly enhanced versions to help segment the market for different use cases and price points. 

The
Optimus System has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the
real world. Powered by innovations in robotics automation, machine vision, edge computing, and AI. Once installed in the field at customer
locations, a fleet of connected Optimus Systems , which are often deployed as networked drone infrastructure, which we refer to
as Urban Drone Infrastructure, remains indefinitely positioned in an area of operation, automatically collecting and seamlessly delivering
data and information regularly and reliably. 

We
market the Optimus System under a DaaS business model, whereby our drone platform aggregates customer data and provides the data
analytics meeting customer requirements in return for an annual subscription fee. Some customers purchase Optimus Systems to own
and operate themselves. We also engage distributors to assist in the sales and marketing of our Optimus System in geographic markets
where its more cost effective to identify and service potential customers by engaging local third parties. These distribution agreements
can include joint ventures, where Ondas Autonomous Systems will provide technical expertise to support the joint venture partner in the
provision of aerial data services to customers. 

43 

The
Optimus System consists of (i) Optimus , a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads, (ii) the Airbase ,
a ruggedized weatherproof base station for housing, battery swapping, battery charging, payload swapping, data processing, and cloud
transfer, and (iii) Insightful , a secure web portal and API which enables remote interaction with the system, data, and resulting
analytics anywhere in the world. These major subsystems are connected via a host of supporting technologies. Airbase has internal
robotic systems that enable the automated swapping of batteries and payloads. Automated battery swapping allows for 24/7 operation of
Optimus as the Optimus drone can immediately be redeployed after returning to the dock for a battery swap. Similarly, the ability to
autonomously swap sensors and advanced payloads without human intervention allows for the Optimus System to provide multiple applications
and use cases from a single location. 

American
Robotics and Airobotics have industry leading regulatory successes which include having the first drone system approved by the FAA for
automated operation BVLOS without a human operator or visual observer on-site. American Robotics FAA approvals were enabled by
integrating a suite of proprietary technologies, including Detect-and-Avoid DAA and other proprietary intelligent safety
systems into its autonomous drone platform, which we plan to integrate into the Optimus System . Airobotics is in the advanced
stages of receiving approval for Type Certification TC from the FAA for the Optimus UAV. TC approval will enable expanded
operation for the Optimus System in the United States including flight operations in populated areas. 

The
Raider 

The
Raider is a counter-drone system, which was designed and developed by Iron Drone, that we are marketing to government and enterprise
customers who can utilize the system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of
hostile drones. A typical Raider deployment location would include sensitive locations such as borders, stadiums or schools, or
near critical assets such as power plants and military bases, and for high profile locations such as amusement parks or where public
events are held. 

The
Raider is designed to detect, track and intercept unauthorized, or hostile unmanned aircraft and is most often sold with three
small UAVs that are housed in a docking station. The Raider UAV has live video capability and a payload containing a net that can be
deployed to intercept a hostile drone. Upon detection of an unauthorized drone, one or more Raider UAVs can be autonomously deployed
at high speeds to track the unauthorized aircraft. If the unauthorized aircraft is deemed hostile, the Raider UAV can deploy the
netting to physically intercept the aircraft. A parachute integrated with the netting allows the intercepted drone to safely fall to
the ground for collection by our customer. 

COVID-19 

In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 was identified and has resulted in increased travel restrictions,
business disruptions and emergency quarantine measures across the world including the United States. 

The
Company s business, financial condition and results of operations were impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 as follows: 

sales and marketing efforts
 were disrupted as our business development team was unable to travel to visit customers and customers were unable to receive visitors
 for on-location meetings; 

field activity for testing
 and deploying our wireless systems was delayed due to the inability for our field service team to install and test equipment for
 our customers; 

supply chain disruptions
 led to component shortages and inefficiencies in and delays in producing and delivering equipment for certain purchase orders; and 

delays in fulfilling purchase
 orders reduced our cash flow from operations. 

The
Company expects its business, financial condition and results of operations will be impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2023,
primarily due to supply chain disruptions due to pandemic-related plant and port shutdowns, transportation delays, government actions
and other factors, which may be beyond our control. The global shortage of certain components such as semiconductor chips, strains on
production or extraction of raw materials, cost inflation, and labor and equipment shortages, could escalate in future quarters. Labor
shortages have led and may continue to lead to difficult conditions for hiring and retention of employees, and increased labor costs.
Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and remains an unknown risk for the foreseeable future. The extent to which the coronavirus
may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information
which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus. As a result, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the full extent
of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on its future business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the Company
were to experience any new impact to its operations or incur additional unanticipated costs and expenses as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, such operational delays and unanticipated costs and expenses there could be a further adverse impact on the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022 IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes a 15 Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax Corporate AMT for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the Corporate AMT to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. Additionally, the IRA imposes a 1 excise tax on net repurchases of stock by certain publicly traded corporations. The excise
tax is imposed on the value of the net stock repurchased or treated as repurchased. The new law will apply to stock repurchases occurring
after December 31, 2022. 

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we are
required to capitalize R D expenses for tax purposes and amortize over five years for domestic based expenses and fifteen years for
foreign expenses. Given our tax net operating loss carryforward position we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our
financial statements. 

American Robotics Acquisition 

Merger Agreement 

On May 17, 2021, the Company
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the AR Agreement with Drone Merger Sub I Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub I ), Drone Merger Sub II Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub II ), American Robotics, and Reese Mozer, solely in his capacity as the
representative of American Robotics Stockholders (as defined in the AR Agreement). American Robotics is a company focused on designing,
developing, and marketing industrial drone solutions for rugged, real-world environments. AR s Scout System is a highly automated,
AI-powered drone system capable of continuous, remote operation and is marketed as a drone-in-a-box turnkey data solution
service under a Robot-as-a-Service (RAAS) business model. The Scout System is the first drone system approved by the FAA for automated
operation beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. 

On August 5, 2021 (the AR
Closing Date ), the Company s stockholders approved the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock, including
shares of common stock underlying Warrants (as defined below), in connection with the acquisition of American Robotics. 

On the AR Closing Date, American
Robotics merged with and into Merger Sub I, with American Robotics continuing as the surviving entity, and American Robotics then subsequently
and immediately merged with and into Merger Sub II Merger II ), with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving entity and
as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Simultaneously with Merger II, Merger Sub II was renamed American Robotics, Inc. 

Pursuant to the AR Agreement,
American Robotics stockholders and certain service providers received (i) cash consideration in an amount equal to 7,500,000, less certain
indebtedness, transaction expenses and other expense amounts as described in the AR Agreement; (ii) 6,750,000 shares of the Company s
common stock (inclusive of 26 fractional shares paid in cash as set forth in the AR Agreement); (iii) warrants exercisable for 1,875,000
shares of the Company s common stock (the Warrants (inclusive of 24 fractional shares paid in cash and the equivalent
of Warrants for 309,320 shares representing the value of options exercisable for 211,038 shares issued under the Company s incentive
stock plan and reducing the aggregate amount of Warrants as set forth in the AR Agreement); and (iv) the cash release from the PPP Loan
Escrow Amount (as defined in the AR Agreement). Each of the Warrants entitle the holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of 7.89. Each of the Warrants shall be exercisable in three equal annual installments commencing on
the one-year anniversary of the AR Closing Date and shall have a term of ten years. 59,544 of the stock options were issued fully vested
to employees who did not exercise their American Robotics options prior to the AR Closing Date and had no ongoing service requirements
and were included in the purchase consideration. The remaining 151,494 stock options issued vest over four years and are contingent on
ongoing employment by the Company and are recorded as compensation expense over the service period. 

45 

Also on the AR Closing Date,
the Company entered into employment agreements and issued 1,375,000 restricted stock units RSUs) under the Company s incentive
stock plan to key members of American Robotics management. These RSUs vest in equal installments on the next three anniversaries
of the AR Closing Date and vesting is contingent on the individuals remaining employed by the Company. These RSUs are not included in
purchase consideration and are expensed ratably over the service period. They were valued at the closing market price on the AR Closing
Date. 

The Company s Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 include results of operations of American Robotics for the period from the AR
Closing Date to December 31, 2022.

The increase in operating
expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 2,974,000 in professional fees, of which approximately 2,100,000 related
to the Airobotics acquisition; an increase of 3,609,000 in facilities and other expenses including insurance due to increased operations
at American Robotics; an increase of approximately 2,448,000 in depreciation and amortization expense due to amortization of American
Robotics intangible assets and new lease and leasehold improvements in Waltham; and an increase of approximately 8,884,000 in R D
development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 to improve and expand the product offerings at American Robotics and Ondas Networks.
Travel and entertainment expenses increased by approximately 1,005,000, compared to 2021, due to new offsite operating locations for
American Robotics and Ondas Networks, as well as travel related to the Airobotics acquisition. Human resource costs increased by approximately
 12,911,000 in 2022 compared to 2021 due to increased headcount at both American Robotics and Ondas Networks, combined with an increase
of approximately 2,604,000 in stock-based compensation. In 2022, there was an impairment of Goodwill from the American Robotics acquisition
of approximately 19,420,000.

 176,000, amortization of debt discount of approximately 2,359,000, and amortization debt issuance costs of approximately 1,187,000
for the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, offset by approximately 536,000 due to the payoff of the Steward Capital note payable in the
second quarter of 2021. Other income decreased by approximately 668,000 to other expense of 76,127 during the year ended December 31,
2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the PPP loan forgiveness of 666,091 in 2021.

The principal use of cash
in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was to fund the Company s expenses primarily related to both sales
and marketing and research and development activities necessary to allow us to service and support customers, and expenses for professional
fees related to the acquisition of Airobotics. 

The increase in cash flows
used in operating activities of approximately 21,068,000 was primarily due to the increase in net loss of 58,218,000, of which approximately
 32,271,000 related to non-cash and credits, including goodwill impairment, amortization of debt discount, stock-based compensation, amortization
of intangibles assets, depreciation, retirement of assets and amortization of right of use asset, deferred income taxes and PPP Loan forgiveness.
This resulted in cash used of approximately 25,947,000. This was partially offset by changes operating assets and liabilities resulting
in a cash inflow of 4,879,000 primarily from changes in accounts receivable and accrued expenses. 

Cash flows used in investing
activities decreased by approximately 3,276,000. The year ended December 31, 2021, included the purchase of American Robotics, net of
cash acquired of 6,517,338 as well as a loan to American Robotics of 2,000,000 with no corresponding amounts in the current year. Investing
activities in 2022 included an increased investment in Dynam A.I., asset purchase of two companies, and the purchase of leasehold improvements
and other equipment at American Robotics. 

49 

The decrease in cash provided
by financing activities of approximately 8,003,000 was due to cash proceeds from the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, which provided
approximately 27,702,000, and the ATM Offering, which raised approximately 6,090,000, compared to the 2021 Public Offering which raised
approximately 47,524,000, and approximately 1,461,000 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants in 2021, partially
offset by repayment of the Steward Capital Loan in 2021 of approximately 7,124,000. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have incurred losses since
inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. On December 31, 2022, we had stockholders 
equity of approximately 58,223,000. On December 31, 2022, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately 15,147,000 and
short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately 14,901,000, net of debt discount and issuance costs of approximately 3,252,000. On
December 31, 2022, we had cash of approximately 29,775,000 and working capital of approximately 14,200,000. 

In June 2021, the Company
completed a registered public offering of its common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately 47,524,000. In October 2022, the
Company entered into a convertible debt agreement, which provided cash proceeds of approximately 27,660,000. Also in 2022, the Company
raised approximately 6,090,000 through the ATM Offering. We believe the funds raised in 2021 and 2022, the remaining fund availability
under the ATM Offering and 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes, in addition to growth in revenue expected as the Company executes its business
plan, will fund its operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of the accompanying financial statements. 

Our future capital
requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time
and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability
to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory
changes and overall economic conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to
successfully market and secure purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline
as well as new customers. We also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities,
including our planned research and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that
we will generate revenue and cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings
and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be
available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially
acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures
could be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers
an accounting estimate to be critical if: 

requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 

50 

We base our estimates and
judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, our beliefs of what could occur in the future, our observation of trends in the industry,
information provided by our customers and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most
critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments
in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense, income taxes, complex derivative financial instruments
and impairment of long-lived assets including intangible assets acquired in business combinations. 

Share-Based Compensation
Expense . We calculate share-based compensation expense for option awards Share-based Award(s) based on the estimated
grant/issue date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model Black-Scholes Model and recognize the
expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. The Black-Scholes Model requires the
use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting
period of the Share-based Award in determining the fair value of Share-based Awards. The expected term is based on the simplified
method. Under this method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual term
of the option award. As the Company does not yet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the Company has identified several public
entities of similar complexities and industry and calculates historical volatility based on the volatilities of these companies. Although
we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation expense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments
about future events, which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could
significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period. 

We recognize restricted stock
unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided. Compensation associated with shares of Common Stock
issued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees is recognized over the expected service period beginning on the measurement
date, which is generally the time the Company and the service provider enter into a commitment whereby the Company agrees to grant shares
in exchange for the services to be provided. 

Income Taxes . As part
of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes.
A current liability is recorded for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more-likely-than-not to be realized. Changes in
valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are
modified through translation, in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted. Where
a valuation allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets, any future change will be credited
or charged to income tax expense. See Note 13 - Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion related
to Tax Reform. 

The determination of our provision
for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. In the
ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In spite
of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain positions may
be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities. We determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect
to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax laws and regulations are subject
to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events
and rely on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could
be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities. 

51 

Complex Derivative Financial
Instruments . From time to time, we sell common stock, and we issue convertible debt, both with common stock purchase warrants, which
may include terms requiring conversion price or exercise price adjustments based on subsequent issuance of securities at prices lower
than those in the agreements of such securities. In these situations, the instruments may be accounted for as liabilities and recorded
at fair value each reporting period. Due to the complexity of the agreement, we use an outside expert to assist in providing the mark
to market fair valuation of the liabilities over the reporting periods in which the original agreement was in effect. It was determined
that a Binomial Lattice option pricing model using a Monte Carlo simulation would provide the most accuracy given all the potential variables
encompassing a future dilutive event. This model incorporated transaction assumptions such as our stock price, contractual terms, maturity,
risk free rates, as well as estimates about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior. Although we believe our estimates and
assumptions used to calculate the fair valuation liabilities and related expense were reasonable, these assumptions involved complex judgments
about future events, which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets . Carrying values of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, we determine
whether an impairment loss should be recognized by testing the applicable asset or asset group s carrying value for recoverability.
This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the eventual disposal
of the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity
and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, then
a loss is recorded for the difference between the assets fair value and respective carrying value. The fair value of the assets
is determined using an income approach based upon a forecast of all the expected discounted future net cash flows associated
with the subject assets. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions include: market size and growth, market share, projected
selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our estimates are based upon historical experience, commercial relationships, market
conditions and available external information about future trends. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2021, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued accounting standards update ASU 2021-04 Earnings Per Share
(Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges
of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options, to clarify and reduce diversity in an issuer s accounting for modifications
or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification
or exchange. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. The adoption of this pronouncement during the year ended December 31, 2022 had no impact on our accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

In August 2020, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ),
which simplifies an issuer s accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models that require separate
accounting for embedded conversion features. ASU 2020-06 also simplifies the settlement assessment that entities are required to perform
to determine whether a contract qualifies for equity classification and makes targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible
instruments and earnings-per-share (EPS) guidance. This update will be effective for the Company s fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities can elect to adopt the new guidance through either a
modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company has elected to adopt the standard
early using the modified retrospective method of transition with effect from January 1, 2022. At the time of adoption this did not have
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. However, ASU 2020-06 precluded the Company from having to record a derivative
liability for convertible notes entered into during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

In December 2019, the FASB
issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions for recognizing
deferred taxes for investments, performing intra-period tax allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. ASU 2019-12 is
applicable to all entities subject to income taxes. ASU 2019-12 provides guidance to minimize complexity in certain areas by introducing
a policy election to not allocate consolidated income taxes when a member of a consolidated tax return is not subject to income tax and
guides whether to relate a step-up tax basis to a business combination or separate transaction. ASU 2019-12 changes the current guidance
of making an intraperiod allocation, determining when a tax liability is recognized after a foreign entity investor transition to or from
equity method of accounting, accounting for tax law changes and year-to-date losses in interim periods, and determining how to apply income
tax guidance to franchise taxes. The amendments from ASU 2019-12 are effective for all public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2020 and include interim periods. The guidance is effective for all other entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2021 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this pronouncement
during the year ended December 31, 2021 had no impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Ondas Holdings Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Ondas Holdings Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Goodwill Impairment Evaluation 

As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the financial
statements, management conducts a goodwill impairment assessment annually at December 31, and when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined through
the use of the income approach using estimates of future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting units. As a result of the
annual impairment assessment, the Company recognized 19.4 million of goodwill impairment related to the American Robotics reporting unit. 

We identified the impairment of goodwill as a
critical audit matter because of significant judgments required by management to estimate the fair value of its Autonomous Solutions reporting
unit, including forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates and discount rate. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an
increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s cash flow estimates and
the selection of cash flow multiples used in the market approach. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the forecasts
of management s estimates of future cash flows, the selection of cash flow multiples for the Company s reporting units, and
the evaluation of the discount rate included the following, among others: 

We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of the
controls over the assessment of goodwill impairment, including those over the determination of fair value of the reporting unit. 

Tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and evaluated
significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company by performing procedures to test the projected revenues, projected
direct costs, projected operating expenses, and projected capital expenditures by comparing them with the historical forecasted results
of the respective reporting unit and assessing the impacts of internal and/or external economic factors. We also evaluated this information
by comparing the projections to information included in analyst reports, as well as industry outlook information. 

We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills
and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the discount rates used in the valuations.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.

having a maturity date of September 9, 2019 Tranche A ). The Agreement also included payments of in loan commitment fees and
 of the funding in loan facility charges. The loan commitment fees and in loan facility charges associated with Tranche
A were recorded as debt discount and amortized over the life of the Loan. There was also an end of term charge of . The end of
term charge was being recorded as accreted costs over the term of the Loan. The Note was secured by substantially all of the assets of
the Company. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company
was required to pay a loan facility charge. 

In connection with the waivers, extension and amendment, the Company agreed to pay to Steward Capital, upon the earlier of
(a) the completion of the public offering as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Agreement and (b) ten (10) days following the Company s
receipt of Steward s written demand therefor, a fee equal to three percent of the current outstanding principal balance of
the Loan (as defined in the Agreement), neither of which have occurred at the time of this filing. The Company concluded that the modifications
created by the First Amendment resulted in a troubled debt restructuring under Accounting Standard Codification Debt (Topic 470)
as it was determined that a concession was granted by Steward Capital. However, as the future payments to be made subsequent to the modification
were greater than the carrying value at the time of the modification, no gain or loss was required to be recognized on the troubled debt
restructuring. As the difference between the effective interest rate method and the straight-line method was deemed immaterial, the Company
continued to amortize the deferred loan costs using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the Loan.

in monthly installments beginning on November 1, 2022 through the maturity date of February 28, 2023 (each such date, an Installment

defined below) into shares of our common stock (an Installment Conversion ), subject to satisfaction of certain equity conditions,
including a minimum share price, minimum daily volume, and maintaining continued Nasdaq listing requirements among other
conditions. If these conditions are not met, installments can be requested in cash. In 2022, we issued common shares
as a result of Installment Conversion. At each Installment Date the note holder may defer some or all of the amount due until the subsequent
Installment Date. In between Installment Dates, the note holder also has the option to accelerate certain portions of principal due. At
each Installment Date the price used to exchange outstanding notes into common stock is based on an discount to the lowest volume weighted
average price VWAP of the respective previous five trading days. The maximum conversion price is per share.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management,
with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the period ended December 31, 2022 the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our senior management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board, senior management and
other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

54 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may
from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of
this evaluation, our senior management has concluded that the Company s controls over financial reporting were effective for the
period ending December 31, 2022, and the material weakness identified for the period ending December 31, 2021 has been remediated. 

Remediation of Material Weakness 

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
determined that the material weakness described below that was identified for the period ending December 31, 2021 was remediated during
the period ending December 31, 2022. 

Inadequate review of stock-
based compensation issued in connection with the acquisition of American Robotics 

The Company has completed
the remediation plan that includes the following: 

Implemented a third-party equity
management software to calculate stock compensation expense relating to all equity awards 

Restructured working papers
and added an additional review process to ensure that stock compensation expense is correctly calculated. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting 

Our assessment of internal
controls included American Robotics for the year ending December 31, 2022. It was excluded for the year ending December 31, 2021,
because it was the first year of the acquisition. 

Other than the matters set
forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant
to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the year ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs.

material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial
reporting.
