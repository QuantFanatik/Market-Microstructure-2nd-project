 The Company was founded over 90 years ago by Charles Revson, who revolutionized the cosmetics industry by introducing nail enamels matched to lipsticks in fashion colors. Today, the Company continues Revson's legacy by producing and marketing innovative products that address consumers' wants and needs for beauty and personal care products.

 Risks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases 
 
 a. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.

 d. The Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.

 o. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.

 b. The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products. Disruptions or delays at this facility and/or at other Company or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Risks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases 
 
 We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 Cases. 
 
 On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 21, 2023, the Debtors filed the Plan. Although the Plan is intended to effectuate a coordinated financial restructuring of the Company, and enjoys support from the Creditors Committee, the Consenting BrandCo Lenders, and the Consenting 2016 Lenders, it is impossible to predict with certainty the amount of time that the Company may spend in bankruptcy, or to assure parties in interest that the Plan will be confirmed or consummated and the timing of such confirmation and consummation. Even if confirmed on a timely basis, court proceedings to confirm the Plan could have an adverse effect on the Company s business. The proceedings also involve additional expense and may divert some of the attention of the Company s management away from business operations. For the duration of our Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan, as well as our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 bankruptcy. These risks include the following: 
 
 our ability to develop, obtain support for, confirm and consummate the Plan, another Chapter 11 plan or alternative restructuring transaction; 
 termination of the Restructuring Support Agreement, including due to our inability to meet the significant conditions and milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement, which may be difficult to satisfy; 
 termination of the Backstop Commitment Agreement and/or the Debt Commitment Letter and the potential incurrence of cash termination fees in connection therewith; 
 our ability to obtain and/or maintain timely approval by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to motions that we have filed or will file in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time; 
 our ability to operate within the restrictions and the liquidity limitations of the DIP Facilities and any related orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases; 
 our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence; 
 our ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, vendors, customers, employees, and other third parties; 
 our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations; 
 our ability to execute on our business plan during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases; 
 our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees; 
 the high costs of operating our business while in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and related fees; 
 the ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us; 
 the expiration, termination, or shortening of the exclusive period for us to propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan, whether caused by third parties or otherwise; 
 the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee or examiner or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; 
 the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans; and 
 uncertainties and continuing risks associated with our ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern. 
 
 Material delays in or other negative events during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases increase the risk of us being unable to reorganize our business and successfully emerge from bankruptcy and also increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process. 
 
 Material delays in or other negative events during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our creditors, suppliers, vendors, customers, employees, and other third parties, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with them. While we expect to continue normal operations, public perception of our continued viability may affect, among other things, the desire of new and existing customers, vendors, landlords, employees, or other parties to enter into or continue their agreements or arrangements with us. The failure to maintain any of these important relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of the public disclosure of the Chapter 11 Cases and concerns certain vendors may have about our liquidity, our ability to maintain normal credit terms with vendors may be impaired. 
 
 In addition, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may lead to delays and/or limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Also, the terms of the Final DIP Order and DIP Facilities may limit our ability to undertake certain business initiatives. Any material delays or other negative events during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases could increase the risks of us being 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 unable to reorganize our business and successfully emerge from bankruptcy. Additionally, any such material delays or other negative events during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases could increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process. 
 
 Operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for a long period of time may harm our business. 
 
 Our future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. A long period of operation under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort managing the Chapter 11 process rather than focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Chapter 11 protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. 
 
 Additionally, so long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, we will be required to incur significant costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases. We have obtained funding under the DIP Facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 975 million (consisting of (i) 575 million under the DIP Term Loan Facility and (ii) 400 million under the DIP ABL Facility (subject to a borrowing base limitation)), but this amount may prove insufficient to meet our costs under prolonged Chapter 11 proceedings. 
 
 Furthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11. 
 
 The Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business . 
 
 While we operate our businesses as debtors-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and, in some cases, certain lenders prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with creditors committees and other parties-in-interest and regularly scheduled hearings. Parties-in interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process may delay major transactions and limit our ability to respond quickly to opportunities and events in the marketplace. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe are beneficial to us. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, including the proposed Plan. 
 
 To emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to the plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan, which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays, including a delay in the Bankruptcy Court s commencement of the confirmation hearing regarding our proposed Plan (or any Chapter 11 plan). The confirmation hearing regarding our proposed Plan is currently scheduled to begin on April 3, 2023. 
 
 Though we have entered into the Restructuring Support Agreement with certain of our creditors to support our proposed Plan, we may not receive the requisite acceptances of constituencies in the Chapter 11 Cases to confirm the proposed Plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of our Plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm the Plan. Even if all voting classes vote in favor of the Plan or the Bankruptcy Code requirements for "cramdown" are met with respect to any class that voted to reject or was deemed to reject the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court, which may exercise its substantial discretion as a court of equity, may choose not to confirm the Plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims or subordinated or senior claims). If our proposed Plan (or any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization) is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims under a subsequent plan of reorganization (or liquidation). 
 
 Even if the proposed Plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied and, therefore, that a plan of reorganization will become effective and that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by a plan of reorganization. If emergence is delayed, we may not have sufficient cash available to operate our business. In that case, we may need new or additional post-petition financing, 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 which may increase the cost of consummating a plan of reorganization. There can be no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays to the Chapter 11 Cases. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases. If we are unable to successfully reorganize, we may not be able to continue our operations. 
 
 Further, although we have obtained commitments from our creditors to backstop the exit financing contemplated in the Restructuring Support Agreement and Plan, the Backstop Commitment Agreement and/or Debt Commitment Letter may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events. In those circumstances, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain alternative commitments to support the exit financing as proposed in the Plan, or obtain any exit financing at all. Even if we are able to obtain exit financing, there is no guarantee that such financing will be on as favorable terms as the Backstop Commitment Agreement and Debt Commitment Letter. Inability to raise exit financing on similar terms to the Backstop Commitment Agreement and Debt Commitment Letter may create risk to our ability to successfully reorganize. For additional information on the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Plan, the Backstop Commitment Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter, see Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 
 The Plan may not satisfy the requirements for non-consensual confirmation of a chapter 11 plan under the Bankruptcy Code. 
 
 In the event that any impaired class of claims does not accept or is deemed not to accept the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court may nevertheless confirm the Plan at the Debtors request if at least one impaired class has accepted the Plan (with such acceptance being determined without including the vote of any insider in such class), and as to each impaired class that has not accepted the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court determines that the Plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to the dissenting impaired classes. Since certain classes are deemed to reject the Plan, regardless of whether any voting classes reject the Plan, the requirements for non-consensual confirmation must be satisfied with respect to rejecting classes. While the Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies the requirements for non-consensual confirmation, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion. If the Bankruptcy Court does not find that the Plan satisfies the requirements for non-consensual confirmation, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm the Plan. 
 
 We may seek to amend, waive, modify, or withdraw the Plan at any time before confirmation. 
 
 Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Backstop Commitment Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter, we reserve the right, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, to amend or modify the Plan before the entry of the confirmation order or waive any conditions thereto if and to the extent such amendments or waivers are necessary or desirable to consummate the Plan. The potential impact of any such amendment or waiver on the holders of claims and interests cannot presently be foreseen but may include a change in the economic impact of the Plan on some or all of the proposed classes or a change in the relative rights of such classes. All holders of claims and interests will receive notice of such amendments or waivers required by applicable law and the Bankruptcy Court. If we seek to modify the Plan after receiving sufficient acceptances but before the Bankruptcy Court s entry of an order confirming the Plan, the previously solicited acceptances will be valid only if (i) all classes of adversely affected holders accept the modification in writing or (ii) the Bankruptcy Court determines, after notice to designated parties, that such modification was de minimis or purely technical or otherwise did not adversely change the treatment of holders of accepting claims or interests, or is otherwise permitted by the Bankruptcy Code. 
 
 We cannot make any assurances that the conditions precedent to the Plan s effectiveness will occur or be waived by the effective date. 
 
 Even if the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, there can be no assurance as to the timing of the effective date of the Plan. If the conditions precedent to the effective date set forth in the Plan do not occur or are not waived as set forth in the Plan, then any order entered by the Bankruptcy Court confirming the Plan may be vacated, in which event no distributions would be made under the Plan, the Debtors and all holders of claims and interests would be restored to the status quo ante as of the day immediately preceding the confirmation date, and the Debtors obligations with respect to claims and interests would remain unchanged. Notably, the conditions precedent set forth in Article XI of the Plan include the requirement that the Debtors obtain all authorizations, consents, regulatory approvals, or rulings that are necessary to implement and effectuate a Plan. Moreover, absent an extension, the Restructuring Support Agreement may be terminated by the Required Consenting BrandCo Lenders if the effective date does not occur by April 28, 2023.

 The Restructuring Support Agreement, Backstop Commitment Agreement, and/or the Debt Commitment Letter may be terminated, which could adversely affect the Company's Chapter 11 Cases. 
 
 The Restructuring Support Agreement contains provisions that give one or more of the Consenting Creditor Parties the ability to terminate the Restructuring Support Agreement if certain conditions are not satisfied or waived, including the failure to achieve certain milestones. Similarly, the Backstop Commitment Agreement and Debt Commitment Letter contain provisions that give the Equity Commitment Parties and the Debt Commitment Parties, as applicable, the ability to terminate their obligations to fully backstop the Equity Rights Offering, or the ability to terminate their commitment to provide the Incremental New Money Facility, as applicable, upon the occurrence of certain events or if certain conditions are not satisfied. Termination of the Restructuring Support Agreement, Backstop Commitment Agreement, and/or Debt Commitment Letter could result in protracted Chapter 11 Cases, which could significantly and detrimentally impact the Debtors relationships with vendors, employees, and major customers, or potentially the conversion of the Chapter 11 Cases into cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code Chapter 7 ). For additional information on the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Backstop Commitment Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter, see Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 
 The Restructuring is subject to conditions and milestones that we may be unable to satisfy. 
 
 There are certain material conditions we must satisfy under the Restructuring Support Agreement, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 Cases, which include the confirmation of the Plan and the consummation of the restructuring transactions thereunder. The satisfaction of such conditions is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 Termination of our exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances could result in competing plans of reorganization, which could have less favorable terms or result in significant litigation and expenses. 
 
 We currently have the exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan through and including May 9, 2023, and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances of any such plan through May 9, 2023. Such deadlines may be extended from time to time by the Bankruptcy Court for cause (as permitted by 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) until the dates 18 months and 20 months after the date we filed the Chapter 11 Cases, respectively. However, it is possible that (i) parties in interest could seek to shorten or terminate such exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods for cause (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code)) or (ii) that such periods could expire without extension prior to confirmation and consummation of the Plan. 
 
 If our exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods expire or are terminated, other parties in interest will be permitted to file alternative plans of reorganization. There can be no assurances that recoveries under any such alternative plan would be as favorable to creditors as the Plan. In addition, the proposal of competing plans of reorganization may entail significant litigation and significantly increase the expenses of administration of the Debtors' cases, which could deplete creditor recoveries under any plan. 
 
 We may fail to obtain the proceeds of the Exit Facilities or the Equity Rights Offering, which would adversely affect our ability to consummate the Plan. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will receive any or all of the proceeds of the Exit Facilities and the Equity Rights Offering. Because final documentation relating to the Exit Facilities has not yet been executed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the proceeds of the Exit Facilities. In addition, and notwithstanding the Backstop Commitment Agreement applicable to the Equity Rights Offering, because the Equity Rights Offering has not yet been completed, there can be no assurance that the Debtors will receive any or all of the proceeds of the Equity Rights Offering. If the Debtors do not receive the proceeds of the Exit Facilities and the Equity Rights Offering, the Debtors will not be able to consummate the Plan in its current form. 
 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time. 
 
 We face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 Cases and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, we must comply with the covenants of our DIP Facilities and other agreements associated therewith in order to continue to access our borrowings thereunder. We cannot assure you that cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the DIP Facilities will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 Our liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of our DIP Facilities and associated agreements; (ii) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases; (iii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand; (iv) our ability to generate cash flow from operations; (v) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction; and (vi) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 
 As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends. 
 
 During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the Petition Date. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, due to, among other things, revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date. Such value may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends. 
 
 We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 
 As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees have faced, and likely will continue to face, considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases may be limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. On July 25, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court approved a key employee retention program for key non-insider employees. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and other employees could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our post-bankruptcy capital structure has yet to be implemented, and any changes to our capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders, including holders of our Class A Common Stock. 
 
 Our proposed post-bankruptcy capital structure will be set pursuant to the Plan that requires Bankruptcy Court approval. The reorganization of our capital structure may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for our existing debt, equity securities, and claims against us. Such new debt may be issued at different interest rates, payment schedules and maturities than our existing debt securities. 
 
 If our proposed Plan is approved by the Bankruptcy Court, existing securities, including our Class A Common Stock, will be cancelled without receiving any distribution. The success of a reorganization through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to agree to the exchange or modification, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and there can be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, holders of our debt or of claims against us may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or may be modified or replaced by debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities and reduced interest rates. Holders of our Class A Common Stock may also find that their holdings no longer have any value and face highly uncertain or no recoveries under a plan. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance. If existing debt or equity holders are adversely affected by a reorganization, it may adversely affect our ability to issue new debt or equity in the future. Although we cannot predict how the claims and interests of stakeholders in the Chapter 11 Cases, including holders of Class A Common Stock, will ultimately be resolved, we expect that Class A common stockholders will not receive a recovery through any plan of reorganization unless the holders of more senior claims and interests, such as secured and unsecured indebtedness (which is currently trading at a significant discount), are paid in full. Consequently, there is a significant risk that the holders of our Class A Common Stock would receive no recovery under the plan of reorganization and that our Class A Common Stock will be worthless.

 The Plan is based upon assumptions that we developed that may prove incorrect and could render the Plan unsuccessful. 
 
 The Plan and the restructuring transactions contemplated thereby reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, management s plans, and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. The feasibility of the Plan for confirmation purposes under the Bankruptcy Code relies on financial projections we developed in connection with developing our business plan, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, debt service, and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. 
 
 Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the ability to maintain customers confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (ii) the ability to retain key employees; and (iii) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions in the United States and in the specific markets in which we currently do business. The failure of any of these factors could not only vitiate the projections and analyses that informed the Plan, but also otherwise materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses. 
 
 We expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ, perhaps materially, from what was anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by the Plan (or any other plan of reorganization we may implement) will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of the Plan. 
 
 The allowed amount of claims and the estimated percentage of recoveries set forth in the proposed Disclosure Statement may differ from current estimates. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the estimated claim amounts set forth in the proposed Disclosure Statement are correct, and the actual amount of allowed claims may differ materially from the estimates. There can be no assurance that the allowed amount of claims in Classes 9(a) (talc personal injury claims), 9(b) (non-qualified pension claims), 9(c) (trade claims), and 9(d) (other general unsecured claims) will not be significantly more than currently estimated, which, in turn could cause the estimated value of distributions to be reduced substantially. The estimated amounts are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the actual amount of allowed claims may vary materially from those estimated in the proposed Disclosure Statement. 
 
 Furthermore, although the Claims Bar Date (as defined below) has passed, on March 7, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending the Claims Bar Date for claimants alleging harm from the Company s chemical hair straightening/hair relaxer products (such claimants, the Hair Relaxer Claimants to April 11, 2023 for such claimants. To be entitled to vote on the Plan, Hair Relaxer Claimants must file a simplified proof of claim online by March 23, 2023. As a result, we anticipate that numerous additional personal injury claims will be filed against the Debtors relating to chemical hair straighteners and/or hair relaxer products. If additional claims are filed, the recovery for each allowed claim in Class 9(d) (other general unsecured claims) may be reduced. 
 
 Parties-in-Interest may object to our classification of claims and interests. 
 
 Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan may place a claim or an equity interest in a particular class only if such claim or equity interest is substantially similar to the other claims or equity interests in such class. We believe that the classification of claims and interests under the Plan complies with the requirements set forth in the Bankruptcy Code because we created classes of claims and interests, each encompassing claims or interests, as applicable, that are substantially similar to the other claims or interests in each such class. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion. 
 
 The consenting unsecured noteholder recovery in the Plan may not be approved. 
 
 The Plan provides that if Class 8 (unsecured notes claims) does not accept the Plan, holders of such claims that vote to accept the Plan on account of their claim and do not, directly or indirectly, object to, or otherwise impede, delay, or interfere with, solicitation, acceptance, confirmation, or consummation of the Plan, will receive the Consenting Unsecured Noteholder Recovery (as defined in the Plan), unless the Bankruptcy Court finds that such Consenting Unsecured Noteholder Recovery is improper. The Consenting Unsecured Noteholder Recovery may be subject to substantial challenges, including on the basis that it provides unequal treatment within Class 8 pursuant to section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, or is other otherwise impermissible under applicable bankruptcy law. If the Bankruptcy Court were to sustain any such challenge, consenting 
 23

 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 unsecured noteholders would not be eligible to receive the Consenting Unsecured Noteholder Recovery. As such, members of Class 8 should not rely on the Consenting Unsecured Noteholder Recovery in making a decision to vote to accept the Plan. 
 
 Releases, injunctions and exculpations in the Plan may not be approved. 
 
 Article X of the Plan provides for certain releases, injunctions, and exculpations, including a release of liens and causes of action that may otherwise be asserted against the Debtors, Reorganized Holdings, or released parties, as applicable. The releases, injunctions, and exculpations provided in the Plan are subject to objection by parties and may not be approved. If the releases, injunctions, and exculpations are not approved, certain released parties may withdraw their support for the Plan. The releases provided to the released parties and the exculpation provided to the exculpated parties are necessary to the success of the Debtors reorganization because the released parties and exculpated parties have made significant contributions to the Debtors reorganization efforts and have agreed to make further contributions, including by agreeing to convert certain of their claims against the Debtors estates into equity in Reorganized Holdings, but only if they receive the full benefit of the Plan s release and exculpation provisions. The Plan s release and exculpation provisions are an inextricable component of the Restructuring Support Agreement and the significant deleveraging and financial benefits embodied in the Plan. 
 
 In certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, in which case our Class A Common Stock would likely be worthless. 
 
 There can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases. If the Bankruptcy Court finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or the Debtors, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Debtors assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan or reorganization because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner the Debtors businesses as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations. We believe our Class A Common Stock would receive no distribution if the Chapter 11 Cases were converted to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under the Plan, our Class A Common Stock will be cancelled without receiving any distribution. As a result, in either scenario, it is likely that our Class A Common Stock is worthless. 
 
 The Chapter 11 Cases are expected to render our Class A Common Stock worthless. 
 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that is senior to the Company s existing shares of Class A Common Stock in our capital structure. Recoveries in the Chapter 11 Cases for holders of Class A Common Stock, if any, will depend upon our ability to confirm the Plan (or another Chapter 11 plan), the terms of such plan, the performance of our business, the value of our assets and other factors. Under the proposed Plan, our Class A Common Stock will be cancelled without receiving any distribution. The Class A common stockholders will not receive any recovery unless the holders of more senior claims and interests, such as secured and unsecured indebtedness (which are not expected to recover in full under the Plan), are paid in full. Consequently, we expect that our Class A Common Stock will become worthless. 
 
 Trading in shares of our Class A Common Stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and we expect that you will lose your investment. 
 
 The price of our Class A Common Stock has been volatile following the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. As described above, we expect that the Class A Common Stock will be worthless under the Plan. Accordingly, any trading in our Class A Common Stock during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our Class A Common Stock. Furthermore, we have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in our Class A Common Stock that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our Company and/or macro-industry and macroeconomic trends. These price and volume fluctuations have been due in large part to trading activity by retail investors and/or short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further increasing volatility in its market price. These and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of an active trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our Class A Common Stock when desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A Common Stock. 
 
 The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund our business operations, or may be unavailable to us if we do not comply with certain covenants. 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

There can be no assurance that the revenue generated by our business operations and the cash made available to us under the DIP Facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on terms that are acceptable to us or the Bankruptcy Court. If, for one or more reasons, we need to and are unable to obtain such additional financing, our business and assets may be subject to liquidation under Chapter 7 and we may cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The DIP Facilities include affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us, including milestones related to the progress of the Chapter 11 Cases and compliance with a budget and maintenance of certain minimum liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants and meet our obligations as they become due or to comply with the other terms and conditions of the DIP Facilities. Any event of default under the DIP Facilities could imperil our ability to reorganize. 
 
 Additionally, limits on Products Corporation s borrowing capacity under the DIP ABL Facility may affect our ability to finance our operations. At December 31, 2022, Products Corporation had 171.8 million in aggregate borrowings outstanding under the DIP ABL Facility. While the DIP ABL Facility provides for up to 270 million of revolving commitments, the Company s ability to borrow funds under such facility is limited by a borrowing base determined relative to the value, from time-to-time, of certain eligible assets. Under the DIP ABL Facility, if the value of the Company's eligible assets is not sufficient to support the full borrowing base under the facility, Products Corporation will not have complete access to the entire commitment available under the facility, but rather would have access to a lesser amount as determined by the borrowing base. The applicable borrowers must prepay loans under the DIP ABL Facility to the extent that outstanding loans exceed its borrowing base. 
 
 As Products Corporation continues to manage its working capital (including its and its subsidiaries inventory and accounts receivable, which are significant components of the eligible assets comprising the borrowing base under the DIP ABL Facility), this could reduce the borrowing base under the DIP ABL Facility. Further, if Products Corporation borrows funds under the DIP ABL Facility, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base could require Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base. 
 
 If one or more lenders under the DIP ABL Facility are unable to fulfill their commitment to advance funds to Products Corporation under such facility, it would impact the Company s liquidity and, depending upon the amount involved and the Company s liquidity requirements, it could have an adverse effect on the Company s ability to fund its operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Recently, the Company s working capital and borrowing base availability under the DIP ABL Facility has been negatively impacted by global supply chain issues which have affected the Company s accounts receivable and inventory. These global supply chain issues have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic headwinds, and have led to the unavailability of raw materials and cost increases in raw materials, labor and transportation. Although the Company has taken actions to increase its liquidity, these global supply chain issues and other developments that may negatively affect the Company s liquidity, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, may continue or recur in the future. Actions previously taken by the Company to address these issues, such as cost cutting, may have a negative effect on the future business and results of operations of the Company. There can be no assurance that these global supply chain issues and other developments will not impact the Company s liquidity in the future. If the Company is unable to finance its business on either a short-term or long-term basis due to a decrease in borrowing capacity or liquidity, it could result in a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 , the Company had a liquidity position of 308.3 million, consisting of: (i) 249.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately 94.6 million held outside the U.S.) ; (ii) 60.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the DIP ABL Facility (which had 41.8 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately 1.4 million of outstanding checks. See Note 8, Debt, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and Recent Debt Transactions in Item 7. Combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 the DIP Term Loan Facility and/or the DIP ABL Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company currently expects that operating revenues, cash on hand, and funds that may be available for borrowing under the DIP ABL Facility and other permissible borrowings will be sufficient to enable the Company to cover its operating expenses for the first half of 2023, including: cash requirements for the payment of expenses in connection with executing the Company's business initiatives and its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs (including, without limitation, the 2018 Optimization Progr am and the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program subsequently renamed during 2021 as RGGA, as hereinafter defined)) ; sever ance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade. See Note 8, Debt, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 2022 10-K and Recent Debt Transactions in Item 7. Combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 However, if the Company's anticipated level of revenue is not achieved because of, for example, decreased consumer spending in response to challenging economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, such as due to the consumption declines in core beauty categories in the mass retail channel in North America; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, those for pension expense under its benefit plans, capital expenditures, restructuring and severance costs (including, without limitation, for the 2018 Optimization Program and the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (subsequently renamed during 2021 as RGGA) ), a cquisition and integration costs, costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet its cash requirements. In addition, such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and could have a material adverse effect on the DIP Facilities (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - "The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund our business operations, or may be unavailable to us if we do not comply with certain covenants," which discusses, among other things, the consequences of noncompliance with Products Corporation's debt covenants under the DIP Facilities). 
 
 If the Company's operating revenues, cash on hand and/or funds that may be available for borrowing are insufficient to cover the Company's expenses and/or are insufficient to enable Products Corporation to comply with the requirements of the DIP Facilities, the Company could be required to adopt one or more of the alternatives listed below: 
 
 delaying the implementation of or revising certain aspects of the Company's business initiatives; 
 reducing or delaying purchases of wall displays and/or expenses related to the Company's advertising, promotional and/or marketing activities; 
 reducing or delaying capital spending; 
 implementing new restructuring programs; 
 refinancing Products Corporation's indebtedness; 
 selling assets or operations; 
 seeking additional capital contributions and/or loans from MacAndrews Forbes, the Company's other affiliates and/or third parties; and/or 
 reducing other discretionary spending. 
 
 The Company may not be able to take any of these actions because of a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in one or more of Products Corporation's various debt instruments, including, for example, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of one or more of Products Corporation's various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the 
 26

 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions. If the Company is required to take any of these actions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Such actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements or enable Products Corporation and its subsidiaries to comply with the terms of the DIP Facilities if the actions do not result in sufficient c ost reductions or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be. (See also Item "Risk Factors - "The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund our business operations, or may be unavailable to us if we do not comply with certain covenants," which discusses, among other things, the consequences of noncompliance with Products Corporation's debt covenants under the DIP Facilities). 
 
 Risks Related to Securities to be Issued Under the Plan Generally 
 
 There is no public market for the securities to be issued under the Plan. 
 
 If the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Reorganized Holdings is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a privately held company and its outstanding equity is expected to be cancelled. There will be no public market for the new common stock (the New Common Stock or new warrants (the New Warrants to be issued under the Plan and there can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for the New Common Stock, or New Warrants, or that such securities will be listed upon any national securities exchange or any over-the-counter market after the effective date. If a trading market does not develop, is not maintained, or remains inactive, holders of the New Common Stock and New Warrants may experience difficulty in reselling such securities or may be unable to sell them at all. Even if such a market were to exist, the price of such securities will depend upon many factors, including, without limitation, prevailing interest rates, markets for similar securities, industry conditions, and the performance of, and investor expectations for, Reorganized Holdings. Furthermore, persons to whom the New Common Stock or New Warrants are issued pursuant to the Plan may prefer to liquidate their investments rather than hold such securities on a long-term basis. Accordingly, the market price for such securities could decline and any market that does develop for such securities may be volatile. 
 
 The securities to be issued under the Plan will be subject to dilution. 
 
 The ownership percentage represented by the New Common Stock distributed on the effective date under the Plan will be subject to dilution from the equity issued in connection with the (i) Equity Rights Offering (including the Backstop Commitment Premium (as defined in this 2022 Form 10-K)), (ii) the management incentive plan, (iii) the exercise of the New Warrants, (iv) other post-emergence issuances and (v) the conversion of any options, warrants, convertible securities, exercisable securities, or other securities that may be issued post-emergence. 
 
 No dividends will be paid on the securities to be issued under the Plan. 
 
 Reorganized Holdings does not anticipate paying any dividends on the New Common Stock as it expects to retain any future cash flows for debt reduction and to support its operations. In addition, covenants in the documents governing Reorganized Holdings indebtedness may restrict its ability to pay cash dividends and may prohibit the payment of dividends and certain other payments. As a result, the success of an investment in the New Common Stock (including the New Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the New Warrants) will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in the value of the New Common Stock. There is, however, no guarantee that the New Common Stock will appreciate in value or even maintain its initial value. 
 
 The New Common Stock and New Warrants to be issued under the Plan will be subordinated to the indebtedness of Reorganized Holdings. 
 
 In any future liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of Reorganized Holdings, the New Common Stock and the New Warrants will rank below all debt claims against Reorganized Holdings including claims under the definitive documents pertaining to the Exit Facilities (the "Exit Facilities Documents"). Therefore, holders of the New Common Stock and/or the New Warrants will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of Reorganized Holdings until after all Reorganized Holdings obligations to its debt holders have been satisfied. 
 
 The ownership of the New Common Stock and/or New Warrants may be concentrated. 
 
 Certain holders of allowed claims are expected to acquire a significant ownership interest in the New Common Stock and/or New Warrants pursuant to the Plan. If such holders were to act as a group, such holders would be in a position to control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, without the approval of other 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 stockholders. This concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder a negotiated change of control of Reorganized Holdings and, consequently, have an impact upon the value of the New Common Stock and/or New Warrants. 
 
 Risks Related to Reorganized Holdings 
 
 We may be subject to claims that may not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Reorganized Holdings. 
 
 The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. The Company currently faces the potential for numerous products liability claims brought by the Hair Relaxer Claimants. In late January, these claimants filed various motions seeking to extend the Claims Bar Date for such claims, or, in the alternative, leave to file late proofs of claims. On March 6, 2023, the Debtors filed a statement in response to these motions, which included a proposal to extend the Claims Bar Date for Hair Relaxer Claimants. On March 7, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court approved the relief sought in the Debtors response and entered an order extending the Claims Bar Date for Hair Relaxer Claimants to April 11, 2023. To be entitled to vote on the Plan, Hair Relaxer Claimants must file a simplified proof of claim by March 23, 2023. The Company believes that the claims raised by the Hair Relaxer Claimants are dischargeable and without merit. The Company is not currently aware of any material claims against a Debtor that would not be discharged in the Chapter 11 cases, however, any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against Reorganized Holdings and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis. 
 
 Upon emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, future liability claims could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of Reorganized Holdings. 
 
 Parties may assert in the future certain liability claims, including, but not limited to, claims related to the presence of talc in certain products sold by the Company and/or claims raised by the Hair Relaxer Claimants. While the Company believes that such claims do not have merit, such claims could cause reputational damage for the Company. Such claims could also result in liability that could adversely affect the business and financial results of Reorganized Holdings. It is not possible to predict with certainty the potential claims that Reorganized Holdings may face, nor the final resolution of such claims. The impact of any such claim on the business and financial stability of Reorganized Holdings could be adverse and material. 
 
 Upon emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Reorganized Holdings will be subject to risks related to its substantial indebtedness. 
 
 On the effective date, on a consolidated basis, it is expected that Reorganized Holdings will have total secured, outstanding indebtedness of approximately 1.8 billion, which is expected to consist of the Exit Facilities, as described above. This level of expected indebtedness and the funds required to service such debt could, among other things, make it difficult for Reorganized Holdings to satisfy its obligations under such indebtedness, increasing the risk that it may default on such debt obligations. 
 
 Reorganized Holdings earnings and cash flow may vary significantly from year to year. Additionally, Reorganized Holdings future cash flow may be insufficient to meet its debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact Reorganized Holdings business. A range of economic, competitive, business, and industry factors will affect Reorganized Holdings future financial performance and, as a result, its ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay its debt. Many of these factors are beyond its control. 
 
 If Reorganized Holdings does not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: 
 
 a. refinancing or restructuring debt; 
 b. selling assets; 
 c. reducing or delaying capital investments; or 
 d. seeking to raise additional capital. 
 
 It cannot be assured, however, that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would be possible on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and allow Reorganized Holdings to meet its debt obligations. An inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect the Reorganized Holdings ability to make payments on the Exit Facilities, as well as Reorganized Holdings business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The Exit Facilities Documents will contain restrictions, limitations, and specific covenants that could significantly affect Reorganized Holdings ability to operate its business, as well as adversely affect its liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect its results of operations. These covenants are expected to restrict its ability (subject to certain exceptions) to: (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt; (iv) make loans and investments; (v) sell assets; (vi) incur liens; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) alter the businesses it conducts; (ix) enter into agreements restricting any restricted subsidiary s ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all of its assets. 
 
 As a result of these restrictive covenants in the Exit Facilities Documents, Reorganized Holdings may be: 
 
 a. limited in how it conducts its business; 
 b. unable to raise additional debt or equity financing; 
 c. unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities; or 
 d. limited or unable to make certain changes in its business and to respond to changing circumstances; 
 
 any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Borrowings under the Exit Facilities Documents are at variable rates of interest and will expose Reorganized Holdings to interest rate risk, which could cause Reorganized Holdings debt service obligations to increase significantly. If interest rates increase, Reorganized Holdings debt service obligations on variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and its net income and cash flow available for capital expenditures and debt repayment would decrease. As a result, a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Reorganized Holdings financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to the Company s Industry, Business and Operations 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significantly decreased net sales for the Company particularly during 2020 and has had, and could continue to have, a significant adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows . 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to periodically have, an adverse effect on the Company s business around the globe, which could continue for the foreseeable future. These adverse conditions contributed to a significant decline in net sales within each of the Company s reporting segments and regions worldwide, particularly in 2020. However, with the roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in 2021 and the gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, the Company saw a gradual rebound in consumer spending and consumption in 2021. With the accelerated loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022, the Company saw a robust rebound in consumer spending and consumption in 2022. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused the Company and various of its key third party suppliers to from time to time temporarily close or restrict operations at one or more of their manufacturing facilities which has resulted in a shortage of raw materials, components and finished products. These shortages have in turn caused the Company to be unable to ship products to retailers and consumers from time to time, which has adversely impacted the Company s net sales. Also, if one or more of the Company s key customers were required to close for an extended period, the Company might not be able to ship products to them and consumers may decrease their level of purchasing activity, which would adversely impact the Company s net sales. In addition, U.S. and/or foreign governmental authorities may from time to time recommend or impose other measures, such as China's former Zero Covid Policy, that could cause significant disruptions to the Company s business operations in the regions most impacted by the coronavirus. The continuation of any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic would significantly adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The Company continues to closely monitor the associated impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of any new variants of COVID-19 and subsequent waves of the pandemic, and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic s negative effects on the Company s operations and financial results. 
 
 The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products. Disruptions or delays at this facility and/or at other Company or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales, and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing such shortages. 
 
 The Company produces a substantial portion of its products at its Oxford, North Carolina facility. Significant unscheduled downtime or a reduction in capacity at this facility, or at other Company facilities and/or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured, whether due to the impact of the Company's Chapter 11 Cases and related vendor

 negotiations or to equipment breakdowns, power failures, natural disasters (due to climate change or otherwise), pandemics (including COVID-19), weather conditions hampering delivery schedules, shortages of raw materials and products, technology disruptions or other disruptions, including those caused by transitioning manufacturing across these facilities, or any other cause could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to provide products to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, prospects, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For example, as of December 31, 2022, the Oxford, North Carolina facility was operating at 44 of its production utilization. Additionally, if product sales exceed the Company's forecasts, internal or third-party production capacities and/or the Company's ability to procure sufficient levels of finished goods, raw materials and/or components from third-party suppliers, the Company could, from time-to-time, not have an adequate supply of products to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Volatility in costs, along with delays and disruptions in the supply of materials and services, as a result of the recent global supply chain disruptions, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company purchases raw materials, including essential oils, alcohols, chemicals, containers and packaging components, from various third-party suppliers. Substantial cost increases delays and the unavailability of raw materials or other commodities, as a result of ongoing vendor negotiations during the Chapter 11 Cases and continued global supply chain disruptions, and higher costs for energy, transportation and other necessary services have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the Company s profit margins if it is unable to wholly or partially offset them, such as by achieving cost efficiencies in its supply chain, manufacturing and/or distribution activities. In addition, the Company purchases certain finished goods, raw materials, packaging and other components from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and if the Company is required to find alternative sources of supply, these new suppliers may have to be qualified under applicable industry, governmental and Company-mandated vendor standards, which can require additional investment and be time-consuming. Any significant disruption to the Company s manufacturing or sourcing of products or raw materials, packaging and other components for any reason (including the continued global supply chain disruptions) could materially impact the Company s inventory levels and interrupt and delay the Company s supply of products to its retail customers. 
 
 Also, the Company is continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, the Company outsources certain functions that it believes can be performed more efficiently by third parties, such as in the areas of IT, finance, tax and human resources. These third parties could fail to provide the expected level of services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the expected fees. Such events, if not promptly remedied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, reputation, results of operation, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company's financial performance depends on its ability to anticipate and respond to consumer trends and changes in consumer preferences. New product introductions may not be as successful as the Company anticipates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company has a rigorous process for the continuous development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, product development, operations, law and finance. However, consumer preference and spending patterns change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that the Company will anticipate and respond to trends for beauty products effectively. Each new product launch, including those resulting from the Company's recently updated product development process, carries risks, as well as the possibility of unexpected consequences, including: 
 
 the acceptance of the Company's new product launches by, and sales of such new products to, the Company's customers may not be as high as the Company anticipates; 
 the Company's marketing, promotional, advertising and/or pricing strategies for its new products may be less effective than planned and may fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base or engender the desired consumption of the Company's products by consumers; 
 the rate of purchases by the Company's consumers may not be as high as the Company anticipates; 
 the Company's wall displays to showcase its new products may fail to achieve their intended effects; 
 the Company may experience out-of-stocks and/or product returns exceeding its expectations as a result of the Company's new product launches or space reconfigurations or as a result of reductions in retail display space by the Company's customers; 
 30

 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 the Company's net sales may also be impacted by inventory management by its customers or changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by its customers; 
 the Company may incur costs exceeding its expectations as a result of the continued development and launch of new products, including, for example, unanticipated levels of research and development costs, advertising, promotional and/or marketing expenses, sales return expenses or other costs related to launching new products; 
 the Company may experience a decrease in sales of certain of the Company's existing products as a result of newly-launched products, the impact of which could be exacerbated by shelf space limitations and/or any shelf space loss. (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Competition in the beauty industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows."). 
 the Company's product pricing strategies for new product launches may not be accepted by its customers and/or its consumers, which may result in the Company's sales being less than it anticipates; 
 continued global supply chain disruptions and difficulty in procuring raw materials could delay the Company s development or introduction of new products or require the Company to make unexpected changes to its products; 
 the Company may experience a decrease in sales of certain of the Company's products as a result of counterfeit products and/or products sold outside of their intended territories; and/or 
 delays or difficulties impacting the Company's ability, or the ability of the Company's suppliers, to timely manufacture, distribute and ship products or raw materials, as the case may be, displays or display walls in connection with launching new products, such as due to inclement weather conditions or other delays or difficulties (such as those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors - "The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products. Disruptions or delays at this facility and/or at other Company or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales, and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing such shortages."), could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to ship and deliver products to meet its customers reset deadlines. 
 
 Each of the risks referred to above could delay or impede the Company's ability to achieve its sales objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Walmart and its affiliates worldwide accounted for approximately 14 of the Company s worldwide net sales in both 2022 and 2021. The Company expects that, for future periods, Walmart and a small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales. The Company may be affected by changes in the policies and demands of its customers relating to service levels, inventory de-stocking, pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies or limitations on access to wall display space. As is customary in the consumer products industry, none of the Company's customers is under any obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future. 
 
 The loss of Walmart and/or one or more of the Company's other customers that account for a significant portion of the Company's net sales, or any significant decrease in sales to these customers, including as a result of consolidation among such customers, retail store closures in response to the growth in retail sales through e-commerce channels, inventory management by these customers, changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by such customers, space reconfigurations by the Company's customers or any significant decrease in the Company's display space, could reduce the Company's net sales and/or operating income and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

 The Company may be unable to maintain or increase its sales through the Company's primary retailers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 A decrease in consumer demand in the U.S. and/or internationally for beauty products, including as a result of inventory management by the Company's customers, changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers (such as the development and/or continued expansion of private label or their own store-owned brands), a reduction in display space by the Company's customers, store closures in the brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels and/or a change in consumers purchasing habits, such as with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, could result in decreased sales of the Company's products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Competition in the beauty industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The beauty industry is highly competitive. The Company competes primarily by: 
 developing quality products with innovative performance features, shades, finishes, components and packaging; 
 educating consumers, retail customers and salon professionals about the benefits of the Company s products both on-line and in brick and mortar retail outlets; 
 anticipating and responding to changing consumer, retail customer and salon professional demands in a timely manner, including as to the timing of new product introductions and line extensions; 
 offering attractively priced products relative to the product benefits provided; 
 maintaining favorable brand recognition; 
 generating competitive margins and inventory turns for the Company s customers by providing relevant products and executing effective pricing, incentive and promotional programs and marketing and advertising campaigns, as well as social media and influencer marketing activities; 
 ensuring product availability through effective planning and replenishment collaboration with the Company's customers; 
 providing strong and effective advertising, promotion, marketing, social media, influencer and merchandising support; 
 leveraging e-commerce, social media and mobile commerce initiatives and developing an effective omni-channel strategy to optimize the opportunity for consumers to interact with and purchase the Company's products both on-line and in brick and mortar retail outlets; 
 maintaining an effective sales force and distribution network; and 
 obtaining and retaining sufficient display space, optimal in-store positioning and effective presentation of the Company s products on-shelf. 
 
 An increase in or change in the current level of competition that the Company faces could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 In addition to competing with expanding private label and store-owned brands, the Company competes against a number of multi-national manufacturers, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company, and which may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively than the Company on new business acquisitions, research and development activities, technological advances to evolve in their e-commerce capabilities and advertising, promotional, social media influencer and/or marketing activities and have more flexibility than the Company to respond to changing business and economic conditions. 
 
 Additionally, the Company's major customers periodically assess the allocation of display space among competitors and in the course of doing so could elect to reduce the display space allocated to the Company's products, if, for example, the Company's marketing, promotional, advertising and/or pricing strategies for its new and/or existing products are less effective than planned, fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base, fail to engender the desired consumption of the Company's products by consumers and/or fail to sustain productive levels of consumption dollar share and/or the rate of purchases by the Company's consumers are not as high as the Company anticipates. Among the factors used by the Company s major customers in assessing the allocation of display space is a brand s share of the color cosmetics category. The Company's color cosmetics 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 brands have experienced, over time, year-over-year declines in their share of the color cosmetics category in the U.S. and it is possible that the Company may continue to experience further share declines. Further declines in the Company's share for one or more of its principal brands could, among other things, contribute to the additional loss of display space and/or decreased revenues. Any significant loss of display space could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company's Fragrances segment depends on various brand licenses and distribution arrangements for a significant portion of its sales, and the loss of one or more of these licenses or distribution arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company s rights to market and sell certain of its prestige fragrance brands are derived from licenses and other distribution arrangements from unaffiliated third parties and such business is dependent upon the continuation and renewal of such licenses and distribution arrangements on terms favorable to the Company. Each license is for a specific term and may have optional renewal terms. In addition, such licenses and distribution arrangements may be subject to the Company satisfying required minimum royalty payments, minimum advertising and promotional expenditures and satisfying minimum sales requirements. In addition, under certain circumstances, lower net sales may shorten the duration of the applicable license agreement. The loss of one or more of these licenses or other significant distribution arrangements, renewal of one or more of these arrangements on less than favorable terms, the failure to renew one or more of these arrangements and/or difficulties in finding replacement brand licenses for terminated or expired licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The success of the Company's Fragrances segment depends, in part, on the demand for heritage and designer fragrance products. A decrease in demand for such products, or the loss or infringement of any intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company's Fragrances segment has license agreements to manufacture, market and distribute a number of heritage and designer fragrance products, including those of (i) Juicy Couture , John Varvatos and AllSaints in prestige fragrances; (ii) Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , Elizabeth Taylor , and Jennifer Aniston in celebrity fragrances; and (iii) Ed Hardy , Lucky Brand and Geoffrey Beene in mass fragrances. In 2022, the Company's Fragrances segment derived approximately 75 of its net sales from heritage and designer fragrance brands. The demand for these products is affected by general economic conditions, and, to some extent, dependent on the appeal to consumers of the particular designer or talent and the designer s or talent s reputation. The Company also cannot assure that the owners of the trademarks that it licenses can or will successfully maintain their intellectual property rights. If other parties infringe on the intellectual property rights that the Company licenses, the value of such brands in the marketplace may be diluted. To the extent that the heritage or designer fragrance category or a particular designer or talent ceases to be appealing to consumers or a designer s or talent s reputation is adversely affected, sales of the related products and the value of the impacted brands could decrease materially, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company's inability to acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and arrangements could have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The success of the Fragrances segment depends in part upon the continued growth of its portfolio of owned, licensed and distributed brands, including expanding its geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging regions. Efforts to increase sales of the Company's prestige fragrance portfolio and expand its geographic market presence depend upon a number of factors, including its ability to: 
 develop its fragrance brand portfolio through branding, innovation and execution; 
 identify and develop new and existing fragrance brands with the potential to become successful global brands; 
 innovate and develop new fragrance products that are appealing to consumers; 
 acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and the Company's ability to obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements; 
 expand the Company's geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging regions; 
 continue to expand the Company's distribution channels within existing geographies to increase trade presence, brand recognition and sales; 
 expand the Company's trade presence through alternative distribution channels, such as through e-commerce channels; 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 
 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 expand margins through sales growth, the development of higher margin products and overhead and supply chain integration and efficiency initiatives; 
 effectively manage capital investments and working capital to improve the generation of cash flow; and 
 execute any acquisitions quickly and efficiently and integrate new businesses successfully. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully achieve any or all of the above objectives in the manner or time period that it expects. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments, which may result in material short-term costs without generating any current net sales and the Company may not ultimately achieve its net sales objectives associated with such efforts. The future expansion of the Fragrances segment through acquisitions, new fragrance licenses, e-commerce initiatives or other new fragrance distribution arrangements, if any, will depend upon the ability to identify suitable brands to acquire, license or distribute and to obtain the required financing for these acquisitions, licenses or distribution arrangements or to launch or support the brands associated with these agreements or arrangements. The Company may not be able to identify, negotiate, finance or consummate such acquisitions, licenses or arrangements on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. In addition, the Company may decide to divest or discontinue certain brands or streamline operations and may incur costs and charges in doing so. The inability to acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements for the Fragrances segment (such as optimizing its e-commerce sales opportunities) and obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements could have an adverse effect on the Company s net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of the Company s products or the unauthorized diversion by third parties of the Company s products could have an adverse effect on the Company s net sales and a negative impact on the Company s reputation and business. 
 
 Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of the Company s products. These counterfeit products may be inferior in terms of quality and other characteristics compared to the Company s authentic products and/or the counterfeit products could pose safety risks that the Company s authentic products would not otherwise present to consumers. Consumers could confuse counterfeit products with the Company s authentic products, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company s brands and cause consumers to refrain from purchasing the Company s products in the future, which could adversely affect the Company s net sales and have a negative impact on the Company s reputation. 
 
 The Company sells a substantial portion of its professional products to professional salon distributors and/or wholesalers. Products sold to these customers are meant to be used exclusively by salons and individual salon professionals or are sold exclusively to the retail consumers of these salons. Despite the Company s efforts to prevent diversion of such products from these customers, incidents have occurred and continue to occur whereby the Company s products are sold to sales outlets other than the intended salons and salon professionals, such as to general merchandise retailers or unapproved outlets. In some instances, these diverted products may be old, damaged or otherwise adulterated, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company s brands. In addition, such diversion may result in lower net sales of the Company s products if consumers choose to purchase diverted products and/or choose to purchase products manufactured or sold by the Company s competitors because of any perceived damage or diminishment to the image, reputation and/or value of the Company s brands. 
 
 The Company believes that its trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to the Company s success and its competitive position. The Company devotes significant resources to registering and protecting its intellectual property rights and maintaining the positive image of its brands. The Company s trademark and patent applications may fail to result in issued registrations or provide the scope of coverage sought. Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with enforcing and/or defending the Company s trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property rights could result in higher than expected operating expenses. The Company has been unable to eliminate, and may in the future be unable to eliminate, all counterfeiting activities, unauthorized product diversion and infringement of its trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property, any of which could adversely affect the Company s net sales and have a negative impact on the Company s reputation.

 The Company's success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of its products. 
 
 The Company's success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of its products. If the Company's products are found or alleged to be defective or unsafe, or if they fail to meet customer or consumer standards, the Company's relationships with its customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of the Company's brands could be diminished and the Company could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For example, the Company is named in lawsuits alleging product liability issues, all of which the Company believes are without merit and defends against vigorously, however, the outcome and impact of these lawsuits, which include cases based on the presence of talc in certain products and cases involving chemical hair straightening and hair relaxing products sold by the Company, cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 
 The Company s success largely depends upon its ability to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce, as well as effectively implement succession planning for its senior management team, and, as such, the Company s inability to do so could adversely affect the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Continuing to execute the Company's business initiatives largely depends on the Company s ability to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce, as well as effectively implement succession planning for its senior management team. The Company has recently experienced increased employee attrition and labor shortages primarily due to COVID-19 and the Company's Chapter 11 Cases. The Company's failure to adequately address increased employee turnover or to maintain an adequate succession plan to effectively transition current management leadership positions and/or the Company s failure to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce could adversely affect the Company s institutional knowledge base and/or competitive advantage. If the Company is unable to attract, hire and/or retain talented and highly qualified senior management, other key employees and/or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, or if the Company is unable to effectively provide for the succession of its senior management team, the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 The Company previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, which was remediated during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting primarily related to control deficiencies within various aspects of its control environment. As a result of these control deficiencies, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019, the Company completed a series of actions and measures that effectively remediated the previously-disclosed material weakness and concluded that as of December 31, 2019 its internal control over financial reporting was effective. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of the 2019 Form 10-K. The Company cannot provide assurances that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that it will be able to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Furthermore, if the remediated material weakness recurs in the future or a new material weakness occurs, it could negatively impact the Company s ability to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. If the Company were unable to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, such circumstances would expose the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation s various debt instruments and cause the Company to seek any necessary consents, waivers or amendments from its lenders. Under such circumstances, Products Corporation faces the risk that it may not be able to obtain any such consents, waivers or amendments, that the terms of any such consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of its indebtedness and/or Products Corporation may not be able to refinance its existing indebtedness to enable it to repay that indebtedness when it becomes due. Also, if the Company is unable to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, it could result in damage to the Company s reputation, financial obligations to third parties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation, any or all of which could result in additional business disruptions and the Company incurring potentially substantial costs.

 The Company may not realize the cost reductions and other benefits that it expects from its various restructuring programs that may be in effect from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 From time to time, the Company implements restructuring programs, such as the RGGA (such programs as may be in effect from time to time being referred to as Restructuring Programs that are generally designed to streamline the Company s operations, reporting structures and business processes, with the objective of maximizing productivity and improving profitability, cash flows and liquidity. Events and circumstances may occur that are beyond the Company s control, such as delays caused by third parties and unexpected costs, could result in the Company not realizing all of the anticipated cost reductions and benefits or the Company not realizing the cost reductions or other benefits on its expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, commodity costs and/or in tax, labor or other laws may result in the Company not achieving the anticipated cost reductions and benefits, as measured in U.S. dollars. If the Company is unable to realize the Restructuring Programs cost reduction objectives and other benefits, the Company s ability to fund other initiatives and enhance its profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, some of the actions that the Company is taking in furtherance of the Restructuring Programs may become a distraction for the Company s managers and employees and may disrupt the Company s ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or attract qualified employees; disrupt or weaken the Company s internal control structures; and/or give rise to negative publicity which could affect the Company s business reputation. If the Company is unable to successfully implement the Restructuring Programs, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Company s expectations, it could adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For additional information regarding the 2018 Optimization Program and the 2020 Restructuring Program, refer to Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Restructuring charges and other, net. For additional information regarding the RGGA, see Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Revlon Global Growth Accelerator Program. 
 
 General Business and Regulatory Risks 
 
 The Company's foreign operations are subject to a variety of social, political and economic risks and have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations, foreign currency controls, government-mandated pricing controls, duties, tariffs and/or other trade measures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows and the value of its foreign assets. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had operations based in 25 foreign countries and its products were sold in approximately 150 countries. The Company is exposed to risks associated with social, political and economic conditions, inherent in operating in foreign countries, including those in Asia (such as China's previously enacted Zero Covid Policy, Australia, Canada, Eastern Europe), Mexico, South Africa and South America (such as Argentina), which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Such risks include inflation, foreign currency devaluation, tariffs, foreign currency controls, government-mandated pricing controls, currency remittance restrictions, changes in tax laws, changes in consumer purchasing habits (including as to retailer preferences) and changes in regulations enacted to address the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change, as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade, investment and climate change. 
 
 The U.S. and the other countries in which the Company s products are manufactured or sold have imposed and may impose additional duties, tariffs and other retaliatory or trade protection measures, or other restrictions or regulations, including regulations enacted to address the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels, which can affect the cost and availability of materials that the Company uses to manufacture and package its products and the sale of finished products. For example, the E.U. has imposed tariffs on certain beauty products imported from the U.S., which would impact the sale in the E.U. of certain of the Company s more prestige products that are manufactured in the U.S. Similarly, the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods and materials from China would impact any materials that the Company imports from that region for use in manufacturing or packaging in the U.S. Measures that the Company could be required to take to reduce the impact of tariff increases or trade restrictions, including shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, geographical diversification of the Company s sources of supply, adjustments in product or packaging design and fabrication, or increased prices, could increase the Company s costs and delay the Company s time to bring its products to shelf. Other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements have the potential to adversely impact demand for the Company s products, production costs, retail customers and suppliers. These risks, which could increase the Company s costs and reduce the Company s net sales and profitability, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 36

 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 These risks and limitations could also affect the ability of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to obtain sufficient capital to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business. Limitations and the difficulties that certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries may experience on the free flow of funds to and from these foreign subsidiaries could restrict the Company's ability to respond timely to challenging business conditions or changes in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company's net sales outside of the U.S. for each of 2022 and 2021 represented approximately 54 and 53 of the Company's total consolidated net sales, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected the Company's results of operations and the value of the Company's foreign net assets in 2022 and they may adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the value of the Company's foreign net assets in future periods, which in turn could cause a material adverse effect on the Company's reported net sales and earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. 
 
 Products Corporation may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts may, from time to time, be entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in foreign currencies and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2022, the notional amount of Products Corporation's foreign currency forward exchange contracts was nil. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts may not adequately protect the Company against the negative effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect the Company's overall liquidity. 
 
 Adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows and/or on the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. 
 
 Consumer spending on beauty products is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Adverse economic conditions, such as a recession, in the United States or any of the other countries in which we do significant business, or protracted periods of high inflation or high energy prices may contribute to higher unemployment levels, decreased consumer spending, reduced credit availability and declining consumer confidence and demand, any of which poses a risk to our business. Any sustained economic downturn in the United States or any of the other countries in which we conduct significant business, may cause significant readjustments in both the volume and mix of our product sales, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and other financial markets and economic conditions could, among other things, impair the financial condition of one or more of the Company's customers or suppliers, thereby increasing the risk of customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. If we are unable to successfully navigate adverse economic conditions, including offsetting the impact of high inflation and high energy prices on our business, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused, and is currently expected to continue to cause, negative effects on geopolitical conditions and the global economy, including financial markets, inflation, and the global supply chain, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In February 2022, Russian military forces launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine that has resulted in an ongoing military conflict between the two countries. The length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, and the conflict has caused, and is currently expected to continue to cause, global political, economic, and social instability, disruptions to the global economy, financial systems, international trade, the global supply chain and the transportation and energy sectors, among others. 
 
 Russia s recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and subsequent military action against Ukraine have led to an unprecedented expansion of sanction programs imposed by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People s Republic. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia, Belarus and other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as the existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine and are assessing its impact on our business, including our business partners and customers. We have suspended our operations with our indirect subsidiary, Beautyge Russia. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine or its impacts in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the above-mentioned factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The United Kingdom s ongoing withdrawal process from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company is a multinational company with worldwide operations, including material business operations in Europe. On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") formally withdrew from the European Union and on January 1, 2021, the U.K. left the EU Single Market and Customs Union. 
 
 The U.K. has ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. 
 
 The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union and developments related to such withdrawal, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets, affect trade between the U.K. and the European Union, or restrict our access to capital. For example, potential new restricted economic terms or additional bureaucratic requirements in free trade between the U.K. and the European Union, such as new customs or regulatory checks, including rules of origin and stringent local content requirements, could negatively impact fulfillment times, increase our costs, result in a decrease in sales, or cause us to lose customers in the European Union and the U.K. Similar adverse consequences could occur if regions such as Catalonia, where the Co mpany's Spain businesses are headquartered, eventually succeed in withdrawing from their parent country. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 4 of the Company's net sales were in the U.K. and approximately 12 of the Company's net sales were in the European Union. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Terrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which the Company operates and the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 On September 11, 2001, the U.S. was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope. These attacks contributed to major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence. These terrorist attacks, as well as subsequent terrorist attacks (such as those that have occurred in Berlin, Germany; Nice, France; Orlando, Florida; Istanbul, Turkey; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Benghazi, Libya; Madrid, Spain; London, England and the attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and the U.S.'s military response to such attack), attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other military actions and/or civil unrest, such as that occurring in France, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and surrounding areas may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer spending and/or reduced demand for the Company's products. These developments subject the Company's worldwide operations to increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce the Company's net sales and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Declines in the financial markets may result in increased pension expense and increased cash contributions to the Company's pension plans. 
 
 Declines in the U.S. and global financial markets, could result in significant declines in the Company's pension plan assets and result in increased pension expense and cash contributions to the Company's pension plans. Interest rate levels will affect the discount rate used to value the Company's year-end pension benefit obligations. One or more of these factors, individually

 or taken together, could impact future required cash contributions to the Company's pension plans and pension expense. Any one or more of these conditions could reduce the Company's available liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters due to climate change or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Extreme weather conditions due to climate change or otherwise that impact the retail store locations of the Company s customers, or the locations of the Company s manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, overseas offices, third-party suppliers and/or other vendors could disrupt the supply and shipment of the Company s products to consumers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Moreover, natural disasters due to climate change or otherwise, such as tornadoes, fires, hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could result in economic instability and/or disruptions to the Company s operations and/or the operations of the Company s retail customers, distributors, third-party-suppliers and other vendors, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company's products are subject to federal, state and international regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company s business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and trade policies. The Company is subject to regulation by the FTC and the FDA in the U.S., as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities, including those in the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates. The Company's Oxford, North Carolina manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA as a drug manufacturing establishment, permitting the manufacture of cosmetics and other beauty-care products that contain over-the-counter drug ingredients, such as sunscreens, anti-perspirant deodorants and anti-dandruff hair-care products. Regulations in the U.S., the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates that are designed to protect consumers or the environment, such as regulations enacted to address the impacts of climate change, have an increasing influence on the Company's product claims, ingredients and packaging. To the extent federal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory changes occur in the future, whether due to changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and enforcement policies by regulatory authorities, they could require the Company to reformulate or discontinue certain of its products or revise its product packaging or labeling, any of which could result in, among other things, increased costs to the Company, delays in product launches, product returns or recalls and lower net sales, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Any violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar foreign anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 A significant portion of the Company s revenue is derived from operations outside the U.S. and the Company has significant facilities outside the U.S., which exposes the Company to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in conducting international business transactions. The Company is subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other similar foreign anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and other types of improper payments. While the Company s employees and agents are required to comply with these laws and the Company has developed policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with such laws, there is no assurance that the Company s policies and procedures will prevent all violations of these laws, despite the Company s long-standing commitment to conducting its business and achieving its objectives by maintaining the highest level of ethical standards and legal compliance. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice, and their foreign counterparts, have continued to increase their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws and any violation of these laws or allegations of such may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions, as well as other substantial costs and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Disruptions to or breaches of the Company's information technology systems, and the potential failure to adequately detect or resolve such interruptions or breaches in a timely manner, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
 39

 business operations, prospects, results of operations and, financial condition which could lead to reputational damage and significant liabilities. 
 
 The operation of the Company's business depends on the Company's information technology systems. The Company relies on its information technology systems to effectively manage, among other things, the Company's business data, communications, supply chain, inventory management, customer order entry and order fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and other processes and data necessary to manage the Company's business. Disruptions to the Company's information technology systems, including any disruptions to the Company's current systems and/or as a result of transitioning to additional or replacement information technology systems, as the case may be, could disrupt the Company's business and could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company's control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems disruptions, system conversions, security breaches, cyberattacks, phishing attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, the Company could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace its information technology systems, and the Company could experience interruptions in its ability to service its customers. These risks have been and may continue to be exacerbated as a result of remote working in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 In addition, as part of the Company's normal business activities, the Company collects and stores certain confidential information, including personal information with respect to customers, consumers and employees, as well as information related to intellectual property, and the success of its e-commerce operations depends on the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The Company may share some of this information with vendors who assist the Company with certain aspects of its business. Moreover, the success of the Company s e-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Any failure on the part of the Company or its vendors to maintain the security of this confidential data and personal information, including via the penetration of the Company s network security (or those if its vendors) and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to the Company s reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation, any or all of which could result in the Company incurring potentially substantial costs. Such events could also result in the deterioration of confidence in the Company by employees, consumers and customers and cause other competitive disadvantages. In addition, a security or data privacy breach could require the Company to expend significant additional resources to enhance its information security systems and could result in a disruption to the Company s operations. Furthermore, third parties, such as the Company s suppliers and retail customers, may also rely on information technology and be subject to such cybersecurity breaches. These breaches may negatively impact their businesses, which could in turn disrupt the Company s supply chain and/or the Company s business operations. Due to the potential significant costs, business disruption and reputational damage that typically accompany a cyberattack or cybersecurity breach, any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company s information technology systems, or those of its third-party service providers, may be accessed by unauthorized users such as cyber criminals as a result of a disruption, cyberattack or other security breach. Cyberattacks and other cybersecurity incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. As techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, a disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of the Company s information technology systems or infrastructure, or those of its third-party service providers, may go undetected for an extended period and could result in the theft, transfer, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of Company, employee, representative, customer, vendor, consumer and/or other third-party data, including sensitive or confidential data, personal information and/or intellectual property. The Company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent or timely detect breaches or breakdowns of the Company s or its third-party service providers information technology systems. The Company also cannot guarantee that it will be able to timely remediate any breaches or breakdowns that it detects. In addition, like most major corporations, the Company's information systems are a target of cyberattacks and although the incidents that the Company has experienced to date have not had a material effect, if the Company suffers a material loss or disclosure of confidential information as a result of a breach of its information technology systems, including those of its third-party service providers, the Company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or

 damages, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Further, the Company is subject to an evolving body of federal, state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy and security. Several governments, including the E.U., have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens, and regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (the UK GDPR and the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR each allows for a private right of action, imposes stringent data protection requirements on companies that offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, as applicable. The UK GDPR and the GDPR establishes a robust framework of data subjects rights and imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 17.5 million British pounds or 20 million euros, respectively, or 4 of annual global revenue. 
 
 In addition, the State of California enacted a data privacy law applicable to entities serving or employing California residents (the CCPA that required compliance by January 2020. The UK GDPR, GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in federal, state and foreign laws, rules or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data and other personal information, require the Company to evaluate its current operations, information technology systems and data handling practices and to implement enhancements and adaptations where necessary to comply with these new laws, rules and regulations, which could greatly increase the Company s operational costs or require the Company to adapt certain operations or activities to comply with the stricter regulatory requirements. The Company's inability to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles or to quickly adapt the Company's practices to reflect them as they develop, could potentially subject the Company to significant fines, damages, liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the income tax provisions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
 
 The Company is subject to taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the United States. 
 
 The Company is also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA that significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of certain expenses and adds certain limitations to the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising after December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2022, the TCJA required all U.S. companies to capitalize, and subsequently amortize research and experimental R E expenses that fall within the scope of Section 174. We have accounted for the effects of the R E capitalization, based on interpretation of the law as currently enacted. In addition, when the taxpayer calculates the adjusted taxable income for purposes of Section 163(j) business interest limitation calculation, depreciation, amortization and depletion expense are no longer added back to calculate the adjusted taxable income for tax years starting January 1, 2022. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax rate applicable for our fiscal 2024 taxable year and a 1 federal excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 (b) Owned: 512,000 Sq. Ft.; Leased: 219,000 Sq. Ft. 
 
 In addition to the facilities described above, the Company owns and leases additional facilities in various areas throughout the world, including the lease of the Company's offices in New York, New York (approximately 107,000 square feet) and the office lease in Cornella, Spain (approximately 89,000 square feet). Effective February 2023, the Company moved into a smaller leased office space in New York, NY (approximately 69,000 square feet). Effective March 2023, the Court approved the rejection of the New York office lease at One New York Plaza, New York, NY 10004. Management considers the Company's facilities to be well-maintained and satisfactory for the Company's operations, and believes that the Company's facilities and third-party contractual supplier arrangements provide sufficient capacity for its current and expected production requirements. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company s income for that particular period.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy 
 
 On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The information contained in Note 1-General- Going Concern of the notes to the consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference. As a result of such Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, substantially all proceedings pending against the Debtors have been stayed. These matters will be subject to resolution in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 
 As part of the Chapter 11 Cases, parties believing that they have claims or causes of action against the Debtors could file proofs of claim evidencing such claims. Pursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, all proofs of claim were to be filed with the Bankruptcy Court by October 24, 2022 (the "Claims Bar Date"), except for claims by Governmental units, which were to be filed with the Bankruptcy Court by December 12, 2022, and Hair Relaxer Claimants, which are to be filed with the Bankruptcy Court by April 11, 2023. The filed claims have been or are being reconciled to amounts recorded in liabilities subject to compromise in our consolidated balance sheet. The Debtors may ask the Bankruptcy Court to disallow claims that the Debtors believe are duplicative, have been later amended or superseded, are without merit, are overstated or should be disallowed for other reasons. In addition, as a result of this process, the Debtors may identify additional liabilities that will need to be recorded or reclassified to liabilities subject to compromise. In light of the substantial number of claims filed, the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete and likely will continue after the Debtors emerge from bankruptcy. 
 
 Adversary Complaints 
 
 August 12, 2022 Adversary Complaint 
 
 On August 12, 2022, Citi filed an Adversary Complaint (the August 12, 2022 Adversary Complaint against Revlon, Inc., Products Corporation, and several of Products Corporation s subsidiaries in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 22-10760-dsj [Docket No. 373]. The August 12, 2022 Adversary Complaint arises out of the District Court s judgment entered on February 16, 2021 in the Citibank Litigation described elsewhere in this 2022 Form 10-K. Because the Second Circuit vacated the District Court s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings In re Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers , No. 21-487 (2d Cir. 2022)), the parties agreed to stay the adversary proceeding pending disposition of the District Court litigation. On February 21, 2023, the District Court so ordered the Joint Stipulation and Order for Voluntary Dismissal of Adversary Proceeding, dismissing the adversary proceeding in its entirety. 
 
 October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint 
 
 On October 31, 2022, a group of lenders under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement filed an Adversary Complaint against Revlon, Inc., Products Corporation, several of Products Corporation s subsidiaries, and several of Products Corporation s contractual counterparties, including Jefferies Finance LLC, Jefferies LLC, and several lenders under the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement and certain financial institutions that are lenders or the affiliates of lenders under Products Corporation s 2016 Term Loan Agreement, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint ), Case No. 22-10760-dsj [Docket No. 956]. 
 
 The October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint alleges various spurious causes of action, stemming from various alleged breaches of the provisions of the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, including claims for breach of contract, declaratory judgment, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, aiding and abetting conversion, unjust enrichment, equitable subordination, tortious interference with contract, and constructive trust. The October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint seeks various forms of relief, including declaratory relief, specific performance, rescission of certain existing agreements, injunctive relief, damages, costs and expenses, attorneys fees, and pre-judgment interest. 
 
 On December 5, 2022, in response to the October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, asking the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the claims against the Company on the bases that: (i) such claims are derivative and the plaintiffs lack standing to pursue them, (ii) such claims are not permissible under New York law or the Bankruptcy Code, (iii) entering into the previously disclosed August 2019 senior secured term loan facility by and among the Company, Products Corporation, certain affiliated funds, investment vehicles or accounts managed or advised by Ares Management LLC, as lender and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative and collateral agent (the "2019 Term Loan Facility" or the "2019 Term Loan Agreement) did not violate the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, and (iv) such claims fail to state viable tort or quasi-contract claims under New York law. Jefferies and the BrandCo Lenders also filed motions to dismiss the October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint. 
 
 On the same day, the Company also filed an Answer and Counterclaims in response to the October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint, in which the Company requested a declaratory judgment that, among other things, the plaintiffs are not entitled to 
 43

 REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

the relief they are seeking in connection with the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement, or any other equitable relief under New York Law and the Bankruptcy Code. 
 
 A hearing on the Company s motion to dismiss was held on February 2, 2023, and on February 14, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court granted the motion to dismiss as to all claims against the Company and all of the October 31, 2022 Adversary Complaint claims for equitable relief. With respect to the non-Company defendants, the Bankruptcy Court directed all parties to file letters on or before February 15, 2023 concerning whether the standing grounds on which the Bankruptcy Court s decision was based apply to the remaining causes of action as against the non-Company defendants, and the parties filed such letters on the Bankruptcy Court s docket on February 15, 2023. A trial was scheduled to begin on March 6, 2023. 
 
 Due to the global settlement embodied in the Plan, the parties have agreed that the adversary proceeding will be stayed pending confirmation of the Plan, at which point the Debtors anticipate that the adversary proceeding will be dismissed with prejudice through the Bankruptcy Court s order confirming the Plan and/or a separate order entered on the adversary proceeding s docket. The parties agreement is also reflected in the So Ordered Stipulation and Order Signed on 2/27/2023 Staying the Adversary Proceeding and Dismissing the Complaint Upon the Plan Effective Date , Case No. 22-01167-dsj [Docket No. 130].

 NYSE Delisting and Transfer to the Over-the-Counter ("OTC") Market 
 
 Revlon s only class of capital stock outstanding at December 31, 2022 was its Class A Common Stock, with a par value of 0.01 per share. At December 31, 2022, MacAndrews Forbes, which is beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman, beneficially owned 46,223,321 shares of Class A Common Stock. As a result, at December 31, 2022, Mr. Perelman, indirectly through MacAndrews Forbes, beneficially owned approximately 85.1 of the issued and outstanding shares of Revlon's Class A Common Stock, which represented approximately 85.1 of the voting power of Revlon s capital stock. The remaining 8,078,680 shares of Class A Common Stock that were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 were owned by the public. Under the terms of the Plan and Restructuring Support Agreement and subject to approval of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court, the Company is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a privately held company and its outstanding equity is expected to be cancelled. 
 
 On June 16, 2022, the Company received a letter from the staff of NYSE Regulation that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist the Class A Common Stock of the Company from the NYSE in light of the Company s disclosure on June 15, 2022 that it and certain of its subsidiaries had commenced voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11. The Company appealed the NYSE s delisting decision in a timely manner and the NYSE completed its review on October 13, 2022. On October 20, 2022, the NYSE informed the Company, and publicly announced its determination following such appeal, that the Company s Class A Common Stock was no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE and the NYSE suspended trading in the Company s Class A Common Stock after the market close on October 20, 2022. On October 21, 2022, the NYSE applied to the SEC pursuant to Form 25 to remove the Class A Common Stock of the Company from listing and registration on the NYSE at the opening of business on November 1, 2022. As a result of the suspension and delisting, the Company's Class A Common Stock began trading exclusively on the OTC market on October 21, 2022 under the symbol REVRQ. Over-the counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

 Item 7. Combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements of this 2022 Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled Forward-Looking Statements, this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 
 
 On June 15, 2022, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have operated their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

Termination by one of these creditor groups will result in the termination of the Restructuring Support Agreement as to the terminating group only, with the Restructuring Support Agreement remaining in effect with respect to the Debtors and the non-terminating group. 
 
 Under the terms of the Plan and Restructuring Support Agreement and subject to approval of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court, the Company is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a privately held company and its outstanding equity is expected to be cancelled.

Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we conducted an evaluation as to whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Each reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a liquidity position of 308.3 million, consisting of: (i) 249.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately 94.6 million held outside the U.S.) ; (ii) 60.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the DIP ABL Facility (which had 41.8 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately 1.4 million of outstanding checks. The Company's evaluation includes its ability to meet its future contractual obligations and other conditions and events that may impact its liquidity. 
 
 In light of the Company's Chapter 11 Cases, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, its ability to, subject to the Bankruptcy Court's approval as applicable, (i) implement the Plan in a timely manner and within the milestones that have been established under the DIP Facilities and the Restructuring Support Agreement, which currently contemplate obtaining confirmation of the Plan and emerging from Chapter 11 in April 2023, and (ii) generate sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases and following emergence from Chapter 11 to meet our contractual obligations and operating needs. As a result of risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, (i) the Company's ability to obtain requisite support for the Plan from various stakeholders, and (ii) the disruptive effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and liquidity making it potentially more difficult to maintain business, financing and operational relationships, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 
 The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated substantially all of the Company's obligations under nearly all of its pre-petition debt instruments. As such, the Company reclassified all pre-petition debt obligations to liabilities subject to compromise on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. For additional discussion regarding the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's debt obligations, see Note 8. Debt. 
 
 The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company continues to focus on cost reduction and risk mitigation actions to address potential macroeconomic headwinds, such as rising global inflation and a potential economic recession or contraction in the near future. The Company may generate additional liquidity through continued cost control initiatives as well as funds provided by selling certain assets or other strategic transactions, potentially subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. If sales decline, the Company s cost control initiatives may include reductions in discretionary spend and reductions in investments in capital and permanent displays.

 The Company operates in four brand-centric reporting segments that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics; fragrances; skin care; hair color, hair care and hair treatments; beauty tools; men's grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products. 
 Business Strate gy 
 
 The Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic brands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its consumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers shop, both in-store and increasingly online. The Company has continued to deliver against the objectives of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (subsequently renamed during 2021 the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator, RGGA , as herein after defined), which includes rightsizing our organization with the objectives of driving improved profitability, cash flow and liquidity. The Company is also managing the business to conserve cash and liquidity, as well as continuing to focus on stabilizing the business, growing e-commerce and preparing the foundation for achieving future growth. 
 
 COVID-19 Impact on the Company s Business 
 
 While the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the COVID-19 pandemic has periodically adversely impacted net sales in all major commercial regions around the globe that are important to the Company's business, particularly during 2020. However, with the roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in 2021 and the gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, the Company saw a gradual rebound in consumer spending and consumption in 2021. With the accelerated loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022, the Company saw a more robust rebound in consumer spending. Despite robust customer demand in 2022, the Company experienced challenges meeting customer demand due to global supply chain disruptions and the difficulty of obtaining raw materials necessary for the manufacturing of its products. COVID-19 outbreaks around the world from time to time have led to global supply chain disruptions, including manufacturing, shipment and transportation delays (due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, such as China's Zero Covid Policy), closures, employee absences, port congestion, labor and container shortages, increased transportation costs, tight labor markets and inflationary pressures; and import and export restrictions. As the Company currently expects that the COVID-19 pandemic may periodically continue to impact its business going forward, the Company will continue to closely monitor the associated impacts and take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic s negative effects on the Company s operations and financial results.

 Overview of Net Sales and Earnings Results 
 
 Consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,980.4 million, a 98.3 million decrease, or 4.7 , compared to 2,078.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the 85.8 million unfavorable FX impact, consolidated net sales decreased by 12.5 million, or 0.6 , during the year ended December 31, 2022. The XFX net sales decrease of 12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to: a 45.0 million, or 11.3 , decrease in Fragrances segment net sales and 30.8 million or 7.3 , decrease in Portfolio segment net sales, partially offset by a 57.8 million, or 7.9 , increase in Revlon segment net sales and 5.5 million, or 1.0 , increase in Elizabeth Arden segment net sales. 
 Consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2022 was 673.9 million, compared to consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, of 206.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The 467.0 million increase in consolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to: 
 416.0 million increase in reorganization items, net related to the Company's voluntary Chapter 11 filing on June 15, 2022. The costs are primarily related to legal and professional fees, the write-off of original issue discount and deferred long-term debt fees on debt subject to compromise, adjustments to estimated allowed claim amounts, financing cost incurred relating to the DIP Term Loan Facility and the bankruptcy related employee compensation programs during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to nil during the December 31, 2021;

 84.9 million of lower gross profit, primarily due to lower net sales and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by favorable inventory pricing adjustments during year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021; 
 a 5.2 million increase in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by interest expense from DIP facilities partially offset by contractual interest stayed on certain pre-petition debt reclassified to LSTC; 
 a 24.3 million increase in non-cash impairment charges for finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangibles of 18.7 million and 5.6 million, respectively, recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021. The impairment indicators comprised primarily of a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions, such as the global supply chain disruptions and inflation, potential increases to costs of raw materials and adverse developments in equity and credit markets; 
 14.5 million of unfavorable variance in foreign currency, resulting from 25.1 million in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 10.6 million in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany payables, particularly, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Australian Dollar; 
 a 25.5 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings, net change of valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets for certain jurisdictions; 
 a 1.2 million net increase in other miscellaneous expenses, net, in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to fees in connection with prepetition refinancing transactions; and 
 1.1 million of lower gain on divested assets primarily related to the sale of certain assets in the year ended December 31, 2021 , consisting of the Company's Gatineau brand; 
 with the foregoing partially offset by: 
 66.0 million of lower SG A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by lower brand support expenses, favorable foreign currency impacts and lower permanent displays costs, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses; 
 a 19.6 million decrease in restructuring charges, primarily related to lower expenditures under RGGA in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021; 
 a 18.7 million decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the write off of debt issuance costs on debt subject to compromise to reorganization items, net subsequent to the Chapter 11 filing, in accordance with ASC 852 ; and 
 a 1.4 million decrease in acquisition, integration and divestiture costs in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by higher amortization of the cash-based awards under the Revlon 2019 TIP in the prior year period (see Note 12, "Stock Compensation Plan," to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional details on the 2019 TIP).

 Segment Results: 
 
 The Company's management evaluates segment profit for each of the Company's reportable segments. The Company allocates corporate expenses to each reportable segment to arrive at segment profit, as these expenses are included in the internal measure of segment operating performance. The Company defines segment profit as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses and reorganization items, net. Segment profit also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 16, "Segment Data and Related Information," to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

This decrease was driven primarily by the Portfolio segment's lower net sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by lower brand support and other SG A expenses. 
 
 Fragrances Segment 
 Fragrances segment net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022 were 344.7 million, a 54.7 million, or 13.7 , decrease, compared to 399.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

This decrease was partially offset by higher net sales of licensed fragrances in the International regions. 
 
 Fragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2022 was 59.2 million, a 13.1 million, or 18.1 , decrease, compared to 72.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the 1.7 million unfavorable FX impact, Fragrances segment profit in the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 11.4 million, or 15.8 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change SG A expenses 1,033.1 1,099.1 (66.0) 
 
 SG A expenses decreased by 66.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, driven primarily by: 
 lower brand support expenses of approximately 41.3 million, as investment was prioritized to key brands; 
 favorable FX impact of approximately 37.2 million; and 
 lower product display costs of approximately 9.7 million 
 with the foregoing partially offset by:

 0.9 2.3 (1.4) 
 
 Acquisition, integration and divestiture costs decreased 1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the higher amortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 TIP (the "2019 TIP") in the prior year period.

The extension and expansion will provide an additional year to implement larger projects and help make up for supply chain headwinds and the extended COVID restrictions throughout the globe. 
 
 The major initiatives underlying the RGGA Program will remain and include: 
 Strategic Growth: Boost organic sales growth behind our strategic pillars brands, markets, and channels -- to deliver mid-single digit Compound Average Annual Growth Rate through 2024. 
 Operating Efficiencies : Drive additional operational efficiencies and cost savings for margin improvement and to fuel investments in growth.

 The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision for income taxes of 6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 25.5 million increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to same period in 2021, was primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings, net change of valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets for certain jurisdictions. 
 
 The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to losses and certain deductions for which no tax benefit can be recognized. Effective in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA requires all U.S. companies to capitalize, and subsequently amortize research and experimental R E expenses that fall within the scope of Section 174. We have accounted for the effects of the R E capitalization, based on interpretation of the law as currently enacted. In addition, when the taxpayer calculates the adjusted taxable income for purposes of Section 163(j) business interest limitation calculation, depreciation, amortization and depletion expense are no longer added back to calculate the adjusted taxable income for tax years starting January 1, 2022. 
 
 The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the "ARPA") which expands the Employee Retention Credit and the roster of covered employees under 162(m) deduction limits. The ARPA did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company concluded that, based on its evaluation of objectively verifiable evidence, it continues to be more likely than not that its net federal deferred tax assets are not recoverable. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the key assumptions used to determine positive and negative evidence included the Company s cumulative taxable income or loss for the past three years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, the implementation of tax planning strategies, as well as the Company's cost reduction initiatives and efficiency efforts. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of 110.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 25.2 million in 2021) as a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.

 Refer to Revlon s Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had a liquidity position of 308.3 million, consisting of: (i) 249.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately 94.6 million held outside the U.S.) ; (ii) 60.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the DIP ABL Facility (which had 41.8 million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately 1.4 million of outstanding checks. 
 Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we conducted an evaluation as to whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Each reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. 
 In light of the Company's Chapter 11 Cases, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, its ability to, subject to the Bankruptcy Court's approval as applicable, (i) implement the Plan in a timely manner and within the milestones that have been established under the DIP Facilities and the Restructuring Support Agreement, which currently contemplate obtaining confirmation of the Plan and emerging from Chapter 11 in April 2023, and (ii) generate sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases and following emergence from Chapter 11 to meet our contractual obligations and operating needs. As a result of risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, (i) the Company's ability to obtain requisite support for the Plan from various stakeholders, and (ii) the disruptive effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and liquidity making it potentially more difficult to maintain business, financing and operational relationships, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 
 The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated substantially all of the Company's obligations under nearly all of its pre-petition debt instruments. As such, the Company reclassified all pre-petition debt obligations to liabilities subject to compromise on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. For additional discussion regarding the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's debt obligations, see Note 8. Debt. 
 
 The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company continues to focus on cost reduction and risk mitigation actions to address potential macroeconomic headwinds, such as rising global inflation and a potential economic recession or contraction in the near future. The Company may generate additional liquidity through continued cost control initiatives as well as funds provided by selling certain assets or other strategic transactions, potentially subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. If sales decline, the Company s cost control initiatives may include reductions in discretionary spend and reductions in investments in capital and permanent displays.

"Debt," to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2022 Form 10-K . 
 
 Covenants 
 Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the DIP ABL Credit Agreement, and the DIP Term Loan Credit Agreement, in each case as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding and availability under Products Corporation s various revolving credit facilities were as follows: 
 Commitment Borrowing Base Aggregate principal amount outstanding at December 31, 2022 Availability at December 31, 2022 (a) Tranche A DIP ABL Facility due 2023 270.0 102.2 41.8 60.4 SISO DIP ABL Facility due 2023 130.0 130.0 130.0 2020 ABL FILO Term Loans 50.0 50.0 50.0 
 (a) Availability as of December 31, 2022 is based upon the Tranche A Revolving borrowing base then in effect under Tranche A DIP ABL Facility of 102.2 million, less 41.8 million then drawn. 
 
 Sources and Uses 
 
 The Company s principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds that may be available from time to time for borrowing under the DIP ABL Facility and other permissible borrowings. The 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement, the 6.25 Senior Notes Indenture, the DIP ABL Credit Agreement and the DIP Term Loan Credit Agreement contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation's and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 The Company s principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including payments in connection with the purchase of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company s restructuring programs, such as the RGGA Program; severance not otherwise included in the Company s restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; additional debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade. For information regarding certain risks related to the Company s indebtedness and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - "A substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates and the potential discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR could result in an increase to our interest expense." 
 
 The Company s cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the year ended December 31, 2022 were 4.9 million. The Company expects that cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans will be approximately 1.2 million in the aggregate for 2023. For a further discussion, see Note 11, "Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits," to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company s cash taxes paid in the year ended December 31, 2022 to state and foreign jurisdictions were 8.5 million. The Company expects to pay net cash taxes totaling approximately 10 million to 15 million in the aggregate during 2023. For a further discussion, see Note 13, "Income Taxes," to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 The Company s purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2022 were 28.1 million and 13.8 million, respectively. The Company expects that purchases of permanent wall displays will total approximately 55 million to 60 million in the aggregate during 2023 and expects that capital expenditures will total approximately 30 million to 35 million in the aggregate during 2023. 
 The Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending. In the ordinary course of business, the Company s source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows. For certain of the Company s other recent cost reduction initiatives, see COVID-19 Impact on the Company s Business under the Overview section of this "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". 
 Continuing to execute the Company s business initiatives could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company s approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. 
 There can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements on a consolidated basis, as, among other things, the Company s liquidity can be impacted by a number of factors, including its level of sales, costs and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable and inventory, which serve as the principal variables impacting the amount of liquidity available under the DIP ABL Facility. For example, subject to certain exceptions, revolving loans under the DIP ABL Facility must be prepaid to the extent that outstanding loans exceed the applicable borrowing base, consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and real estate. For information regarding certain risks related to the Company s indebtedness and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this 2022 Form 10 -K. 
 If the Company s anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company s products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company s competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, such as due to any further consumption declines that the Company has experienced; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in the brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company s existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company s expenses, including, without limitation, for the purchase of permanent displays, capital expenditures, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company s restructuring programs (such as the RGGA Program), severance not otherwise included in the Company s restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, additional debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation, discontinuin g non-core business lines and/or entering and/or exiting certain territories and/or channels of trade, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company s current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements. For further discussion of certain risks associated with the Company's business and indebtedness, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this 2022 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
 
 The Company does not maintain any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies 
 In the ordinary course of its business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop a different conclusion. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Sales Returns: 
 The Company allows customers to return their unsold products when they meet certain company-established criteria as outlined in the Company s trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, its estimates of sales returns based primarily upon historical rate of actual product returns, planned product discontinuances, new product launches and estimates of customer inventory and promotional sales, which would permit customers to return products based upon the Company s trade terms. The Company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase in accrued liabilities and inventories. 
 Returned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company considers in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as realized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company s estimates if factors such as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company s estimates and expectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company s estimates and expectations. For returned products that the Company expects to resell at a profit, the Company records, in addition to sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales

 and an increase to accrued liabilities for the amount expected to be refunded to the customer, an increase to the asset account used to reflect the Company's right to recover products. The amount of the asset account is valued based upon the former carrying amount of the product (i.e., inventory), less any expected costs to recover the products. As the estimated product returns that are expected to be resold at a profit do not comprise a significant amount of the Company's net sales or assets, the Company does not separately report these amounts. 
 Pension Benefits: 
 The Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the Company, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The Company uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets. 
 The Company applies the "full yield curve" approach, an alternative approach from the single weighted-average discount rate approach, to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits. Under this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement plans. 
 The Company utilized a 4.95 weighted-average discount rate in 2022 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared to a 2.59 weighted-average discount rate in 2021. The Company utilized a 4.43 weighted-average discount rate for the Company s international defined benefit pension plans in 2022, compared to a 1.74 weighted-average discount rate selected in 2021. The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the subsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used for 2022 were primarily due to observed increases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds during 2022. At December 31, 2022, the increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2021 had the effect of decreasing the Company s projected pension benefit obligation by approximately 90.6 million. 
 In selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of plan assets, the plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company s assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and the resulting gains or losses are amortized over future periods as a component of the net periodic benefit cost. For the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets used was 4.50 for both 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used for the Company s international plans was 3.57 for 2022 and 3.46 for 2021. For 2022, the Company realized a loss on pension plan assets of 89.8 million, as compared with expected return on plan assets of 19.4 million. The resulting net deferred loss of 109.2 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The actual return on plan assets for 2022 was below expectations, primarily due to lower returns from investments in developed equity markets. 
 
 The table below reflects the Company s estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return would have had on its 2022 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022 for the Company s principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant: 
 Effect of Effect of 25 basis points increase 25 basis points decrease Net periodic benefit costs Projected pension benefit obligation Net periodic benefit costs Projected pension benefit obligation Discount rate 2.0 (9.3) 1.2 9.6 Expected long-term rate of return (0.2) 1.9

 The rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company s third-party actuarial consultants for pension accounting for the International defined benefit plans. The rate of future compensation increases is no longer applicable for the Company's U.S. defined benefit plans as the UAW Plan was frozen in 2019 and the Revlon Employees Retirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan had plan amendments that effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009. 
 In addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company. 
 To determine the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the "full yield curve" approach described above to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the weighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans: 
 U.S. Plans International Plans Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 4.86 4.67 Service cost (a) 
 N/A 2.14 Interest cost on service cost (a) 
 N/A 2.05 
 (a) Service cost and interest on service cost are no longer applicable for the U.S. plans as the UAW Plan was frozen during 2019. 
 For 2023, the Company is using long-term rates of return on pension plan assets of 5.50 and 4.75 for its U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans, respectively. The Company expects that the impact of the changes in discount rates and the return on plan assets in 2023 will result in net periodic benefit cost of approximately 18.6 million for 2023, compared to 4.7 million of net periodic benefit cost in 2022, excluding the curtailment gain. 
 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets: 
 In determining the fair values of net assets acquired, including trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets, and resulting goodwill related to the Company's business acquisitions, the Company considers, among other factors, the analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. 
 Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including in selecting appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and identifying appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets. 
 Determining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the trade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 5 to 20 years. 
 Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented its brand-centric organizational structure which is built around four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which also represent the Company's reporting segments. Concurrent with the change in reporting segments, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units that have been identified within each reporting segment using a relative fair value allocation approach as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other . Goodwill totaled 562.2 million and 562.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, goodwill of 264.7 million, 87.7 million, 89.2 million and 120.6 million related to the Revlon, Portfolio, Elizabeth Arden and Fragrances segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled 102.6 million and 111.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are

 reviewed annually for impairment using October 1st carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying amounts may not be recovered. Under this standard, the Company annually has the option to first assess qualitatively, based on relevant events and circumstances, whether it is more likely than not that there has been an impairment, or perform a quantitative analysis to assess the existence of any such impairment. If the qualitative analysis shows that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying amount, the quantitative analysis is not required. If the qualitative analysis fails, the quantitative analysis is required. Per the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04, "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment," adopted by the Company as of October 1, 2018, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charge is equal to the amount of such difference. The inputs and assumptions utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. 
 The Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management. Within each of the Elizabeth Arden and Portfolio segments, the Company has identified two reporting units. The two reporting units within the Elizabeth Arden segment are: (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, which includes Elizabeth Arden skin care and color cosmetics brands; and (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, which includes Elizabeth Arden branded fragrances. The two reporting units within the Portfolio segment are: (i) Mass Portfolio, which includes the Company's brands sold primarily through the mass retail channel; and (ii) Professional Portfolio, which includes the Company's brands sold primarily through professional salons. The Company's Revlon and Fragrances reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 16, "Segment Data and Related Information," in the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2022 Form 10-K. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names, are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using October 1 st carrying values, in accordance with ASC 350, and the Company recognizes an impairment if the carrying amount of its intangible assets exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. The Company writes off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for intangible assets in the year in which the asset becomes fully amortized. 
 Finite-lived intangible assets are considered for impairment under ASC 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("ASC 360"), upon the occurrence of certain "triggering events" and the Company recognizes an impairment if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds the Company's estimate of the asset group's undiscounted future cash flows. 
 Impairment testing 
 Goodwill Impairment Testing 
 For 2022, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 using October 1st, 2022 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350, performed a quantitative assessment for five of its reporting units, namely: (i) Revlon (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin Color, (iii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iv) Professional Portfolio and (v) Fragrances reporting units. The Mass Portfolio reporting unit's goodwill was written down to nil in 2020. 
 In performing its 2022 quantitative goodwill assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2022. Consequently, no impairment changes were recognized during the 2022 annual goodwill impairment assessment test. 
 The fair value of the Fragrances reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 12 , while the fair values of the other aforementioned reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 44 to approximately 49 , as of the October 1, 2022 valuation date. 
 The above-mentioned fair values were primarily determined using a weighted average market and income approach. The income approach requires several assumptions including those regarding future sales growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins, and capital expenditures, which are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model. The weighted-average cost of capital used in the income approach ranged from 10.5 to 13.0 , with a perpetual growth rate of 2 . For the market approach, the Company considered the market comparable method based upon total enterprise value multiples of other comparable publicly-traded companies. 
 The key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units for its annual assessment included the expected success of the Company's future new product launches, the Company's achievement of its expansion

 plans, the Company's realization of its cost reduction initiatives and other efficiency efforts. If such plans and assumptions do not materialize as anticipated, or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which the Company's reporting units operate, a resulting change in actual results from the Company's key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the reporting units, which could require the Company to recognize additional impairment charges in future reporting periods. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, the Company performed a quantitative interim goodwill impairment assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, as further specified in Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net". 
 In performing its 2021 annual qualitative goodwill assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of the Revlon reporting unit, expected future cash flows and the results of previous quantitative assessments of the Revlon reporting unit. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its Revlon reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying amount for 2021. 
 In performing its 2021 quantitative goodwill assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iii) Professional Portfolio and (iv) Fragrances reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2021. 
 Finite and Indefinite-lived Intangibles Impairment Testing 
 For 2022, the Company reviewed its finite-lived and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment assessment. No impairment charges were recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite-lived and indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of the 2022 annual impairment tests. 
 The fair values determined as part of the Company s indefinite-lived intangibles quantitative analysis exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 12 to approximately 76 as of the October 1, 2022 valuation date. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, the Company determined certain indicators of potential impairment existed, warranting an interim impairment assessment over its finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, performed in conjunction with the Company's interim impairment testing of goodwill. These indicators included a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions, such as the global supply chain disruptions and inflation, potential increases to costs of raw materials, adverse developments in equity and credit markets, deterioration in some of the economic channels in which the Company operates, the recent trading values of the Company's capital stock and the corresponding decline in the Company s market capitalization. Based upon such assessment, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of 18.7 million and 5.6 million, related to finite lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, within the Company's Mass Portfolio reporting unit, as further specified in Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net". 
 For 2021, no impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment testing. 
 See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net," to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Company's goodwill and intangible assets. 
 Income Taxes: 
 The Company records income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and includes the effect of deferred taxes. The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the Company s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the Company s tax expense and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment. 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a tax benefit for the deferred tax assets. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established. See "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes," for further information.

 The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when management determines that it was more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company is indefinitely reinvested in the accumulated undistributed earnings of all of its foreign subsidiaries. If earnings are repatriated, any excess of financial reporting over tax basis could be subject to federal, state and foreign withholding taxes. At this time, the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis is not practicable. 
 See Note 13, "Income Taxes," to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2022 Form 10-K for further information. 
 Adoption of ASC 852: 
 Beginning on the Petition Date, the Company applied Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification Topic 852, Reorganizations ("ASC 852") in preparing the consolidated financial statements. ASC 852 requires the financial statements, for the periods subsequent to the Petition Date cases and up to and including the period of emergence from Chapter 11 (the Effective Date ), to distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain charges incurred during the bankruptcy proceedings, such as legal and professional fees incurred directly as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding, the write-off of deferred financing costs and discount on debt subject to compromise and other related charges are recorded as Reorganization items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In addition, prepetition obligations that may be impacted by the Chapter 11 process have been classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 as liabilities subject to compromise. These liabilities are reported at the amounts we anticipate will be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. See Note 21.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 b Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. 
 
 Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management's projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 The Company s management, under the oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and in making this assessment used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, the Company s management, under the oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, determined that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ("ICFR"). There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022, as well as the Company's other public documents and statements, may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations, estimates, projections, assumptions, forecasts, plans, anticipations, targets, outlooks, initiatives, visions, objectives, strategies, opportunities, drivers, focus and intents of the Company's management. While the Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the Company cautions that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known and unknown factors, and, of course, it is impossible for the Company to anticipate all factors that could affect its results. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Such statements include, without limitation, the Company's expectations, plans and estimates (whether qualitative or quantitative) as to: 
 (i) any future effects as a result of the pendency and completion of the Company's Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court, including confirmation of the Plan and emergence from Chapter 11 by April 2023 as a privately held company; 
 
 (ii) the Company's debtor-in-possession financing and the various conditions to which such debtor-in-possession financing is subject and the risk that these conditions may not be satisfied for various reasons, including for reasons outside of the Company's control; 
 (iii) the Company's future financial performance and/or sales growth; 
 (iv) matters concerning the impact on the Company from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; 
 
 (v) the effect on sales of decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments, whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise; geopolitical risks, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict; macroeconomic headwinds, such as high inflation or a potential recession/economic contraction; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise, changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among sales channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; inventory de-stocking by certain retail customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in the brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for the purchase of permanent displays, capital expenditures, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, additional debt and/or equity repurc hases, if any, costs related to litigation, discontinuing non-core business lines and/or entering and/or exiting certain territories and/or channels of trade, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses; 
 (vi) the Company's belief that continuing to execute its business initiatives could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including through licensing transactions, if any), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining its approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, any of which, the intended purpose would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities, which activities may be funded with operating revenues, cash on hand, funds available under the DIP Facilities, oth er permissible borrowings and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt; 
 (vii) the Company's plans to remain focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth, including (1) strengthening its iconic brands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; (2) building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its consumers through media channels where they spend the 
 most time; and (3) ensuring availability of its products where consumers shop, both in-store and increasingly online; 
 (viii) the effect of restructuring activities, restructuring costs and charges, the timing of restructuring payments and the benefits from such activities ; 
 (ix) the Company's expected principal sources of funds, including operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the DIP Facilities, a nd other permissible borrowings, as well as the availability of funds from the Company taking certain measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending and the Company's expectation to generate additional liquidity from cost reductions resulting from its cost reduction initiatives, as well as funds provided by selling certain assets; 
 (x) the Company's expected principal uses of funds, including amounts required for payment of operating expenses including in connection with the purchase of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs; severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade (including, without limitation, that the Company may also, from time-to-time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated purchase transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions and that any such retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material); and its estimates of the amount and timing of such operating and other expenses; 
 (xi) the Company's expectation to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables, accounts payable and controls on general and administrative spending; and the Company's belief that in the ordinary course of business, its source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows; 
 (xii) the Company's expectations regarding its future net periodic benefit cost for its U.S. and international defined benefit plans; 
 (xiii) the Company's expectation that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year and the Company's expectations regarding whether it will be required to establish additional valuation allowances on its deferred tax assets; and 
 (xiv) the Company's belief that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, but that in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company's operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company's income for that particular period; 
 
 Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language such as "estimates," "objectives," "visions," "projects," "forecasts," "focus," "drive towards," "plans," "targets," "strategies," "opportunities," "assumptions," "drivers," "believes," "intends," "outlooks," "initiatives," "expects," "scheduled to," "anticipates," "seeks," "may," "will" or "should" or the negative of those terms, or other variations of those terms or comparable language, or by discussions of strategies, targets, long-range plans, models or intentions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and except for the Company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Investors are advised, however, to consult any additional disclosures the Company made or may make in this 2022 Form 10-K and in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, in each case filed with the SEC (which, among other places, can be found on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov, as well as on the Company's corporate website at www.revloninc.com). Except as expressly set forth in this 2022 Form 10-K, the information available from time-to-time on such websites shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this 2022 Form 10-K. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. (See also Item 1A.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Revlon, Inc.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Revlon, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders deficiency, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has filed a Joint Plan of Reorganization of Revlon, Inc. and Its Debtor Affiliates Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of the Fragrances reporting unit 
 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2022 was 562.2 million. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value using a discounted cash flow model. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for the Fragrances reporting unit as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of the Fragrances reporting unit. Specifically, minor changes to key assumptions, including forecasted net sales, forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, and discount rate, could have a significant effect on the Company s assessment of the fair value of the reporting unit. Additionally, specialized skills and knowledge were required to assess these assumptions. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal controls over the Company s goodwill impairment assessment process. These included controls related to the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the development of the assumptions described above. We evaluated the Company s forecasted net sales and EBITDA margins used in the fair value analysis by comparing each to historical results, and forecasted net sales growth rates and EBITDA margins of peer companies based on publicly available market data. We compared the Company s historical forecasted net sales and EBITDA margins to actual results to assess management s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 
 evaluating the appropriateness of the selected guideline public companies by researching the companies and reviewing the business description 
 
 evaluating the discount rate by comparing it to a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1991.

 For 2022, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 using October 1st, 2022 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350, performed a quantitative assessment for of its reporting units, namely: (i) Revlon (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin Color, (iii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iv) Professional Portfolio and (v) Fragrances reporting units. The Mass Portfolio reporting unit's goodwill was written down to in 2020. 
 In performing its 2022 quantitative goodwill assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2022. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, the Company performed a quantitative interim goodwill impairment assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, as further specified in Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net". 
 For 2021, the Company did have any goodwill impairment charges. 
 See Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net," for further information on the Company's goodwill and annual impairment testing.

For the 2022 annual impairment test, the Company reviewed its finite-lived and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment assessment. impairment charges were recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite-lived and indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of the 2022 annual impairment tests. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, the Company determined certain indicators of potential impairment existed, warranting an interim impairment assessment over its finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, performed in conjunction with the Company's interim impairment testing of goodwill. These indicators included a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions such as the global supply chain disruptions and inflation, potential increases to costs of raw materials, adverse developments in equity and credit markets, deterioration in some of the economic channels in which the Company operates, the recent trading values of the Company's capital stock and the corresponding decline in the Company s market capitalization. Based upon such assessment, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of million and million, related to finite lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, within the Company's Mass Portfolio reporting unit, as further specified in Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net". 
 For 2021, impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment testing.

 Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we conducted an evaluation as to whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Each reporting period, the Company assesses its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a liquidity position of million, consisting of: (i) million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (with approximately million held outside the U.S.) ; (ii) million in available borrowing capacity under the DIP ABL Facility (which had million drawn at such date); and less (iii) approximately million of outstanding checks. The Company's evaluation includes its ability to meet its future contractual obligations and other conditions and events that may impact its liquidity.

Voluntary Filing under Chapter 11 
 On June 15, 2022 (the Petition Date ), Revlon Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (collectively, the Debtors ), filed voluntary petitions (the Bankruptcy Petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (such court, the Bankruptcy Court and such cases, the Cases ). On June 16, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the joint administration of the Chapter 11 Cases under the caption In re Revlon Inc, Case No. 22-10760. The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To ensure their ability to continue operating in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors sought from the Bankruptcy Court a variety of first-day relief and "second-day" relief, including authority to obtain debtor-in-possession financing, pay employee wages and benefits, pay vendors and suppliers in the ordinary course for all goods and services provided after the Petition Date and pay fees of professionals involved in the Cases. As of August 2, 2022, all "first-day" and "second-day" relief has been granted by the Bankruptcy Court on a final basis. 
 As previously disclosed by the Company, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company s obligations under the following debt instruments: 
 Term Loan Agreement, dated as of September 7, 2016 (as amended), by and among Products Corporation, the Company, certain lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, related to million outstanding aggregate principal amount of loans ; 
 Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of September 7, 2016 (as amended, the ABL Credit Agreement ), by and among Products Corporation, certain local borrowing subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, the Company, certain lenders party thereto and MidCap Funding IV Trust, as administrative agent and collateral agent, related to million outstanding aggregate principal amount of loans , consisting of million of Tranche A revolving loans, million of 2020 ABL FILO Term Loans and million of SISO Term Loan Facility loans ; 
 BrandCo Credit Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2020 (as amended, the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement ), by and among Products Corporation, the Company, the other loan parties and lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, related to million outstanding aggregate principal amount of loans ; and 
 Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2016 (as amended), between Products Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, governing the Senior Notes which mature on August 1, 2024, of which million aggregate principal amount were outstanding. 
 The debt instruments set forth above provide that as a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the principal and interest due thereunder shall be immediately due and payable. Any efforts to enforce such payment obligations under the debt instruments set forth above are automatically stayed as a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions, and the creditors rights of enforcement in respect of the debt instruments set forth above are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions and resulting event of default under the debt instruments set forth above constituted an event of default under the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement. The 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement lenders agreed not to enforce remedies, subject to the terms and conditions of a First Forbearance Agreement and Second Amendment to the Asset-Based Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of June 15, 2022, and the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement was subsequently repaid in full and discharged. 
 During 2022, the Company implemented a Key Employee Incentive Plan (the KEIP and a Key Employee Retention Plan (the KERP ), each of which has been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Under the KEIP, participants were granted performance-based awards (each, a KEIP Award ), with an individual target award amount (each, a Target Award ), which is the amount that may be earned if performance against the goals for each of the KEIP metrics is earned at target. For 2022, assuming at least threshold performance is achieved for each of the KEIP metrics, the awards may be earned from to of the Target Award based upon performance against 2022 goals for each of the KEIP metrics, and for 2023, the KEIP Awards may be earned from to of the Target Award, based upon performance against 2023 goals for each of the KEIP metrics. The aggregate value of Target Awards eligible to be made to the KEIP participants is approximately million. Payouts under the KEIP Awards may be as low as for all KEIP participants in the aggregate, or as high as approximately million for all KEIP participants in the aggregate, and subject generally to the participant s continued employment through each quarter (and subject to full or partial clawback through the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the date of confirmation of the plan of reorganization). The KEIP Awards are payable in quarterly installments over an -month period. The KERP provides

 -month period, subject generally to the participant s continued employment through each payment date (and subject to clawback through the earlier of June 30, 2023 or the date of confirmation of the plan of reorganization). The aggregate value of the awards payable under the KERP is approximately million. 
 Adoption of ASC 852 
 Beginning on the Petition Date, the Company applied Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification Topic 852, Reorganizations ("ASC 852") in preparing the consolidated financial statements. ASC 852 requires the financial statements, for the periods subsequent to the Petition Date cases and up to and including the period of emergence from Chapter 11 (the Effective Date ), to distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain charges incurred during the bankruptcy proceedings, such as legal and professional fees incurred directly as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding, the write-off of deferred financing costs and discount on debt subject to compromise and other related charges are recorded as Reorganization items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In addition, prepetition obligations that may be impacted by the Chapter 11 process have been classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 as liabilities subject to compromise. These liabilities are reported at the amounts we anticipate will be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. See Note 21. Liabilities Subject to Compromise and Note 22. Reorganization Items, Net for more information regarding these items. 
 Debtors-In-Possession 
 The Debtors are currently operating as debtors-in-possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court has approved motions filed by the Debtors that were designed primarily to mitigate the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company s operations, customers and employees. In general, as debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors are authorized to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to motions filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Court enabled the Debtors to continue to conduct their business activities in the ordinary course by minimizing the impact of the Debtors' bankruptcy filing on day to day operations, including by, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, authorizing the Debtors to: (i) pay employees wages and related obligations; (ii) pay prepetition claims of certain lien claimants and critical vendors; (iii) continue to operate their cash management system in a form substantially similar to pre-petition practice and perform intercompany transactions in the ordinary course; (iv) continue to maintain and administer certain existing customer programs; (v) pay taxes in the ordinary course; (vi) continue their surety bond program; (vii) maintain their insurance program in the ordinary course and (viii) retain certain professionals in the ordinary course. 
 Prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company secured commitments to enter into (i) a superpriority senior secured debtor-in-possession asset-based loan facility (the DIP ABL Facility ), in the maximum aggregate principal amount of million , with certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders and MidCap Funding IV Trust, as administrative agent and collateral agent, (ii) a superpriority senior secured debtor-in-possession term loan facility (the DIP Term Loan Facility ), in the aggregate principal amount of million , with certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders and Jefferies Finance, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and (iii) a superpriority junior secured debtor-in-possession intercompany credit facility (the Intercompany DIP Facility and, together with the DIP ABL Facility and the DIP Term Loan Facility, the DIP Facilities with the Debtors that are BrandCos (as defined in the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement referred to herein) (the BrandCos ). 
 Automatic Stay 
 Subject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Debtors and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims. Absent an order from the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all of the Debtors pre-petition liabilities are subject to settlement under the Bankruptcy Code. See Note 23. Condensed Combined Debtor-In-Possession Financial Information. 
 Restructuring Support Agreement 
 On December 19, 2022, Revlon, Products Corporation, and certain of Revlon s direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Company Parties entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (as amended the Restructuring Support Agreement with certain of the Company s prepetition lenders under the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement (the Consenting BrandCo Lenders ), and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Debtors Chapter 11 Cases (the "Creditors' Committee" and together with the Consenting BrandCo Lenders, the Original Consenting Creditor Parties and, together with the Company Parties, the "Original RSA Parties ). On February 21, 2023, the Company Parties amended and restated the

 proofs of claim have been filed against the Debtors, and as of the Governmental Bar Date, approximately additional proofs of claim have been filed against the Debtors. Such amount includes duplicate claims across multiple Debtor legal entities. These claims will be materially reconciled to amounts recorded in the Company's accounting records. Differences in amounts recorded and claims filed by creditors will be investigated and resolved, including through the filing of objections with the Bankruptcy Court, where appropriate. The Company may ask the Bankruptcy Court to disallow claims that the Company believes are duplicative, have been later amended or superseded, are without merit, are overstated or should be disallowed for other reasons. In addition, as a result of this process, the Company may identify additional liabilities that will need to be recorded or reclassified to liabilities subject to compromise. In light of the substantial number of claims expected to be filed, the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete and likely will continue throughout the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 NYSE Delisting and Transfer to the Over-the-Counter ("OTC") Market 
 On June 16, 2022, the Company received a letter from the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc. NYSE Regulation that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist the Class A Common Stock of the Company from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE in light of the Company s disclosure on June 15, 2022 that it had commenced voluntary petitions for

As such, as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that the property met the criteria to be classified as a long-lived asset held for sale. Per ASC Topic 360, "Property, Plant and Equipment," the Company subsequently measured the long-lived asset at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell, or approximately million, as of December 31, 2022. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company stopped recording depreciation or amortization expense on the asset and will continue to assess the fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting period until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale.

 of its reporting units, namely: (i) Revlon (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin Color, (iii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iv) Professional Portfolio and (v) Fragrances reporting units. The Mass Portfolio reporting unit's goodwill was written down to in 2020. 
 In performing its 2022 quantitative goodwill assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2022. Consequently, impairment changes were recognized during the 2022 annual goodwill impairment assessment test. 
 The fair value of the Fragrances reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately , while the fair values of the other aforementioned reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately to approximately as of the October 1, 2022 valuation date. 
 During the second quarter, the Company determined certain indicators of potential impairment existed that could affect inputs used in its determination of the fair value of goodwill, warranting an interim goodwill impairment analysis. These indicators included a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions, such as the global supply chain disruptions and inflation, potential increases to costs of raw materials, adverse developments in equity and credit markets, deterioration in some of the economic channels in which the Company operates, the recent trading values of the Company's capital stock and the corresponding decline in the Company s market capitalization. 
 As a result, for the second quarter of 2022, the Company examined and performed quantitative interim goodwill impairment assessments for of its aforementioned reporting units with goodwill balances, namely: (i) Revlon; (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color; (iii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances; (iv) Fragrances; and (v) Professional Portfolio. Based upon such assessments, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for the second quarter of 2022. Consequently, impairment changes were recognized during the 2022 interim goodwill impairment assessment. 
 
 2021 Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing 
 
 For 2021, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 using October 1, 2021 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350, performed a qualitative assessment for its Revlon reporting unit and quantitative assessments for its (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iii) Fragrances, and (iv) Professional Portfolio reporting units (as previously noted, the Mass Portfolio reporting unit no longer has any goodwill associated with it starting from the second quarter of 2020). 
 In performing its 2021 annual qualitative goodwill assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of the Revlon reporting unit, expected future cash flows and the results of previous quantitative assessments of the Revlon reporting unit. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its Revlon reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying amount for 2021. 
 In performing its 2021 quantitative goodwill assessments, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, (iii) Professional Portfolio and (iv) Fragrances reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of such aforementioned reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2021. Consequently, additional impairment changes were recognized during the 2021 annual impairment assessment test. 
 
 2022 Annual Impairment Assessment Inputs and Assumptions Considerations 
 
 The above-mentioned fair values were primarily determined using a weighted average market and income approach. The income approach requires several assumptions including those regarding future sales growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins, and capital expenditures, which are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model. The weighted-average cost of capital used in the income approach ranged from to

 (DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION) 
 (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

 , with a perpetual growth rate of . For the market approach, the Company considered the market comparable method based upon total enterprise value multiples of other comparable publicly-traded companies. 
 The key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units for its annual assessment included the expected success of the Company's future new product launches, the Company's achievement of its expansion plans, the Company's realization of its cost reduction initiatives and other efficiency efforts. If such plans and assumptions do not materialize as anticipated, or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which the Company's reporting units operate, a resulting change in actual results from the Company's key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the reporting units, which could require the Company to recognize additional impairment charges in future reporting periods. 
 
 The inputs and assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements.

 Finite-Lived Intangibles 
 2022 Annual and Interim Impairment Tests 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 360, and in conjunction with the performance of its 2022 annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company reviewed its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment. 
 In performing its review, the Company makes judgments about the recoverability of its purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment to its finite-lived intangible assets may exist. The Company also considers several indicators of impairment, including, among other factors, the following: (i) whether there exists any significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset and/or asset group is being used; (ii) whether there exists any projection or forecast demonstrating losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset and/or asset group; and (iii) whether there exists a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset and/or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously-estimated useful life. The carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the finite-lived intangible asset and/or asset group and the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the finite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Based upon such assessment, impairment charges were recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets as a result of the 2022 annual impairment test. 
 During the second quarter, the Company determined certain indicators of potential impairment existed that could affect the recoverability of its finite-lived intangibles, warranting an interim impairment analysis, in accordance with ASC Topic 360. In addition to the aforementioned indicators, the Company assessed the deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions, such as the global supply chain disruptions and inflation. Based upon such assessment, the Company recognized million of non-cash impairment charges related to certain finite-lived intangible assets, within the Company's Mass Portfolio reporting unit during the second quarter of 2022. The recoverability of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets were determined based on the undiscounted cash flows method and fair value was determined based on the multi-period excess earnings method.

 During the Chapter 11 proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court has the ability to issue orders pursuant to sections 361, 363(e) and 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code granting adequate protection payments to secured parties under certain lending facilities in order to protect their interests in the pre-petition collateral. On June 17, 2022, in connection with the DIP Term Loan agreement, the Bankruptcy Court issued an interim order, which was approved on a final basis on August 2, 2022, providing that the holders of tranche Term B-1 loans shall continue to receive quarterly payments in an amount equal to the interest that would otherwise be payable in cash, as well as interest to be paid in kind on the outstanding Term B-1 loans.

During the period, the Company paid the Term B-1 holders million that approximates the quarterly interest that otherwise would have been paid. Furthermore, consistent with the order, the Company accrued million of paid-in-kind interest under the terms of the prepetition 2020 Brandco Term Loan Facility agreement at the non-default rate that would otherwise be owed to the prepetition BrandCo Lenders in accordance with the 2020 Brandco Term Loan Facility agreement. Default interest due under the terms of the prepetition 2020 Brandco Term Loan Facility agreement will accrue and be paid in kind in respect of the Term B-1 Loans in accordance with the 2020 Brandco Term Loan Facility agreement.

 (g) 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions 
 
 On May 7, 2020 (the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date ), Products Corporation entered into a term credit agreement (the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement with Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain financial institutions (the 2020 Facilities Lenders that lenders or the affiliates of lenders under Products Corporation s Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of September 7, 2016 and amended on April 30, 2020 and as amended on the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date, as further described below (as amended to date, the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, collectively referred to as the "2016 Senior Credit Facilities"). Pursuant to the 2020 BrandCo Credit Agreement, the 2020 Facilities Lenders provided Products Corporation with new and roll-up senior secured term loan facilities (the 2020 BrandCo Facilities and, collectively, the "2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility" and, together with the use of proceeds thereof and the Extension Amendment, the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions ). 
 
 Principal and Maturity: The 2020 BrandCo Facilities consist of: (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount outstanding on the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date of million, plus the amount of certain fees and accrued interest that have been capitalized (the 2020 BrandCo Facility (ii) commitments in respect of a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million (the Roll-up BrandCo Facility and (iii) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount outstanding on the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date of million (the Junior Roll-up BrandCo Facility ).

T he Company determined that the roll-up of such 2016 Term Loan Facility lenders into the Roll-up BrandCo Facility and the Junior Roll-up BrandCo Facility represented a debt modification under U.S. GAAP, as the cash flow effect between the amount that Products Corporation owed to the participating lenders under the old debt instrument (i.e., the 2016 Term Loan Facility) and the amount that Products Corporation owed to such lenders after the consummation of the roll-up into the new debt instrument (i.e., the Roll-up BrandCo Facility and the Junior Roll-up BrandCo Facility) on a present value basis was less than 10 and, thus, the debt instruments were not considered to be substantially different within the meaning of ASC 470, Debt, under U.S. GAAP. 
 
 The proceeds of the 2020 BrandCo Facility were used: (i) to repay in full approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under Products Corporation s 2019 Term Loan Facility; (ii) to repay in full and terminate commitments under the 2020 Incremental Facility; and (iii) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the 2020 BrandCo Facilities and the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions. The Company used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Roll-up BrandCo Facility are available prior to the third anniversary of the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date to purchase at par an equivalent amount of any remaining term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility held by the lenders participating in the 2020 BrandCo Facility or their transferees. During the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the three months ended September 30, 2020, certain lenders under the 2016 Term Loan Facility due June 2023, representing million in aggregate principal outstanding, rolled-up to the Roll-up BrandCo Facility and the Junior Roll-up BrandCo Facility due June 2025 , as a result of which the Roll-up BrandCo Facility and the Junior Roll-up BrandCo Facility at September 30, 2020 had an aggregate principal amount outstanding of million, with a remaining capacity for the roll-up of loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility of million.

 Senior Notes held by such Supporting BrandCo Lenders into the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation; 
 Consenting to amendments to the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility to permit the exchange of then-existing Senior Notes for the New BrandCo Second-Lien Term Loans under the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum and the payment of the BrandCo Support and Consent Consideration (as hereinafter defined) ; 
 Consenting to other amendments to the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility and the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to permit the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation to be completed as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum; and 
 Supporting and cooperating with Products Corporation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the BrandCo TSA and the Offering Memorandum, including the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation. 
 
 In connection with such amendments, Products Corporation agreed to provide the following consideration (collectively, the BrandCo Support and Consent Consideration upon the successful consummation of the Exchange Offer: 
 
 1. million aggregate principal amount of New BrandCo Second-Lien Term Loans as a fee to the Supporting BrandCo Lenders under the BrandCo TSA in connection with such Supporting BrandCo Lenders relinquishment of their Roll-up Rights;

Since the expected future undiscounted cash flows under the New BrandCo Second-Lien Term Loans exchanged in the transaction are higher than the net carrying value of the original Senior Notes held by this lender (once prior loans with the same lender have also been considered), gain was recorded and a new effective interest rate was established based on the revised cash flows and the net carrying value of the above-mentioned Senior Notes that were exchanged in the transaction. Following the applicability of the TDR guidance, future interest payments of million as of the day of closing of the Exchange Offer were also included in the carrying value of the restructured debt.

 Interest and Fees : Interest accrues on term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of adjusted LIBOR (which has a floor of plus a margin of or an alternate base rate plus a margin of , at Products Corporation s option, and is payable quarterly, at a minimum. Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility. 
 
 Affirmative and Negative Covenants : The 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Restricted Group s ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of contractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt.

While the 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default, it does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. 
 
 Incremental Revolving Credit Facility under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement: On April 30, 2020, Products Corporation entered into the 2020 Joinder Agreement, with Revlon, certain of their subsidiaries and the Incremental Lenders under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement to provide for the 2020 Incremental Facility. On the closing of the 2020 Incremental Facility, Products Corporation borrowed million of revolving loans for working capital purposes and subsequently on May 11, 2020 Products Corporation also borrowed the additional million of delayed funding revolving loans. On May 28, 2020, the 2020 Incremental Facility was repaid in full, and the commitments thereunder terminated. 
 
 2016 Term Loan Facility Extension Amendment : In connection with the 2020 BrandCo Refinancing Transactions, term loan lenders under the 2016 Term Loan Facility were offered the opportunity to participate at par in the 2020 BrandCo Facilities based on their holdings of term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. Lenders participating in the 2020 BrandCo Facilities, as well as other consenting lenders representing, in the aggregate, a majority of the loans and commitments under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, consented to the Extension Amendment, which, among other things, made certain modifications to the covenants thereof and extended the maturity date of certain consenting lenders term loans to June 30, 2025, subject to (i) the same September 7, 2023 springing maturity date of the non-extended term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility if, on such date, million or more in aggregate principal amount of the non-extended term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility remains outstanding, and (ii) a springing maturity of days prior to the August 1, 2024 maturity date of the

 million or more in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes remains outstanding. The Extension Amendment became effective on the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date. The Extended Term Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of plus per annum, payable not less than quarterly in arrears in cash, consistent with the interest rate applicable to the non-extended term loans. Approximately million of accrued interest outstanding on the 2016 Term Loan Facility was paid on the BrandCo 2020 Facilities Closing Date. The aggregate principal amount of non-extended term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2022 was approximately million. 
 
 (i) Senior Notes 
 
 In August 2016, Revlon Escrow Corporation (the "Escrow Issuer"), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Products Corporation, completed the Senior Notes offering, pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the "Securities Act"), of million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2024. The Senior Notes are unsecured and were initially issued by the Escrow Issuer to the initial purchasers under an Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2016 (the " Senior Notes Indenture"), between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the " Senior Notes Trustee"). The Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2024. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at per annum, paid every through maturity on each February 1 and August 1. The proceeds from the Senior Notes were released from escrow on the September 7, 2016 The Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date (the "Escrow Release"). On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, the Escrow Issuer was merged with and into Products Corporation and in connection with the Escrow Release, Products Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the " Senior Notes Guarantors"), and the Senior Notes Trustee entered into a supplemental indenture (the " Senior Notes Supplemental Indenture") to the Senior Notes Indenture, pursuant to which Products Corporation assumed the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Guarantors jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis (the " Senior Notes Guarantees"). The Senior Notes Guarantors are the same entities that are subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities. 
 
 In December 2016, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original Senior Notes for million of new Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the " Senior Notes"). 
 
 Ranking : The Senior Notes are Products Corporation s senior, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations, ranking: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of Products Corporation s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of Products Corporation s and the Senior Notes Guarantors future subordinated indebtedness; and (iii) effectively junior to all of Products Corporation s and the Senior Notes Guarantors existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under Products Corporation s 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 2019 Term Loan Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees are: (i) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of the Company s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes; and (ii) pari passu in right of payment with liabilities of the Senior Notes Guarantors other than expressly subordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees rank effectively junior to indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation s foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (including the 2021 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility) (the " Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"), none of which guarantee the Senior Notes. 
 
 Optional Redemption : Products Corporation may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at par. 
 
 All redemptions (and notices thereof) may be subject to various conditions precedent, and redemption dates specified in such notices may be extended so that such conditions precedent may be fulfilled (to the extent redemption on such dates is otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture). 
 
 Change of Control : Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Notes at a purchase price of of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase. 
 
 Certain Covenants : The Senior Notes Indenture imposes certain limitations on Products Corporation s and the Senior Notes Guarantors ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, make certain investments and make repayments on indebtedness that is

 These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default. In addition, if during any period of time the Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard Poor s and Moody s Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants regarding limitations on debt, limitations on restricted payments, limitation on guarantees by restricted subsidiaries, limitation on transactions with affiliates, certain provisions of the successor company covenant, limitation on asset sales and limitation on dividends from restricted subsidiaries. 
 
 Under the BrandCo TSA, Supporting BrandCo Lenders agreed to take certain actions to facilitate the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, including, among other things: (i) consenting to amendments to the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility to permit the exchange of Existing Senior Notes for, among other things, the New BrandCo Second-Lien Term Loans under the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum and the payment of the BrandCo Support and Consent Consideration and (ii) consenting to other amendments to the 2020 BrandCo Term Loan Facility and the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to permit the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation to be completed as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum. In connection with such amendments, Products Corporation agreed to provide, among other things, million aggregate principal amount of New BrandCo Second-Lien Term Loans to one of the Supporting BrandCo Lenders in exchange for million aggregate principal amount of Products Corporation s Senior Notes held by such Supporting BrandCo Lender as consideration upon the successful consummation of the Exchange Offer. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Notes at December 31, 2022 was million, classified within debt subject to compromise.

 , and highly compensated participants to contribute up to , of eligible compensation through payroll deductions, subject to certain annual dollar limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). The Company matches employee contributions at dollar for each dollar contributed up to the first of eligible compensation. The Company made cash matching contributions to the Savings Plan of million and million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company also offers a non-qualified defined contribution plan (the "Excess Savings Plan") providing benefits for certain U.S. employees who are in excess of IRS limitations. These non-qualified defined contribution benefits are funded from the Company's general assets. Beginning January 1, 2022, the following changes are in effect: (i) the Company will match employee contributions at dollar for each dollar contributed up to the first of eligible compensation; (ii) highly compensated participants may contribute up to of eligible compensation through payroll deductions to the Savings Plan; and (iii) highly compensated participants may contribute up to to the Excess Saving Plan when the maximum contributions to the Savings Plan have been met. 
 
 The Company s qualified and non-qualified defined contribution savings plans for its U.S.-based employees contain a discretionary profit-sharing component that enables the Company, should it elect to do so, to make discretionary profit-sharing contributions. For 2021, the Company made discretionary profit-sharing contributions to the Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan of million of which million was paid in 2021 and million was paid in January 2022, or up to of eligible compensation, which was credited on a quarterly basis. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company no longer made discretionary profit-sharing contributions to the Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan. 
 
 Pension Benefits: 
 
 In 2009, Products Corporation s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the Revlon Employees Retirement Plan, which covered a substantial portion of the Company's employees in the U.S.) and its non-qualified pension plan (the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan) were amended to cease future benefit accruals under such plans after December 31, 2009. No additional benefits have accrued since December 31, 2009, other than interest credits on participant account balances under the cash balance program of the Company s U.S. pension plans. Also, service credits for vesting and early retirement eligibility will continue to accrue in accordance with the terms of the respective plans. In 2010, the Company amended its Canadian defined benefit pension plan (the Affiliated Revlon Companies Employment Plan) to reduce future benefit accruals under such plan after December 31, 2010. Additionally, while the Company closed its U.K. defined pension plan to new entrants in 2002, then-existing participants continue to accrue pension benefits. 
 
 Products Corporation also sponsors U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, has non-qualified pension plans that provide benefits for certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees, and for U.S. employees in excess of IRS limitations in the U.S. and in certain limited cases contractual benefits for certain former officers of the Company. These non-qualified plans are funded from the Company's general assets. 
 
 Post-retirement Benefits: 
 
 The Company previously sponsored an unfunded retiree benefit plan, which provides death benefits payable to beneficiaries of a very limited number of former employees. Participation in this plan was limited to participants enrolled as of December 31, 1993. The Company also administers an unfunded medical insurance plan on behalf of Revlon Holdings, certain costs of which have been apportioned to Revlon Holdings under the transfer agreements among Revlon, Products Corporation and MacAndrews Forbes.

 Pension Plan Assumptions: 
 Rate of future compensation increases N/A N/A 
 
 The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the Company s net periodic benefit (income) cost of the Company s U.S. and International pension plans during the respective years: 
 U.S. Plans International Plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 Discount rate Expected long-term return on plan assets Rate of future compensation increases N/A N/A 
 
 The Company uses the "full yield curve" method to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefits. Under the "full yield curve" method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other post-retirement plans. 
 In selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its pension plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of pension plan assets, the pension plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the pension plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of pension plan assets, the Company s assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. Using the aforementioned methodologies, the Company selected a and weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption during 2022 for the U.S. and International pension plans, respectively.

 to business days. The Company classifies common and collective fund investments within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether certain criteria are met. Some common and collective funds for which fair value is not readily determinable are recorded using NAV per share or its equivalent, as permitted by the practical expedient, provided by ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset per Share (or Its Equivalent) (the ASU No. 2015-07 practical expedient ). These investments are not assigned a fair value hierarchy level. 
 Hedge funds: The hedge funds asset class includes hedge funds that primarily invest in a grouping of equities, fixed income instruments, currencies, derivatives and/or commodities. The fair values of investments included in the hedge funds class are determined using NAV provided by the administrator of the funds. The hedge fund investments in the hedge funds asset class may employ leverage, generally can be sold on a quarterly or monthly basis and have redemption notice periods that range up to business days. Hedge fund investments are generally recorded using NAV per share or its equivalent, as permitted by the ASU No. 2015-07 practical expedient, and are not assigned a fair value hierarchy level. 
 Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

 tranches on each of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, while Tier 2 awards are payable in cash in one lump-sum on December 31, 2020, in each case subject to certain earlier vesting for a change of control or termination of employment without cause, as described below. As of September 5, 2019, the Company approved a total of time-based RSUs under Tier 1 of the 2019 TIP, which were scheduled to vest in equivalent amounts on each of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, subject to continued employment (the 2019 TIP RSUs ). The Company granted approximately TIP awards during 2021, with both a cash component and RSU component, all pursuant to the Stock Plan. These TIP awards are 100 time-based and vests as follows: in June 2022; in June 2023. The awards are subject to continued employment through the respective vesting dates. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, a total of time-based RSUs under Tier 1 of the 2019 TIP had been granted and are outstanding. 
 
 The 2019 TIP RSUs vest in full upon an involuntary termination, other than if due to cause; provided that if a change of control occurs or a brand or business segment is sold and (i) the impacted grantee accepts an offer of employment from the buyer, then: (A) if the buyer assumes the 2019 TIP RSUs, the grantee will continue to vest in the assumed awards (with the grantee having the continued right to accelerated vesting upon an involuntary termination, other than if due to cause); and (B) if the buyer does not assume the 2019 TIP RSUs, the grantee s 2019 TIP RSUs will vest upon closing the change of control; and (ii) the impacted grantee declines an offer of employment from the buyer for substantially comparable total compensation and benefits, the grantee will forfeit their unvested 2019 TIP RSUs (collectively, the Special Vesting Rules ). 
 
 The 2019 TIP also provides for the following cash-based awards payable to certain employees, subject to continued employment through the respective vesting dates: (i) Tier 1 - million payable in equal installments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021; and (ii) Tier 2 - million payable in installment as of December 31, 2020. Such cash-based awards were eligible for vesting following a termination without cause or due to death or disability or if not assumed upon a change in control (the "Special Vesting Rules"). The total amount amortized for this Tier 1 cash-based award since the program's inception and through December 31, 2022 is approximately million, of which million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022, within "Acquisition, integration and divestiture costs" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Program 
 The Company's LTIP RSUs consist of time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are generally scheduled to vest ratably over a -year service period, while performance-based RSUs are scheduled to vest based on the achievement of certain Company performance metrics and cliff-vest at the completion of a -year performance period. 
 The fair value of the LTIP and TIP RSUs is determined based on the NYSE closing share price on the grant date. 
 In connection with the announcement of the 2019 TIP, in August 2019 the Company also approved applying the Special Vesting Rules to outstanding, pre-existing LTIP RSUs, except that accelerated vesting in the case of termination of employment without cause will apply only to any tranche of outstanding, pre-existing LTIP RSUs scheduled to vest in the -month period following termination, with any future tranches being forfeited. Prior to the approval of these Special Vesting Rules, while the outstanding, pre-existing LTIP RSUs would generally have accelerated vesting upon a change of control, they did not feature accelerated vesting for termination and, in such cases, they were entirely forfeited upon termination. 
 During 2022, the Company granted time-based RSU awards under the Stock Plan (the "2021 LTIP RSUs") to certain employees. During 2021, the Company granted approximately million time-based RSU awards under the Stock Plan (the "2021 LTIP RSUs") to certain employees. The 2021 LTIP RSUs are 100 time-based and vests as follows: in March 2022; in March 2023; in March 2024. 
 
 Acceleration of Vesting 
 Under the aforementioned provisions for acceleration of vesting, as of December 31, 2022 and since the time these provisions became effective in September 2019, LTIP RSUs and 2019 TIP Tier 1 RSUs were vested on an accelerated basis due to involuntary terminations, resulting in accelerated amortization of approximately million. In addition, since the time these provisions became effective in September 2019 and through December 31, 2022 under the same accelerated vesting provisions, the Company also recorded approximately million of accelerated amortization in connection with the cash portion of the 2019 TIP Tier 1 and Tier 2 awards that were vested on an accelerated basis due to involuntary terminations. accelerated amortization was recorded in connection with the LTIP RSUs, the 2019 TIP RSUs and the 2019 TIP cash portion during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 The Company's provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The Company s tax provision changes based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographical level and mix of earnings; enacted tax legislation; foreign, state and local income taxes; tax audit settlements; and the interaction of various global tax strategies. 
 The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of million (Products Corporation - million) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and a provision for income taxes of million (Products Corporation - million) for the year ended December 31, 2021. The million increase (Products Corporation - million) in the provision from income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings, net change of valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets for certain jurisdictions.

 (a) Net operating loss carryforwards - U.S. for Products Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were million and million, respectively. 
 
 In assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, the Company continually evaluates all available positive and negative evidence to assess the amount of deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not to realize a benefit. For any deferred tax asset in excess of the amount for which it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is a non-cash charge, and it in no way limits the Company's ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, including its ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforward amounts. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company concluded that, based on its evaluation of objectively verifiable evidence, it is not more likely than not that its net federal deferred tax assets are recoverable and has recorded valuation allowance against them. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the key assumptions used to determine positive and negative evidence included the Company s cumulative taxable loss for the past , future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, the implementation of tax planning strategies, as well as the Company's cost reduction initiatives and efficiency efforts. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a charge of million (2021 - million) as a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. 
 
 A valuation allowance has been established for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of the Company's management, it was more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized. At December 31, 2022, the deferred tax valuation allowance primarily represented amounts for its net U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which the Company has determined it is more likely than not they will not be recoverable, foreign jurisdictions where, as of the end of 2022, the Company had a cumulative loss, and for certain U.S. state jurisdictions where the Company had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes which may expire prior to being utilized. The deferred tax valuation allowance increased by million and million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2022 was primarily associated with the assessment of the realizability of the federal and state deferred tax assets for which the Company has determined it is more likely than not that it will not receive a benefit.

 million, of which million are foreign and million are domestic (federal). These losses expire in future years as follows: 2023- million; 2024- million; 2025 and beyond- million; and no expiration- million. The Company also has certain state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2023 and 2041. The Company could receive the benefit of such tax loss carryforwards only to the extent it has taxable income during the carryforward periods in the applicable tax jurisdictions. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were no consolidated federal net operating losses available from the MacAndrews Forbes Group (as hereinafter defined) from periods prior to the March 25, 2004 deconsolidation (as described below). The Company has acquired entities that had carryforward balances for tax losses, tax credits and other tax attributes at the time of the acquisition. U.S. federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions impose limitations on the amount of these tax losses, tax credits and other carryforward balances that may be utilized after an acquisition. The Company has evaluated the impact of these limitations and has established a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company expects will be realized. 
 The Company remains subject to examination of its income tax returns in various jurisdictions, including: the U.S. (federal) for the tax years ended December 31, 2019 and forward; Spain for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 and forward; Canada for the tax years ended December 31, 2016 and forward; Australia for the tax years ended December 31, 2019 and forward; Switzerland for the tax years ended June 30, 2018 and forward; Japan for the tax years ended December 31, 2018 and forward; and the U.K. for the tax years ended December 31, 2020 and forward. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of million and million, respectively, including million and million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties. Of the million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, million would affect the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized, and the remaining million would affect the Company's deferred tax accounts. The Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income an expense of million and million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 In addition, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in 2023 by approximately million due to the expiration of statutes of limitation. 
 As a result of the closing of the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions (as hereinafter defined in Note 19, "Related Party Transactions - Tax Sharing Agreements"), as of March 25, 2004, Revlon, Products Corporation and their U.S. subsidiaries were no longer included in the affiliated group of which MacAndrews Forbes was the common parent (the "MacAndrews Forbes Group") for federal income tax purposes. Revlon Holdings (as hereinafter defined in Note 19, "Related Party Transactions - Transfer Agreements"), Revlon, Products Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, and MacAndrews Forbes Incorporated entered into a tax sharing agreement (as subsequently amended and restated, the "MacAndrews Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement"), for taxable periods beginning on or after January 1, 1992 through and including March 25, 2004, during which Revlon and Products Corporation or a subsidiary of Products Corporation was a member of the MacAndrews Forbes Group. In these taxable periods, Revlon's and Products Corporation's federal taxable income and loss were included in such group's consolidated tax return filed by MacAndrews Forbes Incorporated. During such period, Revlon and Products Corporation were also included in certain state and local tax returns of MacAndrews Forbes Incorporated or its subsidiaries.

 Following the closing of the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions, Revlon became the parent of a new consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and Products Corporation's federal taxable income and loss are included in such group's consolidated tax returns. Accordingly, Revlon and Products Corporation entered into a tax sharing agreement (the "Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement") pursuant to which Products Corporation is required to pay to Revlon amounts equal to the taxes that Products Corporation would otherwise have had to pay if Products Corporation were to file separate federal, state or local income tax returns, limited to the amount, and payable only at such times, as Revlon will be required to make payments to the applicable taxing authorities.

 brand-centric reporting units that are aligned with its organizational structure based on global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which represent the Company's reporting segments. 
 The Company's management evaluates segment profit for each of the Company's reportable segments. The Company allocates corporate expenses to each reportable segment to arrive at segment profit, and these expenses are included in the internal measure of segment operating performance. The Company defines segment profit as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt, miscellaneous expenses and reorganization items, net. Segment profit also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments' underlying operating performance. Such items are shown below in the table reconciling segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. 
 The accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, "Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." The Company's assets and liabilities are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the Consolidated Financial Statements; thus, no additional information regarding assets and liabilities of the Company s reportable segments is produced for the Company's Chief Executive Officer or included in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The Reimbursement Agreements may be terminated by either party on days' notice. The Company does not intend to request services under the Reimbursement Agreements unless their costs would be at least as favorable to the Company as could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. 
 The Company participates in MacAndrews Forbes' directors and officers liability insurance program (the "D O Insurance Program"), as well as its other insurance coverages, such as property damage, business interruption, liability and

 million in respect of its participation in the D O Insurance Program. During 2022, the Company made payments in respect of its participation in the D O Insurance Program. Consequently, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has balance outstanding in respect of its participation in the D O Insurance Program. 
 
 In June 1992, Revlon and Products Corporation entered into an asset transfer agreement Transfer Agreement with Revlon Holdings Inc. ("Revlon Holdings"), which is an affiliate of MacAndrews Forbes. Revlon Holdings transferred certain assets to Revlon and Products Corporation and Revlon and Products Corporation assumed all of the liabilities of Revlon Holdings, other than certain specifically excluded assets and liabilities. 
 The net activity related to services purchased under the Transfer and Reimbursement Agreements during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was less than million income and million income, respectively. As of both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a receivable balance of million from MacAndrews Forbes were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet for transactions subject to the Transfer and Reimbursement Agreements. 
 
 Tax Sharing Agreements 
 
 As a result of a debt-for-equity exchange transaction completed in March 2004 (the "2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions"), as of March 25, 2004, Revlon, Products Corporation and their U.S. subsidiaries were no longer included in the MacAndrews Forbes Group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Note 13, "Income Taxes," for further discussion on these agreements and related transactions in 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Registration Rights Agreement 
 
 Prior to the consummation of Revlon's initial public equity offering in February 1996, Revlon and Revlon Worldwide Corporation (which subsequently merged into REV Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews Forbes ("REV Holdings")), the then direct parent of Revlon entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In February 2003, MacAndrews Forbes executed a joinder agreement to the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which REV Holdings, MacAndrews Forbes and certain transferees of Revlon's Common Stock held by REV Holdings (the "Holders") have the right to require Revlon to register under the Securities Act all or part of the Class A Common Stock owned by such Holders, including, without limitation, the shares of Class A Common Stock purchased by MacAndrews Forbes in connection with Revlon's 2003 million equity rights offering and the shares of Class A Common Stock which were issued to REV Holdings upon its conversion of all shares of its Class B Common Stock in October 2013 (a "Demand Registration"). In connection with closing the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions and pursuant to the 2004 Investment Agreement, MacAndrews Forbes executed a joinder agreement that provided that MacAndrews Forbes would also be a Holder under the Registration Rights Agreement and that all shares acquired by MacAndrews Forbes pursuant to the 2004 Investment Agreement are deemed to be registrable securities under the Registration Rights Agreement. This included all of the shares of Class A Common Stock acquired by MacAndrews Forbes in connection with Revlon s March 2006 million rights offering of shares of its Class A Common Stock and related private placement to MacAndrews Forbes, and Revlon s January 2007 million rights offering of shares of its Class A Common Stock and related private placement to MacAndrews Forbes. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, in 2009 Revlon registered under the Securities Act all shares of Class A Common Stock issued to MacAndrews Forbes in the 2009 Exchange Offer, in which, among other things, Revlon issued to MacAndrews Forbes shares of Class A Common Stock at a ratio of one share of Class A Common Stock for each of outstanding principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Subordinated Term Loan that MacAndrews Forbes contributed to Revlon. 
 Revlon may postpone giving effect to a Demand Registration for a period of up to days if Revlon believes such registration might have a material adverse effect on any plan or proposal by Revlon with respect to any financing, acquisition, recapitalization, reorganization or other material transaction, or if Revlon is in possession of material non-public information that, if publicly disclosed, could result in a material disruption of a major corporate development or transaction then pending or

 of the capital stock of Products Corporation's and its domestic subsidiaries' first-tier foreign subsidiaries. See Note 8, "Debt," for a discussion of the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company engaged several companies in which MacAndrews Forbes had a controlling interest to provide the Company with various ordinary course business services. These services included processing approximately million and million of coupon redemptions for the Company's retail customers for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for which the Company incurred fees of approximately million and million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and other similar advertising, coupon redemption and raw material supply services, for which the Company had net payables aggregating to approximately million and million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a payable balance of approximately million and million, respectively, were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet for the aforementioned coupon redemption services. The Company believes that its engagement of each of these affiliates was on arm's length terms, taking into account each firm's expertise in its respective field, and that the fees paid or received were at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated parties.

 In the matter captioned In re Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, 520 F. Supp. 3d 390 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (the Citi Decision ), the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court held that the wire transfers were final and complete transactions not subject to revocation. Citi appealed the Citi Decision. Citi also asserted subrogation rights, but, as yet, there has been no determination of those rights, if any, under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement and Revlon has not taken a position on this issue. In these circumstances, prior to the Petition Date, the Company continued to make the scheduled payments under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement as if the full amount of the 2016 Term Loan Agreement remained outstanding. Following the Petition Date, the Company's payments under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement are automatically stayed as a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions. 
 
 Subsequently, in the matter captioned Citibank, N.A. v. Brigade Cap. Mgmt., LP, No. 21-487, 2022 WL 4102227 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2022), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit reversed the District Court s ruling in the Citi Decision, holding that Citi is entitled to return of the mistakenly transferred funds. The defendants petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc was denied on October 12, 2022. All of the mistakenly transferred funds have been returned to Citibank and the case was dismissed with prejudice on January 19, 2023.

The August 12, 2022 Adversary Complaint arises out of the District Court s judgment entered on February 16, 2021 in the Citibank Litigation described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because the Second Circuit vacated the District Court s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings In re Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers , No. 21-487 (2d Cir. 2022)), the parties agreed to stay the adversary proceeding pending disposition of the District Court litigation. On February 21, 2023, the District Court so ordered the Joint Stipulation and Order for Voluntary Dismissal of Adversary Proceeding, dismissing the adversary proceeding in its entirety.

 Exhibit 99.1 

 REVLON, INC. 
 Q4 2022 and 2023 AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY 
 
 I. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES 
 
 The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the Company s independent auditor, KPMG LLP KPMG LLP or the independent auditor ), in order to assure that KPMG LLP s provision of such services does not impair its independence. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent auditor is within the pre-approved services and dollar limits set forth in the appendices attached to this Policy, the provision of such service by the independent auditor will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
 
 The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit Services, Audit-Related Services, Tax Services and All Other Services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee for 2022 and 2023, as well as the applicable dollar limits for the particular services. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services that may be provided by the independent auditor without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may revise the list of general pre-approved services from time to time. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management. 
 
 II. DELEGATION 
 
 The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members for Audit-Related, Tax Services or All Other Services (each as defined below) to be provided by the independent auditor (but excluding Annual Audit Services referred to in Section III below and prohibited services referred to in Section VII below). Specifically, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may approve services which are not Annual Audit Services referred to in Section III below or prohibited services referred to in Section VII below if the fees as to any applicable project will not exceed 35,000, provided that the independent auditor complies with any applicable rules or requirements of this Policy to document the services to the Audit Committee and to discuss such services with the Audit Committee. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at least quarterly on the services provided by KPMG LLP and the approximate fees paid or payable to KPMG LLP for such services during the preceding quarter, including a report on any services pre-approved during such quarter by the Chairman of the Audit Committee pursuant to this Section II. 
 
 III. AUDIT SERVICES 
 
 The terms and fees of the annual Audit Services engagement, including, without limitation, the independent auditor's services in connection with the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and the independent auditor's review of the Company's financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, are subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope or other matters, if necessary, are also subject to Audit Committee approval. 

Exhibit 99.1 

In addition to the foregoing annual Audit Services engagement, the Audit Committee may grant pre-approval for other Audit Services, which are those services that are normally provided by the independent auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements and other services that generally only the independent auditor reasonably can provide, such as comfort letters, statutory audits, attest services, consents and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the other Audit Services listed in Appendix A , provided that such services do not exceed the pre-approved fees set forth on Appendix A . All other Audit Services not listed in Appendix A must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
 
 IV. AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES 
 
 Audit-Related Services are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company s financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor, and in each case which are not covered by the Audit Services described in Section III. Such services could include, among other things, employee benefit plan audits, due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, accounting consultations and audits in connection with acquisitions, attest services and internal control reviews that are not required by statute and regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. The Audit Committee believes that the provision of Audit-Related Services does not impair the auditor s independence, and has pre-approved the Audit-Related Services listed in Appendix B , provided that such services do not exceed the pre-approved fees set forth on Appendix B . All other Audit-Related Services not listed in Appendix B must be specifically pre- approved by the Audit Committee, except to the extent covered by the delegation of authority under Section II above. As to all non- audit internal control services to be provided to the Company, the independent auditor must (1) describe in writing to the Audit Committee the scope of the proposed non-audit internal control service (2) discuss with the Audit Committee any potential effects on the independent auditor's independence that could be caused by the independent auditor's performance of the proposed non-audit internal control service and (3) document the substance of such discussions with the Audit Committee. 
 
 V. TAX SERVICES 
 
 The Audit Committee believes that the independent auditor can provide certain Tax Services to the Company, such as (i) tax compliance (e.g., preparing original and amended state and federal corporate tax returns, planning for estimated tax payments and preparation of tax return extensions) (ii) tax advice and (iii) tax planning, without impairing the auditor s independence. Tax advice and tax planning could include, without limitation, assistance with tax audits and appeals, tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions and employee benefit plans and request for rulings or technical advice from taxing authorities. However, the Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the independent auditor (or any affiliate of the independent auditor) in connection with the provision of any prohibited tax service listed in Exhibit 1 to the Company or its affiliates, as the PCAOB has determined that such prohibited tax services would impair the independent auditor's independence. 
 
 The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Tax Services listed in Appendix C , provided that such services do not exceed the pre- approved fees set forth on Appendix C . All other Tax 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Services for the Company not listed in Appendix C must be specifically pre- approved by the Audit Committee, except to the extent covered by the delegation of authority under Section II above, provided that the independent auditor complies with any applicable rules and the following requirements to document the applicable Tax Services to the Audit Committee and to discuss such services with the Audit Committee. 
 
 As to all Tax Services for the Company, the independent auditor must (1) describe in writing to the Audit Committee the scope of the proposed Tax Service, the proposed fee structure for the engagement and any agreement between the independent auditor and the Company and its affiliates relating to the proposed Tax Service (2) describe in writing to the Audit Committee any compensation arrangement or other agreement, such as a referral agreement, a referral fee or fee-sharing arrangement, between the independent auditor or any of its affiliates and any person (other than the Company and its affiliates) with respect to the promoting, marketing or recommending of any transaction covered by the Tax Service (3) discuss with the Audit Committee any potential effects of the proposed Tax Services on the independent auditor s independence and (4) document the substance of such discussions with the Audit Committee. 
 
 VI. ALL OTHER SERVICES 
 
 The Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit services classified as All Other Services that it believes are routine and recurring services, and would not impair the auditor s independence, provided such All Other Services may not include Audit Services referred to in Section III above or prohibited services referred to in Section VII below. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other Services listed in Appendix D , provided that such services do not exceed the pre-approved fees set forth on Appendix D . Permissible All Other Services other than those listed in Appendix D must be specifically pre- approved by the Audit Committee, except to the extent covered by the delegation of authority under Section II above. 
 
 VII. PROHIBITED SERVICES 
 
 The Company will not retain its independent auditors for any services that are prohibited services as defined by applicable statutes or regulations, as may be in effect from time to time, including, without limitation, those services prohibited by Section 201(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC's or the PCAOB's rules and regulations and such other rules and regulations as may be promulgated thereunder from time to time. Attached to this policy as Exhibit 1 is a list of the SEC s and PCAOB's prohibited non- audit services, including prohibited tax services. 
 
 VIII. PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS 
 
 Pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent auditor will be established annually by the Audit Committee. Any services proposed to be provided by the independent auditors during a fiscal year exceeding these levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
 
 IX. PROCEDURES 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Requests or applications to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee may be submitted to the Audit Committee by the independent auditor and any of the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller or General Counsel.
