FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that include anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, expect, continue, should, could, may, plan, project, predict, will, potential, forecast, target, guidance, outlook or other similar terminology. Various factors may cause actual results to be materially different than the suggested outcomes within forward-looking statements; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 The ability to implement our business strategy, including our carbon emission reduction goals; 
 State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements, including those related to climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices; 
 The extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirements related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for required closure of certain ash impoundments, are uncertain and difficult to estimate; 
 The ability to recover eligible costs, including amounts associated with coal ash impoundment retirement obligations, asset retirement and construction costs related to carbon emissions reductions, and costs related to significant weather events, and to earn an adequate return on investment through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process; 
 The costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process; 
 The impact of extraordinary external events, such as the pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19, and their collateral consequences, including the disruption of global supply chains or the economic activity in our service territories; 
 Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; 
 Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from sustained downturns of the economy, reduced customer usage due to cost pressures from inflation or fuel costs, and the economic health of our service territories or variations in customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts, natural gas building and appliance electrification, and use of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies; 
 Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures, natural gas electrification, and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in a reduced number of customers, excess generation resources as well as stranded costs; 
 Advancements in technology; 
 Additional competition in electric and natural gas markets and continued industry consolidation; 
 The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with climate change; 
 Changing investor, customer and other stakeholder expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns and costs related thereto; 
 The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers including direct or indirect effects to the company resulting from an incident that affects the United States electric grid or generating resources; 
 Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and transmission activities; 
 The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply; 
 The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist or other attack, war, vandalism, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches, operational events, information technology failures or other catastrophic events, such as fires, explosions, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences; 
 The inherent risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks, including the financial stability of third-party service providers; 
 The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; 
 The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions, an individual utility s generation mix, and general market and economic conditions; 
 Credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be different from what is expected; 
 Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 Construction and development risks associated with the completion of the Duke Energy Registrants capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, timing and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or at all; 
 Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; 
 The ability to control operation and maintenance costs; 
 The level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions; 
 The ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs; 
 Employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key personnel; 
 The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation holding company (the Parent); 
 The performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities, as well as the successful sale of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups; 
 The effect of accounting and reporting pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies and the SEC; 
 The impact of United States tax legislation to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our credit ratings; 
 The impacts from potential impairments of goodwill or equity method investment carrying values; 
 Asset or business acquisitions and dispositions may not yield the anticipated benefits; 
 The actions of activist shareholders could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, or cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock; and 
 Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the Duke Energy Registrants' reports filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's website at sec.gov. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than described. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Duke Energy Registrants expressly disclaim an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

DUKE ENERGY 
 
 General 
 Duke Energy was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also Subsidiary Registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to such reports. 
 The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy s website at duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
 
 Business Segments 
 Duke Energy's segment structure includes two reportable business segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU I). The remainder of Duke Energy s operations is presented as Other. Commercial Renewables is reported as discontinued operations and is no longer a reportable segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 2 for further details. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments. The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy s business segments, as well as Other. 
 ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 EU I conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. EU I provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 8.2 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately 92,000 square miles across six states with a total estimated population of 26 million. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. 
 During 2021, Duke Energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a 19.9 minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction was completed following two closings. Additionally, in November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay, which was moved to EU I. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Dispositions," for additional information. 
 EU I is also a joint owner in certain electric transmission projects. EU I has a 50 ownership interest in DATC, a partnership with American Transmission Company, formed to design, build and operate transmission infrastructure. DATC owns 72 of the transmission service rights to Path 15, an 84-mile transmission line in central California. EU I also has a 50 ownership interest in Pioneer, which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. The following map shows the service territory for EU I as of December 31, 2022.

BUSINESS 

The electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the NRC, the NCUC, the PSCSC, the FPSC, the IURC, the PUCO and the KPSC. 
 The following table represents the distribution of GWh billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Duke Duke Duke Duke Duke Energy Energy Energy Energy Energy Carolinas Progress Florida Ohio Indiana Residential 33 26 47 38 30 General service 33 22 34 38 27 Industrial 23 16 8 22 28 Total retail sales 89 64 89 98 85 Wholesale and other sales 11 36 11 2 15 Total sales 100 100 100 100 100 
 The number of residential and general service customers within the EU I service territory is expected to increase over time. Sales growth is expected within the service territory but continues to be impacted by adoption of energy efficiencies and self-generation. Migration into EU I s service territories and continued remote work contributed to higher residential sales volumes in 2022 while higher data center usage contributed to growth in commercial sales volumes. This was partially offset by lower industrial sales volumes impacted by certain automotive customers experiencing supply chain constraints along with reduced volumes in the steel sector. The impact on customer's usage from these factors and other potential economic dynamics continues to be monitored. Over the longer time frame, it is still expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time. 
 Seasonality and the Impact of Weather 
 Revenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. 
 The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. 
 10 

BUSINESS 

 Heating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day. 
 Competition 
 Retail 
 EU I s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. EU I owns and operates facilities necessary to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electricity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. 
 In Ohio, EU I conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. EU I earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity, but not on the cost of the underlying energy. 
 Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites. 
 Wholesale 
 Duke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power, reliability of service and price. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs. 
 Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect EU I s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of EU I to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. 
 Energy Capacity and Resources 
 EU I owns approximately 49,870 MW of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2, Properties. 
 Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause EU I to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. EU I has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply. 
 EU I s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. 
 Sources of Electricity 
 EU I relies principally on natural gas, nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2022. 
 Cost of Delivered Fuel per Net Generation by Source Kilowatt-hour Generated (Cents) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Natural gas and fuel oil (a) 
 34.2 31.8 31.3 6.35 3.89 2.55 Nuclear (a)

 (a) Statistics related to all fuels reflect EU I's public utility ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities. 
 (b) Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped-storage facilities during off-peak periods. 
 Natural Gas and Fuel Oil 
 Natural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for EU I s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future. 
 11 

BUSINESS 

 EU I has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of EU I s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Duke Energy Florida has temporarily agreed to not hedge natural gas prices, but retains an ability to propose hedging again in annual fuel docket filings. 
 EU I has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. EU I may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The EU I natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines. 
 Nuclear 
 The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies. 
 EU I has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. EU I staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, EU I generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts. 
 EU I has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100 of its uranium concentrates through at least 2024, 100 of its conversion services through at least 2026, 100 of its enrichment services through at least 2026, and 100 of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, EU I believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services. 
 Coal 
 EU I meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. EU I uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners, range from 2023 to 2027 for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana, 2023 to 2024 for Duke Energy Progress and 2023 to 2025 for Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Ohio. EU I expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. EU I has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption. As a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet, coal inventories will continue to fluctuate. EU I continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts. 
 Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. There are adequate domestic coal reserves to serve EU I's coal generation needs through end of life. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is between 0.5 and 3.5 for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, and between 0.5 and 4 for Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. EU I's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 emission allowances, enable EU I to satisfy current SO 2 emission limitations for its existing facilities. 
 Purchased Power 
 EU I purchases a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. EU I believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected. 
 The following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years: 
 2022 2021 2020 Purchase obligations and leases (in millions of MWh) (a) 
 41.2 36.0 32.7 Purchase capacity under contract (in MW) (b) 
 4,028 4,259 4,716 
 (a) Represents approximately 16 of total system requirements for 2022, 14 for 2021 and 13 for 2020. 
 (b) For 2022, 2021 and 2020, these agreements include approximately 412 MW of firm capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with QFs. 
 Inventory 
 EU I must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2022, the inventory balance for EU I was approximately 3.4 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

BUSINESS 

 Ash Basin Management 
 During 2015, EPA issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act). 
 EU I has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. Closure activities have begun in all of Duke Energy's jurisdictions. Excavation began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or for reuse in an approved beneficial application. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. 
 The EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, "Other Matters" and Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Commitments and Contingencies" and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively. 
 Nuclear Matters 
 Duke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately 13.7 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. 
 Duke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. 
 The following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.

 (c) Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2018 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019. A new funding study was also completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019. 
 (d) Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2019 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in March 2020. Duke Energy Progress also completed a funding study, which was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in July 2020. In October 2021, Duke Energy Progress filed the 2019 nuclear decommissioning cost study with the FERC, as well as a revised date schedule for decommissioning expense to be collected from wholesale customers. The FERC accepted the filing, as filed on December 9, 2021. 
 (e) During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters, for more information. 
 The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed EU I to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. EU I believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations. 
 13 

BUSINESS 

 The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so EU I will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites. 
 Under federal law, the DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel. 
 Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. With certain modifications and approvals by the NRC to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee and Robinson. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation. During 2020, the NRC and the FPSC approved an agreement to transfer ownership of spent fuel for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters, for more information. 
 The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction. 
 EU I is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. In June 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal application for the Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS) with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew ONS's operating license for an additional 20 years. Duke Energy has announced its intention to seek 20-year operating license renewals for each of the reactors it operates in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters, for additional information. 
 Unit Year of Expiration Duke Energy Carolinas Catawba Units 1 and 2 2043 McGuire Unit 1 2041 McGuire Unit 2 2043 Oconee Units 1 and 2 2033 Oconee Unit 3 2034 Duke Energy Progress Brunswick Unit 1 2036 Brunswick Unit 2 2034 Harris 2046 Robinson 2030 
 The NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on nuclear decommissioning activity, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively. 
 Regulation 
 State 
 The state electric utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state electric utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of EU I s generating facilities. CPCNs issued by the state electric utility commissions, as applicable, authorize EU I to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state electric utility commission is required for the entities within EU I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 
 In addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state electric utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. 
 Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by EU I. EU I uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of EU I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of EU I.

 GAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 GU I conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, TPUC, PHMSA and the FERC. GU I serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers, including customers served by municipalities who are wholesale customers. GU I has over 1.6 million total customers, including 1.1 million customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 550,000 customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville. The following map shows the service territory and investments in operating pipelines for GU I as of December 31, 2022. 
 15 

BUSINESS 

The number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the GU I service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. 
 GU I also has investments in various pipeline transmission projects, renewable natural gas projects and natural gas storage facilities. 
 Natural Gas for Retail Distribution 
 GU I is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. GU I s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows GU I to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, GU I may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or make wholesale secondary market sales. In 2022, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided 100 of the natural gas supply for both Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio. Approximately 90 of forecasted demand was under contract prior to the winter heating season, with firm daily spot purchases making up the balance. 
 16 

BUSINESS 

 Impact of Weather 
 GU I revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium general service customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation. 
 Competition 
 GU I s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. GU I owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. GU I earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices. 
 In residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. GU I's primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs. 
 Higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings. 
 Natural Gas Investments 
 Duke Energy, through its GU I segment, has a 7.5 equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail Phase I mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The remaining lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC was placed into service in March 2018. Phase II of Sabal Trail went into service in May 2020, adding approximately 200,000 Dth of capacity to the Sabal Trail pipeline. 
 Duke Energy, through its GU I segment, has a 47 equity ownership interest in ACP, which planned to build the ACP pipeline, an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP pipeline was intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets and would be regulated by FERC. Dominion Energy owns 53 of ACP and was contracted to construct and operate the ACP pipeline upon completion. On July 5, 2020, Dominion announced a sale of substantially all of its natural gas transmission and storage segment assets, which were critical to the ACP pipeline. Further, permitting delays and legal challenges had materially affected the timing and cost of the pipeline. As a result, Duke Energy determined that they would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline. 
 Duke Energy, also through its GU I segment, has investments in various renewable natural gas joint ventures. 
 GU I has a 21.49 equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45 equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50 equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC. 
 KO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC. KO Transmission sold all of its pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC on February 1, 2023, for approximately book value. 
 See Notes 4, 13 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" and "Variable Interest Entities," respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's and GU I's natural gas investments. 
 Inventory 
 GU I must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2022, the inventory balance for GU I was 185 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

BUSINESS 

 Regulation 
 State 
 The state gas utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state gas utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of GU I s natural gas distribution facilities. CPCNs issued by the state gas utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize GU I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state gas utility commission is required for GU I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 
 In addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent. 
 Natural gas costs are eligible for recovery by GU I. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of GU I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of GU I. 
 The following table summarizes certain components underlying recently approved and effective base rates or rate stabilization filings in the last three years and applications currently pending approval.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Matters Impacting Future Results" for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy. 
 23 

RISK FACTORS 

 BUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS 
 Duke Energy s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals. 
 Duke Energy s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's clean energy transition, which includes achieving net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct, transforming the customer experience, and digital transformation, is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve. 
 Federal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable Duke Energy to reduce its carbon emissions. Supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed including new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage, If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, Duke Energy s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk. 
 Achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained environment. Our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury. Failure to receive approval from the NRC for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050. 
 As a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition. 
 REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS 
 The Duke Energy Registrants regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants earnings could be negatively impacted. Differences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as North Carolina and South Carolina in Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' service territory, may also result in failure to recover costs. 
 If legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and state regulations, laws, commercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of EE measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in Duke Energy service territories or result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies could result in Duke Energy not being able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation. 
 State regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina. State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudently incurred and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings. 
 The rates that the Duke Energy Registrants regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment. 
 The rates that the Duke Energy Registrants regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative decisions made by these regulators, or by any court on appeal of a rate case proceeding, have, and in the future could have, a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position or cash flows and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to recover costs and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made. 
 24 

RISK FACTORS 

 Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses. 
 Increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses. If the retail jurisdictions served by the Duke Energy Registrants become subject to deregulation, the impairment of assets, loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital, and recovery of stranded costs could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of the Duke Energy Registrants whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from QFs from whom the Duke Energy Registrants are legally obligated to purchase energy at an avoided cost rate under PURPA. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including taxes and environmental regulations, that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state regulations and policies, including by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs, causing delays, or prohibiting them outright. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, the Duke Energy Registrants are at risk that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will have such an effect. 
 The EPA has enacted or proposed federal regulations governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater and CO 2 emissions. New state legislation could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the company's plans. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change. 
 There is continued concern, and increasing activism, both nationally and internationally, about climate change. The EPA and state regulators have, and may adopt and implement, additional regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs to address global climate change. Certain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new natural gas infrastructure. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and customers and affect demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact both our electric and natural gas businesses. Regulatory changes could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to meet our net-zero 2050 goal. Though we would plan to seek cost recovery for investments related to GHG emissions reductions through regulatory rate structures, changes in the regulatory climate could result in the delay in or failure to fully recover such costs and investment in generation. 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 The Duke Energy Registrants results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control. 
 Sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence operations. Declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the Duke Energy Registrants regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. 
 25 

RISK FACTORS 

 A continuation of adverse economic conditions including economic downturn or high commodity prices could also negatively impact the financial stability of certain of our customers and result in their inability to pay for electric and natural gas services. This could lead to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves for the Duke Energy Registrants and result in delayed or unrecovered operating costs and lower financial results. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. The Duke Energy Registrants also monitor the impacts of inflation on the procurement of goods and services and seek to minimize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. Rapidly rising prices as a result of inflation or other factors may impact the ability of the company to recover costs timely or execute on its business strategy including the achievement of growth objectives. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could negatively impact the company's ability to accurately forecast the financial impact or reduce the Duke Energy Registrants revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations. 
 Factors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows: 
 weather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner; 
 supply of and demand for energy commodities; 
 transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy operations; 
 availability of purchased power; 
 availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand; 
 natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices; 
 ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, including materials, supplies, and fuel such as coal, natural gas and uranium; and 
 capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants markets. 
 Natural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants operating results. 
 Natural disasters or operational accidents within the company or industry (such as forest fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or natural gas transmission pipeline explosions) could have direct or indirect impacts to the Duke Energy Registrants or to key contractors and suppliers. Further, the generation of electricity and the transportation and storage of natural gas involve inherent operating risks that may result in accidents involving serious injury or loss of life, environmental damage or property damage. Such events could impact the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if a serious operational accident were to occur, existing insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred, including potential litigation awards. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance as a result of such accident, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 The reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations. 
 As a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A CCR-related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 During 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and the EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows. 
 26 

RISK FACTORS 

 The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriately engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers. 
 Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated EE measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as inflation and interest rate volatility, population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. 
 In addition, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have passed legislation implementing the extension of certain tax credits to be used toward the costs of residential solar installation or have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates in response to concerns related to climate change. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of EE in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. 
 Advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. In addition, the electrification of buildings and appliances currently relying on natural gas could reduce the number of customers in our natural gas distribution business. 
 Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 Furthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have EE riders in place to recover the cost of EE programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants future results of operations may be impacted by changing expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns. 
 Duke Energy s ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors, and stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers sustainability goals and energy needs as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, customers, investors and other stakeholders may impact Duke Energy s reputation and affect its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the Duke Energy Registrants. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 As it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. Furthermore, with this heightened emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns, and climate change in particular, there is an increased risk of litigation, activism, and legislation from groups both in support of and opposed to various environmental, social and governance initiatives, which could cause delays and increase the costs of our clean energy transition. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather, including extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns from climate change. 
 Electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal businesses. In most parts of the U.S., the demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Demand for natural gas peaks during the winter months. Further, changing frequency or magnitude of extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, winter storms and severe weather, including from climate change, could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant. 
 Sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, including from climate change, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines, and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. 
 27 

RISK FACTORS 

 The Duke Energy Registrants sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. In addition, the growth of renewables and energy storage will put strains on existing transmission assets and require transmission and distribution upgrades. The FERC s power transmission regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered. 
 The different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants wholesale power marketing business. 
 The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the Duke Energy Registrants' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections or regulations and laws enacted to address climate change, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, offshore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited. 
 Fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants operations as well as their results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions. 
 Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, bankruptcies, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants' ability to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. 
 Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily market-based calculation of financial exposure of the derivative positions. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties could negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity. 
 Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. 
 Cybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication, magnitude and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. Duke Energy relies on the continued operation of sophisticated digital information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the internet continues to increase through grid modernization and other operational excellence initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack from foreign or domestic sources and have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to information and/or information systems or to disrupt utility operations through computer viruses and phishing attempts either directly or indirectly through its material vendors or related third parties. In the event of a significant cybersecurity breach on either the Duke Energy Registrants or with one of our material vendors or related third parties, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, including the disruption of the operation of our natural gas and electric assets and the power grid, theft of confidential company, employee, retiree, shareholder, vendor or customer information, and general business systems and process interruption or compromise, including preventing the Duke Energy Registrants from servicing customers, collecting revenues or the recording, processing and/or reporting financial information correctly, (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, penalties and costs for lack of compliance with relevant regulations, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. While Duke Energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damage experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures. 
 28 

RISK FACTORS 

 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding protection of the physical and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system. The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to regulations set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks required for the operation of nuclear power plants. The Duke Energy Registrants that operate designated critical pipelines that transport natural gas are also subject to security directives issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requiring such registrants to implement specific cybersecurity mitigation measures. While the Duke Energy Registrants believe they are in compliance with, or, in the case of recent TSA security directives, are in the process of implementing such standards and regulations, the Duke Energy Registrants have from time to time been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such standards and regulations. In addition, compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject the Duke Energy Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants operations have been and may be affected by pandemic health events, including COVID-19, in ways listed below and in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to respond to it have resulted in widespread adverse consequences on the global economy and on the Duke Energy Registrants customers, third-party vendors, and other parties with whom we do business. If the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics and outbreaks that may occur are significantly prolonged, it could impact the Duke Energy Registrants' business strategy, results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future as a result of delays in rate cases or other legal proceedings, an inability to obtain labor or equipment necessary for the construction of large capital projects, an inability to procure satisfactory levels of fuels or other necessary equipment for the continued production of electricity and delivery of natural gas, and the health and availability of our critical personnel and their ability to perform business functions. 
 Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 The rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. 
 As members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. 
 Duke Energy s long-term strategy requires the construction of new projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a number of risks, including construction delays, delays in or failure to receive required regulatory approvals and/or sitting or environmental permits, nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs. 
 The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyberattacks, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that the Duke Energy Registrants and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that the Duke Energy Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the affected Duke Energy Registrant. 
 Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders. 
 While we strive to maintain constructive communications with our shareholders, activist shareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our Board and management. Perceived uncertainties as to the future direction or governance of the company may cause concern to our current or potential regulators, vendors or strategic partners, or make it more difficult to execute on our strategy or to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may have a material impact on our business and operating results. 
 In addition, actions such as those described above could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock, based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.

RISK FACTORS 

 NUCLEAR GENERATION RISKS 
 Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities. 
 Ownership interests in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. 
 Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMMON STOCK RISKS 
 The Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants control. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit the Duke Energy Registrants ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth. 
 Market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, unfavorable capital market conditions, market prices for natural gas and coal, geopolitical risks, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. Additionally, rapidly rising interest rates could impact the ability to affordably finance the capital plan or increase rates to customers and could have an impact on our ability to execute on our clean energy transition. The availability of credit under Duke Energy s Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systemic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement. 
 Duke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity. 
 Each of the Duke Energy Registrants senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future. 
 If the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. 
 A downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 Non-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants ability to execute future borrowings. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. 
 30 

RISK FACTORS 

 Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding. 
 Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected. 
 Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants liquidity and results of operations. 
 The costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 Duke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. 
 Because Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy s common stock. 
 GENERAL RISKS 
 The failure of Duke Energy information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants businesses. 
 Duke Energy s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 In addition to maintaining our current information technology systems, Duke Energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy s information technology systems are critical to cost-effective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 Potential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants businesses. 
 The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transportation systems for our fuel sources including natural gas pipelines, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC s design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. 
 31 

RISK FACTORS 

 Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations. 
 Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.

 Clean Energy Transition . Our industry continues to experience an unprecedented level of change and 2022 was a dynamic year for our company as we navigated macroeconomic headwinds and continued to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver on our vision. 
 Generating Cleaner Energy 
 We re targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5 by 2030 and a full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals. We ve made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity genera tion (a 44 reduction from 2005) and h ave committed to do more (at least 50 reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050). In October 2022, we announced an additional interim target to reduce carbon emissions from electric generation by 80 by 2040. We also adopted a goal of reducing Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, by 50 by 2035, on the way to net-zero by 2050. 
 Duke Energy is one of the first utilities to address the totality of its impact approximately 95 of the company's greenhouse gas emissions are now tied to a measurable net-zero goal. Over the next decade, we expect to deploy over 145 billion of capital into our regulated businesses, driven by clean energy transition investments. These investments will drive substantial economic benefits for the communities we serve and reduce our customer s exposure to fuel volatility. We ve filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions, allowing us to accelerate coal plant retirements, make needed grid investments to enable renewables and energy storage, and increase resiliency. To partially fund this plan, in December 2022, we closed on the second and final tranche of the approximate 2 billion investment in Duke Energy Indiana by GIC. 
 In 2022, we were awarded one of two North Carolina offshore wind sites held by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The approximately 55,000-acre site in the Atlantic Ocean east of Wilmington could support up to 1.6 gigawatts of potential offshore wind energy, enough to power nearly 375,000 homes. Securing this contract creates optionality for future offshore wind if the NCUC determines it's part of the least cost path to achieve North Carolina's interim and long-term carbon reduction goals. 
 As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will actively work to advocate for research and development and deployment of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. This includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels. 
 Sale of Commercial Renewables 
 In November 2022, the Board approved pursuing the sale of our Commercial Renewables business, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay. Since 2007, we have built a portfolio of approximately 5,000 megawatts of commercial wind, solar and battery projects across the U.S., and established a robust development pipeline. As we look forward to the remainder of this decade and beyond, we have line of sight to significant renewable, grid and other investment opportunities within our faster-growing regulated operations. 
 Carbon Plan 
 North Carolina House Bill 951 (HB 951) was passed in 2021 and reflects new state policy that accelerates a clean energy transition for generation serving customers in the Carolinas, including providing a framework for a goal of 70 carbon reduction in electric generation in the state from 2005 levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for our customers. The legislation established a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO 2 emission reductions through the use of least cost planning, including stakeholder involvement, and also introduced modernized recovery mechanisms, including multiyear rate plans (MYRP), that promote more efficient recovery of investments and performance-based regulation (PBR), that align incentives between the company and the state s energy policy objectives. 
 In May 2022, we filed a proposed Carbon Plan with the NCUC that outlined potential pathways toward achieving the HB 951 carbon reduction targets while balancing affordability and reliability for our customers. We presented four portfolios a base portfolio of what it would take to achieve 70 carbon reduction by 2030 and other portfolios demonstrating the impact of an extension to the 2030 compliance deadline to allow the introduction of new technologies at a more affordable price. In December 2022, the NCUC issued an order adopting its initial Carbon Plan, which included a set of near-term actions to support meeting the state's carbon reduction goals. This is a constructive outcome that advances our clean energy transition, supporting a diverse, all-of-the-above approach that is essential for long-term resource planning. 
 Modernizing the Power Grid and Natural Gas Infrastructure 
 Our grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to continue to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2022, smart, self-healing technologies helped to avoid more than 1.4 million customer interruptions across our six-state electric service area, saving customers more than 443 million minutes of lost outage time.

MD A DUKE ENERGY 

 Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity in the business and we continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape. In 2022, we filed for approval of a new demand response pilot program expected to launch in 2023 for customers in the Duke Energy Carolinas service area. Pilot incentives will reduce vehicle lease payments for program participants who lease an eligible electric vehicle, including Ford F-150 Lightning trucks. In exchange, customers will allow their electric vehicles to feed energy back to the grid helping to balance it during peak demand. Also, in August 2022, Duke Energy Florida announced a research and development pilot program to test and evaluate the viability of the new Ford F-150 Lightning all-electric truck's high-capacity batteries as a grid edge resource. 
 Recognizing the importance of natural gas to our plans, we continue to work toward a net-zero methane emission goal by 2030 related to our natural gas distribution business. In our LDC business, we are making great progress reducing methane emissions through our partnership with Accenture, Microsoft and Avanade to use satellites and build an emissions platform, the addition of other sensors and technologies to find and fix leaks in near real time, and the use of cross compression to avoid releasing natural gas into the atmosphere during certain operational activities. Investments in integrity management of our natural gas infrastructure continue to be of importance to ensure reliable, safe, and increasingly clean delivery of natural gas to our customers. 
 Response to Macroeconomic Headwinds . In addition to achieving financial results in the upper half of our revised guidance, we continued our cost-management journey with a focus on driving productivity, increasing flexibility and prioritizing spend based on risk and strategic value to our customers and investors. In 2022, to address rising interest rates, increased commodity prices, labor and material inflation, and supply chain constraints, we launched the Workload Reduction Initiative, building on our culture of continuous improvement to identify more ways to reduce operating costs. Including cost reductions from supply chain, we identified approximately 300 million of savings opportunities focused on organization simplification, elimination of work, automation, reducing service levels provided to internal customers, and outsourcing. 
 Commodity prices have impacted the price of electricity in all of our jurisdictions. We actively worked to manage and maintain prices at lower levels than they otherwise would be in light of increased commodity prices, working with our regulators to extend recovery periods in certain jurisdictions in a way that is manageable for our customers. We also continued our work with our vulnerable customers through increased communications, securing state and federal funding, and providing access to philanthropic support. Additionally, we've created a specialized team that's partnered with agencies across our service territories and has helped connect customers to nearly 300 million in energy assistance funding since 2021. 
 We successfully navigated supply chain challenges including inflation, longer lead times, and shortages of solar panels and other equipment. We've executed longer supply agreements and proactively secured equipment in early 2022 for hurricane season while placing orders for key needs for our customer delivery organization for 2023. Our procurement teams continue to execute on action plans to enhance planning, augment supply, amend operations and leverage our scale to continue to mitigate these risks to the extent possible. 
 Constructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes . One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. Grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth and we have a MYRP in Florida through 2024. Additionally, as highlighted above, HB 951 provides the framework for many of the benefits of modernized regulatory constructs in North Carolina under the direction of the NCUC. Duke Energy Progress filed its first rate case utilizing these benefits, including both PBR and MYRP, in North Carolina in October 2022. In January 2023, we also filed a Duke Energy Carolinas rate case in North Carolina, which incorporates elements of PBR and MYRP. 
 In addition to the Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas rate cases in North Carolina, we continued to move a variety of other regulatory initiatives forward during 2022. Base rate cases were filed for both Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont in South Carolina, for Duke Energy Ohio's natural gas business, and for Duke Energy Kentucky's electric business. Constructive partial settlements were approved by the NCUC in January 2022 related to Piedmont's 2021 North Carolina rate case and by the PUCO in December 2022 related to Duke Energy Ohio's 2021 electric rate case. We also reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with all parties in the Duke Energy Progress South Carolina rate case in January 2023, which the PSCSC approved in February 2023. Duke Energy Indiana's TDSIC 2.0 was approved in June 2022 and Duke Energy Florida's 10 year storm protection plan was approved in October 2022, both of which provide for significant investments to improve the reliability and integrity of the grid in their respective jurisdictions. Overall, this was a very active year as it relates to regulatory filings, which reflects the important investments and ongoing clean energy transition across all our service territories. 
 In November 2022, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) announced it had initiated operations. The new SEEM platform facilitates sub-hourly, bilateral trading, allowing participants to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission and providing southeastern electricity customers cost, reliability and environmental benefits. Also in 2022, storm securitization legislation was passed in South Carolina, providing the opportunity to securitize deferred storm costs and lower the bill impacts for our customers. W e also continue to evaluate the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to have significant benefits to customers and lower the cost of the clean energy transition. 
 Customer Satisfaction . Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are most important to the customer experience. In 2022, we successfully implemented the last of eight jurisdictional releases of Customer Connect, a new system that consolidates four legacy billing systems into one customer-service platform, allowing us to deliver the universal experience customers expect. While customer satisfaction across our industry continues to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment and the impacts of higher fuel prices on customer bills, our work continues to be recognized by our customers, with incremental improvements in customer satisfaction scores at certain jurisdictions including Piedmont, which was ranked number one in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for residential natural gas service in the south.

 Operational Excellence, Safety and Reliability . The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities continues to be foundational to serving our customers, our financial results, and our credibility with stakeholders. This year presented unique challenges to the grid in our service territories, including attacks on two substations in Moore County, North Carolina and extreme winter weather that forced us to take unprecedented measures to ensure the integrity of our systems in North Carolina. Despite these recent challenges, our regulated generation fleet and nuclear sites had strong performance throughout the year and our electric distribution system performed well. The safety of our workforce is a core value. While our TICR was slightly above target, our employees continued to deliver strong safety results in 2022 and we remain an industry leader in personal safety. In addition, we continued our strong environmental performance, with no reportable environmental events. 
 Storm activity was severe in our service territories in 2022. Hurricane Ian, the fifth-strongest hurricane on record, impacted our service territories in Florida and the Carolinas with heavy rainfall, strong winds, and life-threatening storm surge and flooding. Across our service territories, we assembled more than 20,000 power line technicians, damage assessors, and vegetation workers to prepare and begin to restore power as soon as it was safe to do so. In total, we experienced 2 million outages, and thanks to their efforts, more than 97 of our Florida customers were restored within three days of the storm moving out of our Florida territories, and over 99 of our Carolinas customers within two days of the storm exiting the Carolinas. In November, Hurricane Nicole made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane causing nearly 300,000 customer outages. Our crews were able to restore more than 98 of those outages within 12 hours. 
 In December, high winds and extreme cold from Winter Storm Elliott, customer demand that was higher than forecasted, and inability to import additional power from out of state, resulted in the need to temporarily interrupt service to about 500,000 customers to maintain overall grid reliability and prevent further potential disruptions in the Carolinas. We will continue to further evaluate lessons learned to improve our strategy and communications, and incorporate any identified improvements to address this matter to better serve our customers now and in the future. 
 Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2022 storm response efforts, including navigating ongoing macroeconomic challenges and supply chain constraints, is a testament to our team s extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Duke Energy has received over 20 Emergency Response Awards since EEI began recognizing storm response in 1998 (including nine for assisting other utilities). We received EEI s Emergency Assistance Award for our support to other electric companies following Hurricane Ian, as well as EEI s Emergency Recovery Award for multiple events that include our own recovery from Hurricane Ian, Winter Storm Izzy, and the July storms in the Midwest. 
 Duke Energy Objectives 2023 and Beyond 
 At Duke Energy, our climate strategy is our business strategy to safely transform and ready our system by investing in new and existing carbon-free technology, modernizing our gas and electric infrastructure, and expanding and integrating efficiency and demand management programs. As we transition our business to cleaner sources of energy, we are focused on delivering sustainable value for our customers and shareholders by maintaining affordability and leveraging business transformation to exceed customer expectations, optimizing investments to drive attractive shareholder returns, and providing new product offerings and solutions that deliver growth and customer value. To achieve these major milestones, we are shaping the landscape by partnering with stakeholders, championing public policy that advances innovation, and advancing regulatory models that support carbon and methane emission reductions. 
 
 Matters Impacting Future Results 
 The matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Coal Ash Costs 
 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress both have approxi mately 1.4 billion, in regulatory assets related to coal ash retirement obligations as of December 31, 2022. Future spending, including amounts recorded for depreciation and liability accretion, is expected to continue to be deferred and recovered in future rate cases or rider filings. The majority of spend is expected to occur over the next 10 to 15 years. 
 Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the CCR rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to further legal challenges and regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. In January 2022, Duke Energy Indiana received a letter from the EPA regarding interpretation of the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana has approximately 385 million in regulatory assets related to coal ash asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2022. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies" for more information. 
 Fuel Cost Recovery 
 As a result of rapidly rising commodity costs, including natural gas, fuel and purchased power prices in excess of amounts included in fuel-related revenues has led to an increase in the undercollection of fuel costs from customers at certain jurisdictions including Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. These amounts have been deferred in regulatory assets and have impacted the cash flows of the registrants, including increased borrowings to temporarily finance related expenditures until recovery. The Duke Energy Registrants are working with various state commissions on the timing of recovery of these amounts. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" for more information.

 Commercial Renewables 
 In November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups. The bid process for the utility-scale solar and wind group is ongoing. Initial indicative bids were received for the distributed generation group in January 2023. Duke Energy expects to dispose of both groups in the second half of 2023. The Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups were classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Duke Energy recorded an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2022. If necessary, the loss on the sale of the assets will be updated based on market changes or the final sales price, after any adjustments at closing for working capital and capital expenditures and could be materially different than the estimated loss. Additionally, certain other costs resulting from the transactions may be recognized in the period incurred, including Duke Energy's share of debt extinguishment costs and costs incurred to modify or terminate PPAs. Proceeds from the sales are expected to be used for debt avoidance. For more information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Dispositions." 
 In February 2021, a severe winter storm impacted certain Commercial Renewables assets in Texas. Extreme weather conditions limited the ability for these solar and wind facilities to generate and sell electricity into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. Duke Energy has been named in multiple lawsuits arising out of this winter storm. The legal actions related to these lawsuits will remain with Duke Energy and any future activity related to the matters will be presented in discontinued operations. For more information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies." 
 Supply Chain 
 Duke Energy is monitoring supply chain disruptions, which could impact the timing of in-service dates and may result in adverse impacts on operating results. The company is also monitoring the potential impacts on future financial results and clean energy goals due to supply chain challenges regarding the availability of transformers and renewable components like solar panels and batteries. 
 Other 
 Duke Energy is monitoring general market conditions, including rising interest rates, and evaluating the impact to its results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy s performance across periods. 
 Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively. 
 Special items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs: 
 Regulatory matters and litigation represents the net impact of charges related to the Indiana court rulings on coal ash and other unrelated ongoing litigation. 
 Workplace and workforce realignment represents costs attributable to business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes and workforce reduction. 
 Regulatory settlements represents an impairment charge related to the South Carolina Supreme Court decision on coal ash, insurance proceeds and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress coal ash settlement. 
 Gas pipeline investments represents additional exit obligations related to ACP. 
 Discontinued operations primarily includes results from Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups, including an estimated impairment on the sale of the business in 2022. 
 Duke Energy s adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.

 (b) Net of tax benefit of 31 million and tax benefit of 44 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 72 million recorded within Impairment of assets and other charges, 71 million recorded within Operations, maintenance and other and a 7 million gain recorded in Gains on sales of other assets and other for the year ended December 31, 2022. 133 million recorded within Impairment of assets and other charges, 42 million within Operations, maintenance and other, and 17 million within Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 (c) Net of tax benefit of 21 million. 202 million of expense recorded within Impairment of assets and other charges, 111 million of income within Other income and expenses, 12 million of expense within Operations, maintenance and other, 28 million of income within Regulated electric operating revenues, 8 million of expense within Interest expense and 7 million of expense within Depreciation and amortization. 
 (d) Net of tax benefit of 5 million. 20 million loss recorded within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates. 
 (e) Recorded in Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, and Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2021 
 GAAP Reported EPS was 3.17 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.94 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in GAAP Reported Earnings/EPS was primarily due to the estimated impairment on the sale of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups in the current year. 
 As discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy s adjusted EPS was 5.27 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.99 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Adjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS was primarily due to higher volumes, favorable weather and rate case contributions, partially offset by higher financing costs, higher depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base, storm costs and unfavorable market impacts. 
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS 
 The remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Duke Energy's segment structure includes Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU I). The remainder of Duke Energy s operations is presented as Other.

 Interest Expense . The variance was primarily due to higher interest rates and outstanding debt balances and lower CEP Rider deferrals. 
 Income Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes related to the Ohio MGP Settlement, partially offset by an increase in pretax income. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were 1.7 and 12.2 , respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes related to the Ohio MGP Settlement.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2021 
 The higher net loss was driven by higher interest expense and lower return on investments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from the NMC investment and prior year obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation. 
 Operating Expenses. The decrease was primarily driven by prior year obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation, lower expense on certain employee benefit obligations and lower asset impairments to optimize the company's real estate portfolio and reduce office space. 
 Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to lower return on investments that fund certain employee benefit obligations, partially offset by higher equity earnings from the NMC investment. 
 Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher interest rates and outstanding debt balances. 
 Income Tax Benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily due to a reduction of a valuation allowance relating to a capital loss carryforward in the prior year, partially offset by lower state tax benefit in the prior year. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, were 27.9 and 34.5 , respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to a reduction of a valuation allowance relating to a capital loss carryforward in the prior year.

MD A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations. 
 Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. 
 For further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 
 Regulated Operations Accounting 
 Substantially all of Duke Energy s regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred. 
 Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as: 
 applicable regulatory environment changes; 
 historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy s jurisdictions; 
 litigation of rate orders; 
 recent rate orders to other regulated entities; 
 levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and 
 the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. 
 If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. 
 As required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability. 
 For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessments 
 Duke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2022. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2022, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. 
 Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy s internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2022 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2022, for each of Duke Energy s reporting units ranged from 6.6 to 6.9 . The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges. 
 One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31. The implied market multiples used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2022, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 10.3 to 13.6.

MD A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

 Duke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates or implied market multiples over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity. 
 Duke Energy has 19.3 billion in Goodwill at both December 31, 2022, and 2021. For further information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." 
 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 AROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Duke Energy has 12.7 billion and 12.6 billion of AROs as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. See Note 10, "Asset Retirement Obligations," for further details including a rollforward of related liabilities. 
 The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, regulatory, legal, and legislative decisions, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. 
 Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2020, Duke Energy Florida, closed an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station after receiving approval from the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility. 
 Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. In prior years, certain ash basins have had probability weightings applied to them based on different potential closure methods and the probabilities surrounding pending legal changes. 
 For further information, see Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Commitments and Contingencies" and "Asset Retirement Obligations." 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Duke Energy calculated an estimated impairment on the disposition of its Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups as of December 31, 2022. The impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying amount to fair value, less cost to sell. The fair value was primarily determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows, but also considered market information obtained through the bidding process. Estimated future cash flows under the income approach were based on Duke Energy's forecast, which was informed by existing power purchase agreements with offtakers and forward merchant curves. Significant assumptions used in the income approach include forward merchant curves and discount rates. The discount rates take into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. 
 The actual loss will be recorded based on final sales agreements and could be materially different than the estimated loss. 
 For further information, See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Dispositions." 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IRA, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030.

 (a) Includes nuclear fuel of approximately 1.9 billion in 2023-2025. 
 
 Debt 
 Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Duke Energy Registrants. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities, for information regarding the Duke Energy Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Fuel and purchased power includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as NPNS. Duke Energy s contractual cash obligations for fuel and purchased power as of December 31, 2022, are as follows: 
 Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 year (2023) 2-3 years (2024 2025) 4-5 years (2026 2027) More than 5 years (2028 beyond) Fuel and purchased power 23,255 5,840 7,277 3,674 6,464 
 Other Purchase Obligations 
 Other purchase obligations includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services, contractual obligations for Engineering, Procurement, and Construction agreement costs for new generation plants, solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amou nt excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. Total cash commitments for related other purchase obligation expenditures are 12,095 million, with 11,118 million expected to be paid in the next 12 months. 
 See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Leases for a schedule of both finance lease and operating lease payments over the next five years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations for information on nuclear decommissioning trust funding obligations and the closure of ash impoundments. 
 Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased nonperformance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications, for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed in Note 8 and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Variable Interest Entities." 
 
 Cash and Liquidity 
 The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities, for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement. 
 57 

MD A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Duke Energy had approximately 409 million of cash on hand, 5.2 billion available under its 9 billion Master Credit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. Refer to Notes 7 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities" and "Stockholders' Equity," respectively, for information regarding Duke Energy's debt and equity issuances, debt maturities and available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility. 
 Credit Facilities and Registration Statements 
 See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 
 Dividend Payments 
 In 2022, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 96th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
 Duke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of bet ween 65 and 75 , bas ed upon adjusted EPS. Duke Energy increased the dividend by approxima tely 2 annu ally in both 2022 and 2021, and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend. 
 Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries 
 As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, Duke Energy s public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2022, the amount of restricted net assets of subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy s net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations. 
 
 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operations of EU I and GU I are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy s operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations. 
 As part of Duke Energy s continued effort to improve its cash flows from operations and liquidity, Duke Energy works with vendors to improve terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. To support this effort, Duke Energy established a supply chain finance program (the program in 2020, under which suppliers, at their sole discretion, may sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the participating financial institution. The financial institution administers the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program. Suppliers decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of Duke Energy, economic downturn or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions willingness to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not believe such risk would have a material impact on our cash flows from operations or liquidity, as substantially all our payments are made outside the program. 
 Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information). 
 
 Debt Issuances 
 Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt. 
 In 2023, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional securities of 6.7 billion through debt capital markets. I n certain instances Duke Energy may utilize instruments other than senior notes, including equity-content securities such as subordinated debt or preferred stock. Proceeds will primarily be for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding significant debt issuances.

 Duke Energy s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. 
 Projected 2023 Actual 2022 Actual 2021 Equity 41 41 43 Debt 59 59 57 
 Restrictive Debt Covenants 
 Duke Energy s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70 for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2022, Duke Energy presented approximatel y 131 million of long-term debt as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of a technical default due to the bankruptcy filing of a Duke Energy customer. The Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all other covenants related to their debt agreements as of December 31, 2022. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and S P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants. The following table includes Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries credit ratings and ratings outlook as of February 2023. 
 Moody's S P Duke Energy Corporation Stable Stable Issuer Credit Rating Baa2 BBB+ Senior Unsecured Debt Baa2 BBB Junior Subordinated Debt/Preferred Stock Baa3 BBB- Commercial Paper P-2 A-2 Duke Energy Carolinas Stable Stable Senior Secured Debt Aa3 A Senior Unsecured Debt A2 BBB+ Progress Energy Stable Stable Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB Duke Energy Progress Stable Stable Senior Secured Debt Aa3 A Duke Energy Florida Stable Stable Senior Secured Debt A1 A Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB+ Duke Energy Ohio Stable Stable Senior Secured Debt A2 A Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB+ Duke Energy Indiana Stable Stable Senior Secured Debt Aa3 A Senior Unsecured Debt A2 BBB+ Duke Energy Kentucky Stable Stable Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB+ Piedmont Natural Gas Stable Stable Senior Unsecured A3 BBB+ 
 Credit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Risk Management Policies 
 The Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework. 
 Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits. 
 The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. 
 Duke Energy s exposure to these fluctuations through its regulated utility operations is limited since these operations are subject to cost-based regulation and are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. 
 Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging. 
 Generation Portfolio Risks 
 For the EU I segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is limited due to mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of most of the net profits from these activities with retail customers. 
 Hedging Strategies 
 Duke Energy monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas hedging contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. 
 61 

MD A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 Duke Energy also manages its exposure to basis risk through the use of congestion hedge products in RTOs such as financial transmission rights (PJM and MISO), which result in payments based on differentials in locational marginal prices. The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Debt and Credit Facilities, Derivatives and Hedging, and Fair Value Measurements. 
 Duke Energy h ad 9.2 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2022. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately 92 million at December 31, 2022. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2022. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as a result of its issuances of long-term debt denominated in a foreign currency. Duke Energy manages foreign currency exchange risk exposure by entering into cross-currency swaps, a type of financial derivative instrument, which mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure. See Notes 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities, Derivatives and Hedging and Fair Value Measurements," respectively. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits. 
 To reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging, for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants credit risk. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk. 
 Credit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.

MD A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment to assist customers during the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants experienced higher charge-offs during 2022, and higher utility account balances in arrears as of December 31, 2022. There is an expectation for the increase in charge-offs to continue in the near term. The Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 4 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Revenue," respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers. 
 Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications, for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 Duke Energy is subject to credit risk from transactions with counterparties to cross-currency swaps related to future interest and principal payments. The credit exposure to such counterparties may take the form of higher costs to meet Duke Energy's future euro-denominated interest and principal payments in the event of counterparty default. Duke Energy selects highly rated banks as counterparties and allocates the hedge for each debt issuance across multiple counterparties. The master agreements with the counterparties impose collateral requirements on the parties in certain circumstances indicative of material deterioration in a party's creditworthiness. 
 Based on the Duke Energy Registrants policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty. 
 Marketable Securities Price Risk 
 As described further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
 Pension Plan Assets 
 Duke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets. 
 A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy s results of operations in those periods. 
 Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds 
 As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2022, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. 
 Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the funds will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations, for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, for additional information regarding NDTF assets.

 OTHER MATTERS 
 Environmental Regulations 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 The following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 Coal Combustion Residuals 
 In April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. 
 In addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively. 
 Coal Ash Act 
 AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. 
 Consistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective action plans to NCDEQ. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans for six sites in North Carolina and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans for all 14 North Carolina sites to NCDEQ. In addition, from 2020 through 2022, Duke Energy submitted updated comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective action plans for the remaining North Carolina sites, except for Buck Steam Station, which Duke Energy expects to submit in June 2023. 
 On April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations. 
 Following NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately 4 billion to 5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to 9.5 billion to 10.5 billion. The settlement lowered the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately 1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy s original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina was estimated to be approximately 8 billion to 9 billion, of which approximat ely 3.5 billion has been spent through 2022. The majority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 10 to 15 years. 
 Duke Energy has completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend, Dan River, Asheville and Sutton plants. 
 For further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and Asset Retirement Obligations, respectively.

 North Carolina House Bill 951 
 On October 13, 2021, North Carolina House Bill 951 (HB 951) was signed into law (the Legislation ). This Legislation establishes a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO 2 emission reductions from electric generating facilities in the state through the use of least cost planning while providing for continued reliability and affordable rates for customers served by such generation. It also authorizes the use of performance-based regulation in North Carolina. Among other things, the Legislation requires the NCUC to: 
 develop an initial carbon plan that would target a 70 reduction in CO 2 emissions from public utilities' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology; 
 adopt rules to implement the requirements of the Legislation authorizing PBR that includes MYRP with a maximum three-year term, performance incentive mechanisms to track utility performance, and revenue decoupling for the residential customer class; 
 establish rules to securitize costs associated with the early retirement of subcritical coal-fired electric generating facilities necessary to achieve the authorized carbon reduction goals at 50 of remaining net book value, with the remaining net book value recovered through normal cost-of-service basis; and 
 initiate a process for updating rates and terms of certain existing solar power purchase agreements executed under PURPA. 
 In October 2022 and January 2023, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, respectively, filed applications with the NCUC, which proposed implementation of the Legislation s provisions around PBR, including MYRP, residential decoupling and performance incentive mechanisms. Additionally, on December 30, 2022, the NCUC issued an order adopting the first Carbon Plan as directed by the Legislation. 
 See Note 4, "Regulatory Matters" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 Other Environmental Regulations 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
 Global Climate Change and Regulation of GHG Emissions 
 In 2021, President Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and announced a new target for the United States of 50 to 52 reduction in economywide net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. submittal to support this Paris target includes a goal for 100 carbon-free electricity by 2035. These actions have been supplemented by a number of executive orders by President Biden and an indication by a number of regulatory agencies, including the EPA, that they would impose additional regulations on CO 2 and methane emissions to which Duke Energy will be subject. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring these matters and cannot predict the outcome, however, there could be a material impact on our clean energy transition. 
 CO 2 Emissions Reductions 
 The Duke Energy Registrants direct GHG emissions consist primarily of CO 2 that results primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to serve its customers reliably and affordably. In 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with new goals of at least 50 reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels from electric generation by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. In February 2022, we added Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, to our 2050 net-zero goal. In October 2022, we announced an additional interim target to reduce carbon emissions from electric generation by 80 from 2005 levels by 2040. Duke Energy also adopted an interim goal of reducing Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions mentioned above by 50 below 2021 levels by 2035. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO 2 emissions over time. Between 2005 and 2022, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO 2 emissions from their electricity generation by 44 . T imelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of GHG emissions will vary in each state in which the company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. The goals announced in 2019, and updated in 2022, as well as the actions taken to reduce CO 2 emissions, potentially lower the exposure to any future mandatory CO 2 emission reduction requirements, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. 
 Actions to reduce CO 2 emissions have included the retirement of 56 coal-fired electric generating units with a combined generating capacity of 7,500 MW, while investing in renewables and state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated than coal. Duke Energy also has made investments to increase EE offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-CO 2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO 2 emissions. 
 Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO 2 emissions, including EE, wind, solar and storage, as well as evolving technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, long-duration storage and advanced nuclear, in its efforts to achieve its net-zero goal as well as to comply with any future regulations. Duke Energy plans to adjust to and incorporate evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability while meeting regulatory requirements and customer demands. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO 2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. Future levels of GHG emissions by the Duke Energy Registrants will be influenced by variables that include capacity needs in the jurisdictions in which they operate, public policy, tax incentives, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, fuel prices, market prices, availability of resources and labor, compliance with new or existing regulations, the ability to make enhancements to transmission and distribution systems to support increased renewables, and the existence of new technologies that can be deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet customer demand.

MD A OTHER MATTERS 

 Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants do not purchase carbon credits or offsets for use in connection with the company's net-zero emissions goals. Though they may purchase carbon credits or offsets for such uses in the future, the amount or cost of which is not expected to be material at this time. 
 Generation Mix Planning Process 
 The Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company s thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term generation resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction. 
 For a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO 2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO 2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO 2 emissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO 2 price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO 2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes. 
 In September 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their IRPs in North Carolina and South Carolina, and, in December 2021, Duke Energy Indiana filed its IRP, outlining an accelerated energy transition, which aligns with the company's 2030 CO 2 emissions goal. In December 2021, the PSCSC rejected Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress preferred accelerated coal retirements IRP scenario and instead found that the base case without a price on CO 2 emissions was the most reasonable IRP scenario. 
 In 2021, the state of North Carolina passed HB 951, which among other things, directs the NCUC to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan by the end of 2022 that would target a 70 reduction in CO 2 emissions from Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Carolinas' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology. In light of this legislation, in November 2021, the NCUC declined to make a determination on the portfolios presented in the 2020 IRP noting that the legislation may impact the schedule for coal plant retirements and new resources and limited its order to short-term actions for use on an interim basis pending preparation of the carbon plan. The NCUC approved its initial carbon reduction plan in December 2022, which considered feedback from extensive stakeholder engagement and was informed by Duke Energy's initial proposed carbon plan, filed with the NCUC on May 16, 2022, and built on the IRPs that were filed in 2020 by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. 
 CO 2 and Methane Emissions Reductions from the Natural Gas Distribution Business 
 In addition to CO 2 emissions resulting primarily from our operations of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants are also responsible for certain methane emissions from the distribution of natural gas to customers. In October 2020, Duke Energy announced a new goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution business by 2030. The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in methane emission reductions, including the replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipelines and associated services with plastic or coated steel, advanced methane leak detection efforts, reducing time to repair nonhazardous leaks and operational releases of methane, and investment in renewable natural gas. 
 Timelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of upstream methane emissions will vary in each state in which the company s natural gas distribution business operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. EPA has also proposed regulations that would require reduction of methane emissions upstream of the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution business. The impact of these regulations on natural gas fuel prices is not currently quantifiable. 
 In addition to possible EPA regulation of methane emissions, certain local governments, none within the jurisdictions in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate, have enacted or are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in new buildings and focus on electrification. Enactment of similar regulations in the areas in which the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution operates could have a significant impact on the natural gas distribution business and its operations. At this time, such impacts are not able to be quantified; however, the net-zero methane goals announced in 2020 for the natural gas distribution business, as well as the actions taken to reduce these GHG emissions, potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs with any new regulations through the regulatory process. 
 Physical Impacts of Climate Change 
 The Duke Energy Registrants recognize that scientists associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere. It is possible that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating with any certainty any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants operations difficult. Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to continue to seek recovery of storm costs through the appropriate regulatory mechanisms. For more information on storm securitization in North Carolina and storm cost recovery in Florida, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 
 The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric transmission and distribution systems and natural gas facilities. The steps include modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing systems and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants electric generating facilities and natural gas facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain inventories of coal, oil and liquified natural gas to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity and/or natural gas.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Dispositions Assessment of Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations Classification and Impairment Charge Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements. 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 In November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay Commercial Renewables business segment ). As a result, the Commercial Renewables business segment was classified as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations and pretax impairment charges of approximately 1.7 billion were recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value, based on the expected selling price less cost to sell. 
 We identified the assessment of held for sale and discontinued operations classification and associated impairment charges as a critical audit matter because of the extensive effort required to audit the subjective and complex judgments associated with those matters, including: 
 The assessment of whether the sale is probable and the transfer of assets will be completed within one year from period-end; 
 The assessment of whether the sale of the segment represents a discontinued operation; 
 The determination of the impairment charges; and 
 The assessment of the fair value of the Commercial Renewables business segment. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the classification of the Commercial Renewables business segment as held for sale and the associated impairment charges included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over (1) the evaluation and disclosure of the held for sale and discontinued operations classification and (2) the determination of the impairment charges, including controls over the reasonableness of the inputs and assumptions used in management s estimates. 
 We evaluated management s assessment of held for sale and discontinued operations classification as follows: 
 Inquired of executive officers, key members of management and members of the Board of Directors to obtain an understanding of plans to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment. 
 70 

REPORTS 

 Assessed management s judgments in determining whether the Commercial Renewables business segment meets the held for sale and discontinued operations classification criteria through procedures performed, including, but not limited to, reviewing minutes from meetings of the Board of Directors, reviewing communications regarding the progression of the selling process, and assessing the Commercial Renewables business segment relative to the Company s operations and financial results. 
 Compared management s conclusions against relevant guidance and tested the completeness and accuracy of information used in the Company s evaluation. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets by using an internal fair value specialist to assess the reasonableness of the overall methodology and discount rates. Additionally, we evaluated the mathematical accuracy of the underlying calculations. Further, we tested forecasted information used to determine fair value. 
 We evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the Company's reclassification of balances and activity and related disclosures. 
 We obtained representation from management asserting to the appropriate presentation, measurement and timing of the Commercial Renewables business segment. 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 10 to the financial statements . 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies (the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company s electric and natural gas distribution companies. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As discussed in Note 4, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of storm costs, fuel costs, and asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 18.1 billion of recorded regulatory assets. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions; to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets. 
 How the Critical Audit Matters Were Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We also evaluated the external information and compared it to management s recorded balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s and intervenors filings with the Commissions, that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following: 
 We inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable. 
 We utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances. 
 We compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance.

REPORTS 

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 10 to the financial statements. 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the North Carolina Utilities Commission and by the South Carolina Public Service Commission (collectively the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As discussed in Note 4, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of storm costs, fuel costs, and asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 5.4 billion recorded as regulatory assets. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management s recorded balances for completeness. 
 78 

REPORTS 

 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s and intervenors filings with the Commission, that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions . 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following: 
 We inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable. 
 We utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances. 
 We compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance. 
 We obtained an analysis from management and letters from internal legal counsel for asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash costs, regarding probability of recovery for deferred costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery. 
 We obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 10 to the financial statements. 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the North Carolina Utilities Commission and by the South Carolina Public Service Commission (collectively the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As discussed in Note 4, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of storm costs, fuel costs, and asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 5.4 billion recorded as regulatory assets. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management s recorded balances for completeness.

REPORTS 

 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s and intervenors filings with the Commissions, that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following: 
 We inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable. 
 We utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances. 
 We compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance. 
 We obtained an analysis from management and letters from internal legal counsel for asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash costs, regarding probability of recovery for deferred costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery. 
 We obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Indiana, LLC 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Indiana, LLC and subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the Commission ), which has jurisdiction with respect to the electric rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 4, regulatory proceedings in recent years in Indiana have focused on the recoverability of fuel costs and asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 1.1 billion recorded as regulatory assets. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commission, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commission, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commission s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management s recorded balances for completeness.

REPORTS 

 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s and intervenors filings with the Commission, that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following: 
 We inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable. 
 We utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances. 
 We compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance. 
 We obtained an analysis from management and letters from internal legal counsel for asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash costs, regarding probability of recovery for deferred costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery. 
 We obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery.

REPORTS 

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements. 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the Tennessee Public Utility Commission (collectively the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the gas rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 511 million recorded as regulatory assets. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management s recorded balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s and intervenors filings with the Commissions, that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions.

 We inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable.

Duke Energy Carolinas Progress Energy Duke Energy Progress Duke Energy Florida Duke Energy Ohio Duke Energy Indiana Piedmont 
 In general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value and any depreciation already recognized, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable the asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if deemed recoverable (see discussion of long-lived asset impairments above). The carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. 
 When the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. See Note 11 for additional information. 
 Other Noncurrent Assets 
 Duke Energy, through a nonregulated subsidiary, was the winner of the Carolina Long Bay offshore wind auction in May 2022 and recorded an 
 asset of million related to the contract in Other within Other noncurrent assets. In November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay, which was moved to the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU I) segment.

 Sale of Commercial Renewables Segment 
 In August 2022, Duke Energy announced a strategic review of its commercial renewables business. Since 2007, Duke Energy has built a portfolio of commercial wind, solar and battery projects across the U.S., and established a development pipeline. Duke Energy has developed a strategy to focus on renewables, grid and other investment opportunities within its regulated operations. In November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay, which was moved to the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU I) segment. Duke Energy is actively marketing the business as separate disposal groups, the utility-scale solar and wind group and the distributed generation group (collectively, Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups). The sales processes for both Disposal Groups are ongoing and Duke Energy expects to dispose of these groups in the second half of 2023. 
 Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations 
 The Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups were classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. No adjustments were made to the historical activity within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these consolidated financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment assets to the estimated fair value of the business, based on the expected selling price less estimated cost to sell. These losses were included in Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax in Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The fair value was primarily determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows but also considered market information obtained through the bidding process. The discounted cash flow model utilized Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The fair value hierarchy levels are further discussed in Note 17. The impairment will be updated, if necessary, based on the final sales price, after any adjustments at closing for working capital and capital expenditures. 
 Duke Energy has elected not to separately disclose discontinued operations on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes Duke Energy's cash flows from discontinued operations related to the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.

 Other Sale Related Matters 
 Several Duke Energy renewables project companies, located in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, were named in several lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021. The legal actions related to these lawsuits will remain with Duke Energy and any future activity related to the matters will be presented in discontinued operations. See Note 5 for more information. 
 The Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups' debt and related interest rate swaps have not been classified as held for sale as they are not currently expected transfer to the buyer, but would be required to be extinguished as a result of the disposition. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of long-term debt including current maturities is billion. If the debt and related interest rate swaps do not transfer to the buyer and are terminated early, the expected total loss on extinguishment is approximately million, of which approximately million is expected to be attributable to Duke Energy. The loss would be recorded in discontinued operations when the debt and swaps are terminated. Hedge accounting was discontinued on the related interest rate swaps when the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups were classified as held for sale as the forecasted transactions being hedged are no longer probable. As a result, a gain of million was recorded in Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax in Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations as of December 31, 2022, of which million is attributable to Duke Energy. 
 Interest expense and debt issuance costs directly associated with the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups was allocated to discontinued operations. No interest from corporate level debt was allocated to discontinued operations. 
 The Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups have entered into negotiations to modify or terminate certain PPAs under which the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups sell power and RECs from renewable projects to offtakers. Duke Energy expects to pay offtakers approximately million to modify the agreements. Charges related to the modifications will be reflected within Loss From Discontinued Operations in Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Sale of Minority Interest in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC 
 minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction was completed following closings for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion. The first closing, which occurred on September 8, 2021, resulted in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC issuing of its membership interests in exchange for approximately billion or of the purchase price. The difference between the cash consideration received, net of transaction costs of approximately million, and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest is million and was recorded as an increase to equity. The second closing was completed in December 2022 and resulted in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC issuing an additional of its membership interests in exchange for approximately billion. The difference between the cash consideration received, net of transaction costs of approximately million, and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest is million and was recorded as an increase to equity. Duke Energy retained indirect control of these assets, and, therefore, no gain or loss was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for either transaction.

 customers were impacted. Total estimated operation and maintenance expenses incurred for restoration efforts for the year ended December 31, 2022, were approximately million, with an additional million in capital investments. Approximately million of the operation and maintenance expenses are deferred in Regulatory assets within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 million and million for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively). Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have regulatory tools to recover storm costs including deferral and securitization. These estimates could change as Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress receive additional information on actual costs. 
 Car bon Plan Proceeding 
 On October 13, 2021, North Carolina enacted legislation (Energy Solutions for North Carolina or HB 951) that established a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance North Carolina CO 2 emission reductions from electric generating facilities in the state through the use of least cost planning while providing for continued reliability and affordable rates for customers. Among other things, HB 951 directed that the NCUC approve an initial carbon plan (Carbon Plan) by December 31, 2022, taking all reasonable steps to achieve a reduction in CO 2 emissions from public utilities electric generating facilities in the state by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and achieve carbon neutrality from electric generating facilities by 2050 while maintaining affordability and reliability for customers. On May 16, 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan (Proposed Plan) with the NCUC. 
 The NCUC issued an order on December 30, 2022, adopting the first Carbon Plan. The order recognizes the value of an all-of-the-above approach to achieving CO 2 emission reductions and established a set of near-term procurement and development activities needed to continue progress towards the targeted CO 2 reductions, along with the schedule for the future biennial updates to the Carbon Plan. The approved near-term action plan includes procurement and development of solar, storage and hydrogen-capable natural gas generation at levels consistent with the Proposed Plan, along with upgrading key transmission facilities to strengthen the grid, improve resilience for customers and interconnect new solar generation and stakeholder engagement activities for onshore wind generation (in all cases, subject to any further applicable regulatory processes). The order also approved early development activities for long lead-time resources, including new nuclear, pumped-hydro storage and offshore wind transmission development. The NCUC affirmed the utility ownership structure required in HB 951; all new generation facilities or other resources selected by the NCUC to achieve the CO 2 emission reductions shall be owned and recovered on a cost-of-service basis by the utilities, with a carveout for of solar and solar plus storage generation to be procured through long-term purchase power agreements with third parties. The order approves continued utilization of the remaining coal-fired generation assets, ensuring that appropriate replacement generating units and associated transmission infrastructure are in service before existing generating units are retired and providing an orderly transition out of coal generation by 2035. 
 Storm Cost Securitization Legislation 
 On June 15, 2022, the South Carolina General Assembly unanimously adopted S. 1077 (Act 227) in both the House and Senate and the bill was signed into law on June 17, 2022. The legislation enables the PSCSC to permit the issuance of bonds for the payment of storm costs and the creation of a storm charge for repayment. 
 On August 5, 2022, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the PSCSC for review and approval of deferred storm costs to be securitized of approximately million. The evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on or after March 1, 2023. On February 7, 2023, a stipulation was reached with all parties in the proceeding regarding certain items identified through the Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS) audit of storm costs. The final amount for securitization will depend on the outcome of the hearing. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

 2023 North Carolina Rate Case 
 On January 19, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a PBR application with the NCUC to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. The PBR Application includes an MYRP to recover projected capital investments during the three year MYRP period. In addition to the MYRP, the PBR Application includes an Earnings Sharing Mechanism, Residential Decoupling Mechanism and Performance Incentive Mechanisms as required by HB 951. If approved, the overall retail revenue increase would be million in Year 1, million in Year 2 and million in Year 3, for a combined total of million or by early 2026. The rate increase is driven primarily by major transmission and distribution investments since the last rate case and projected in the MYRP, as well as investments in energy storage and solar assets included in the MYRP consistent with the Carbon Plan. Duke Energy Carolinas plans to implement temporary rates, subject to refund, on September 1, 2023, and has requested permanent rates be effective by January 1, 2024.

 years. The SLR would extend operations of the facility from to years. The current licenses for units 1 and 2 expire in 2033 and the license for unit 3 expires in 2034. By a Federal Register Notice dated July 28, 2021, the NRC provided a -day comment period for persons whose interest may be affected by the issuance of a subsequent renewed license for ONS to file a request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. On September 27, 2021, Beyond Nuclear and Sierra Club (Petitioners) filed a Hearing Request and Petition to Intervene (Hearing Request) and a Petition for Waiver. The Hearing Request proposed contentions and claimed that Duke Energy Carolinas did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, or the NRC s NEPA-implementing regulations. Following Duke Energy Carolinas' answer and the Petitioners' reply, on February 11, 2022, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) issued its decision on the Hearing Request and found that the Petitioners failed to establish that the proposed contentions are litigable. The ASLB also denied the Petitioners' Petition for Waiver and terminated the proceeding. 
 On February 24, 2022, the NRC issued a decision in the SLR appeal related to Florida Power and Light's Turkey Point nuclear generating station in Florida. The NRC ruled that the NRC s license renewal Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) does not apply to SLR because the GEIS does not address SLR. The decision overturned a 2020 NRC decision that found the GEIS applies to SLR. Although Turkey Point is not owned or operated by a Duke Energy Registrant, the NRC s order applies to all SLR applicants, including ONS. The NRC order also indicated no subsequent renewed licenses will be issued until the NRC staff has completed an adequate NEPA review for each application. On April 5, 2022, the NRC approved a 24-month rulemaking plan that will enable the NRC staff to complete an adequate NEPA review. Although an SLR applicant may wait until the rulemaking is completed, the NRC also noted that an applicant may submit a supplement to its environmental report providing information on environmental impacts during the SLR period prior to the rulemaking being completed. On November 7, 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas submitted a supplement to its environmental report addressing environmental impacts during the SLR period. On December 19, 2022, the NRC published a notice in the Federal Register that the NRC will conduct a limited scoping process to gather additional information necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts at ONS during the SLR period. The NRC received comments from the EPA and the Petitioners and these comments identify eighteen potential impacts that should be considered by the NRC in the EIS, which include, but are not limited to, climate change and flooding, environmental justice, severe accidents, and external events. Currently, the NRC expects to publish a draft EIS in October 2023. 
 On December 19, 2022, the NRC issued the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the safety portion of the SLR application. The NRC determined Duke Energy Carolinas met the requirements of the applicable regulations and identified actions that have been taken or will be taken to manage the effects of aging and address time-limited analyses. Duke Energy Carolinas and the NRC met with the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACR S) on February 2, 2023, to discuss issues regarding the SER and SLR application, after which the ACRS will issue a report discussing the result of its review. 
 Although the NRC s GEIS applicability decision will delay completion of the SLR proceeding, Duke Energy Carolinas does not believe it changes the probability that the ONS subsequent renewed licenses will ultimately be issued, although Duke Energy Carolinas cannot guarantee the outcome of the license application process. 
 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress intend to seek renewal of operating licenses and -year license extensions for all of their nuclear stations. New depreciation rates were implemented for all of the nuclear facilities during the second quarter of 2021. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of these additional relicensing proceedings.

 2021 Settlement Agreement 
 On January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a Settlement Agreement (the 2021 Settlement with the FPSC. The parties to the 2021 Settlement include Duke Energy Florida, the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, White Springs Agricultural Chemicals, Inc. d/b/a PCS Phosphate and NUCOR Steel Florida, Inc. (collectively, the Parties ). 
 Pursuant to the 2021 Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2024; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates of an incremental million in 2022, million in 2023 and million in 2024, subject to adjustment in the event of tax reform during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Parties also agreed to an ROE band of to with a midpoint of based on a capital structure of equity and debt. The ROE band can be increased by basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases basis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from to . On July 25, 2022, this provision was triggered. Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on August 12, 2022, to increase the ROE effective August 2022 with a base rate increase effective January 1, 2023. The FPSC approved this request on October 4, 2022. The 2021 Settlement Agreement also provided that Duke Energy Florida will be able to retain the million retail portion of the expected DOE award from its lawsuit to recover spent nuclear fuel to mitigate customer rates over the term of the 2021 Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida is permitted to recognize the million into earnings through the approved settlement period. The full amount of the million is expected to be recognized between the years of 2023 and 2024, while also remaining within the approved ROE band. Duke Energy Florida settled the DOE lawsuit and received payment of approximately million on June 15, 2022, of which the retail portion was approximately million. The 2021 Settlement authorizes Duke Energy Florida to collect the difference between million and the million retail portion of the amount received through the capacity cost recovery clause.

 million to flow back the expected 2023 PTCs and to flow back the expected 2022 PTCs via an adjustment to the capacity cost recovery clause. On December 14, 2022, the FPSC issued an order approving Duke Energy Florida s petition. See Note 24 for additional information on the IRA. 
 In addition to these terms, the 2021 Settlement contained provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately billion in future investments in new cost-effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida s Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things. The 2021 Settlement also resolved remaining unrecovered storm costs for Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian. 
 The FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024. 
 Clean Energy Connection 
 On July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the new solar generation facilities is approximately billion and the projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2024. This investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees and the credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021. 
 On February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC s order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida heard the oral argument on February 9, 2022. On May 27, 2022, the Supreme Court of Florida issued an order remanding the case back to the FPSC so that the FPSC can amend its order to better address some of the arguments raised by LULAC. On September 23, 2022, the FPSC issued a revised order and submitted it on September 26, 2022, to the Supreme Court of Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida requested that the parties file supplemental briefs regarding the revised order, which were filed February 6, 2023. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 Storm Protection Plan 
 On April 11, 2022, Duke Energy Florida filed a Storm Protection Plan for approval with the FPSC. The plan, which covers investments for the 2023-2032 time frame, reflects approximately billion of capital investment in transmission and distribution meant to strengthen its infrastructure, reduce outage times associated with extreme weather events, reduce restoration costs and improve overall service reliability. The evidentiary hearing began on August 2, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the FPSC voted to approve Duke Energy Florida's plan with one modification to remove the transmission loop radially fed program, representing a reduction of approximately million over the -year period starting in 2025. On December 9, 2022, the Office of Public Counsel filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Florida Supreme Court. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 Hurricane Ian 
 On September 28, 2022, much of Duke Energy Florida s service territory was impacted by Hurricane Ian, which caused significant damage resulting in more than million outages. Duke Energy Florida's December 31, 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheets include an estimate of approximately million related to deferred Hurricane Ian storm costs, consistent with the FPSC's storm rule, in Regulatory assets within Other Noncurrent Assets. After depleting any existing storm reserves, which were approximately million before Hurricane Ian, Duke Energy Florida is permitted to petition the FPSC for recovery of additional incremental operation and maintenance costs resulting from the storm and to replenish the retail customer storm reserve to approximately million. Duke Energy Florida filed its petition for cost recovery of various storms, including Hurricane Ian, and replenishment of the storm reserve on January 23, 2023, seeking recovery of million, for recovery over 12 months beginning with the first billing cycle in April 2023. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

 Natural Gas Pipeline Extension 
 Duke Energy Ohio installed a new natural gas pipeline (the Central Corridor Project) in its Ohio service territory to increase system reliability and enable the retirement of older infrastructure. Construction of the pipeline extension was completed and placed in service on March 14, 2022, with a total cost of approximately million (excluding overheads and AFUDC). 
 MGP Cost Recovery 
 In an order issued in 2013, the PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio's deferral and recovery of costs related to environmental remediation at sites (East End and West End) that housed former MGP operations. Duke Energy Ohio made annual applications with the PUCO to recover its incremental remediation costs consistent with the PUCO s directive in Duke Energy Ohio s 2012 natural gas base rate case. 
 A Stipulation and Recommendation was filed jointly by Duke Energy Ohio, the Staff, the Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel and the Ohio Energy Group on August 31, 2021, which was approved without modification by the PUCO on April 20, 2022. T he Stipulation and Recommendation resolved all open issues regarding MGP remediation costs incurred between 2013 and 2019, Duke Energy Ohio s request for additional deferral authority beyond 2019 and the pending issues related to the Tax Act described below as it related to Duke Energy Ohio s natural gas operations. As a result of the approval of the Stipulation and Recommendation, Duke Energy Ohio recognized pretax charges of approximately million to Operating revenues, regulated natural gas and million to Operation, maintenance and other and a tax benefit of million to Income Tax (Benefit) Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Stipulation and Recommendation further acknowledged Duke Energy Ohio s ability to file a request for additional deferral authority in the future related to environmental remediation of any MGP impacts in the Ohio River, if necessary, subject to specific conditions.

 2019 Indiana Rate Case 
 On July 2, 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately million. The rebuttal case, filed on December 4, 2019, updated the requested revenue requirement to result in a or million average retail rate increase, including the impacts of the utility receipts tax. On June 29, 2020, the IURC issued an order in the rate case approving a revenue increase of million before certain adjustments and ratemaking refinements. The order approved Duke Energy Indiana's requested forecasted rate base of billion as of December 31, 2020, including the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Plant. The IURC reduced Duke Energy Indiana's request by slightly more than million, when accounting for the utility receipts tax and other adjustments. Approximately of the reduction was due to a prospective change in depreciation and use of regulatory asset for the end-of-life inventory at retired generating plants, approximately was due to the approved ROE of versus the requested ROE of and approximately was related to miscellaneous earnings neutral adjustments. Step one rates were estimated to be approximately of the total and became effective on July 30, 2020. Step two rates estimated to be the remaining of the total rate increase were approved on July 28, 2021, and implemented in August 2021. 
 Several groups appealed the IURC order to the Indiana Court of Appeals. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the IURC decision on May 13, 2021. However, upon appeal by the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) and the Duke Industrial Group on March 10, 2022, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the IURC erred in allowing Duke Energy Indiana to recover coal ash costs incurred before the IURC s rate case order in June 2020. The Indiana Supreme Court found that allowing Duke Energy Indiana to recover coal ash costs incurred between rate cases that exceeded the amount built into base rates violated the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking. The IURC s order has been remanded to the IURC for additional proceedings consistent with the Indiana Supreme Court s opinion. As a result of the court's opinion, Duke Energy Indiana recognized pretax charges of approximately million to Impairment of assets and other charges and million to Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. Duke Energy Indiana filed a request for rehearing with the Supreme Court on April 11, 2022, which the court denied on May 26, 2022. Duke Energy Indiana filed its testimony in the remand proceeding on August 18, 2022. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin March 3, 2023.

 As a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion s decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project. 
 As part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately billion recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation o f the ACP pipeline project.

 Potential Coal Plant Retirements 
 The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file IRPs with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in North Carolina and Indiana earlier than their current estimated useful l ives. The NCUC concluded in its Carbon Plan order that the projected retirements dates presented by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in their Carbon Plan for coal-fired generating facilities were reasonable for planning purposes and further directed that appropriate steps be taken to optimally retire the coal fleet according to such schedule. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these assets are retired.

 In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas , Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available. 
 Nuclear Liability Coverage 
 The Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately billion, is subject to change every five years for inflation and for the number of licensed reactors. Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary coverage. The U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims. 
 Primary Liability Insurance 
 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by law, which is million per station. Duke Energy Florida has purchased million primary nuclear liability insurance for Crystal River in compliance with the law. 
 Excess Liability Program 
 This program provides billion of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act s mandatory industrywide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of million times the current licensed commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. Under this program, operating unit licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate not to exceed million per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes.

 Each nuclear facility has accident property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of billion, except for Crystal River Unit 3. Crystal River Unit 3 s limit is million and is on an actual cash value basis. All nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional billion nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. Catawba has a dedicated billion of additional nuclear accident insurance limit above its dedicated underlying limit. Catawba and Oconee also have an additional million of non-nuclear accident property damage limit. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles. 
 NEIL s Accidental Outage policy provides some coverage, similar to business interruption, for losses in the event of a major accident property damage outage of a nuclear unit. Coverage is provided on a weekly limit basis after a significant waiting period deductible and at of the applicable weekly limits for 52 weeks and of the applicable weekly limits for up to the next 110 weeks. Coverage is provided until these applicable weekly periods are met, where the accidental outage policy limit will not exceed million for Catawba, McGuire, Harris, Brunswick, Oconee and Robinson. NEIL sublimits the accidental outage recovery up to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed million from non-nuclear accidental property damage. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles. 
 Potential Retroactive Premium Assessments 
 In the event of NEIL losses, NEIL s board of directors may assess member companies' retroactive premiums of amounts up to times their annual premiums for up to after a loss. NEIL has never exercised this assessment.

 ENVIRONMENTAL 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants. The following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 Remediation Activities 
 In addition to AROs recorded as a result of various environmental regulations, discussed in Note 10, the Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include certain properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, remediation activities vary based upon site conditions and location, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for environmental impacts caused by other potentially responsible parties and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined at all sites. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.

 LITIGATION 
 Duke Energy 
 Michael Johnson et al. v. Duke Energy Corporation et al. 
 On September 23, 2020, plaintiff Michael Johnson, a former Duke Energy employee and participant in the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan (Plan) brought suit on his own behalf and on behalf of other participants and beneficiaries similarly situated against Duke Energy Corporation, the Duke Energy Benefits Committee, and other unnamed individual defendants. The complaint, which was subsequently amended to add a current participant as a plaintiff on November 23, 2020, alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties with respect to certain fees associated with the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and seeks certification of a class of all individuals who were participants or beneficiaries of the Plan at any time on or after September 23, 2014. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs amended complaint on December 18, 2020. On January 31, 2022, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. On February 28, 2022, Duke Energy responded to the amended complaint. Discovery commenced and the parties exchanged preliminary disclosures. After review of these disclosures, the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss the suit and the parties subsequently filed a joint stipulation of voluntary dismissal with prejudice on April 29, 2022, ending this litigation. 
 Texas Storm Uri Tort Litigation 
 Duke Energy Corporation and several Duke Energy renewables project companies in the ERCOT market were named in more than thirty lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021. Duke Energy Corporation was dismissed from the suits, leaving two suits in which individual wind and solar projects are named. These lawsuits seek recovery for property damages, personal injury and wrongful death allegedly caused by the power outages that plaintiffs claim were the collective failure of generators, transmission and distribution utilities ("TDUs"), retail energy providers, natural gas providers, co-ops and municipalities that generate power and ERCOT, all of which were originally sued by all plaintiffs. The cases were consolidated into a Texas state court multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding for discovery and pre-trial motions. cases were designated for motions to dismiss and all other cases were stayed. On January 28, 2023, the Court denied the generators' and TDUs' motions to dismiss the negligence claims but dismissed the tortious interference and conspiracy claims. The motions to dismiss ERCOT and the natural gas defendants were also granted. The generator and TDU defendants filed a petition for mandamus in each of the five cases seeking to overturn the denials on February 10, 2023. If the Texas Court of Appeals accepts the appeals, it will set a briefing schedule. The remaining cases that are part of the MDL are currently stayed, except that plaintiffs have been given leave to amend their pleadings. Plaintiffs began amending existing lawsuits and filing new lawsuits on behalf of hundreds of plaintiffs against hundreds of defendants, including in some cases, by again naming Duke Energy Corporation and naming, for the first time, Duke Energy Renewables, LLC. Plaintiffs have also re-named ERCOT as a defendant. As new cases are served, they are being brought into the MDL and are subject to the stay in the MDL proceeding. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcomes of these matters. See Note 2 for more information related to the sale of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.

 million and million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in the reserves is a result of a third-party study completed in 2021 as well as settlements made throughout the year. These reserves are based upon Duke Energy Carolinas' best estimate for current and future asbestos claims through 2042 and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2042 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves. 
 Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were million and million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets and Receivables within Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating. 
 The reserve for credit losses for insurance receivables for the asbestos-related injuries and damages is million for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The insurance receivable is evaluated based on the risk of default and the historical losses, current conditions and expected conditions around collectability. Management evaluates the risk of default annually based on payment history, credit rating and changes in the risk of default from credit agencies.

Generally, the rate used by the lessor is not provided to Duke Energy and in these cases the incremental borrowing rate is used. Duke Energy will typically use its fully collateralized incremental borrowing rate as of the commencement date to calculate and record the lease. The incremental borrowing rate is influenced by the lessee s credit rating and lease term and as such may differ for individual leases, embedded leases or portfolios of leased assets.

 AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES 
 Master Credit Facility 
 In March 2022, Duke Energy amended its existing Master Credit Facility to increase the amount of the facility from billion to billion and to extend the termination date to March 2027. The Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to a specified sublimit for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder.

 Duke Energy (Parent) Term Loan Facility 
 On March 9, 2022, Duke Energy (Parent) entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with commitments totaling billion maturing on March 9, 2024. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement may be extended for up to by request of Duke Energy (Parent), upon satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the facility were used to repay amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of a portion of Duke Energy's outstanding commercial paper. In December 2022, Duke Energy (Parent) repaid million of the term loan. The balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Revolving Credit Facility was terminated in March 2022. 
 Duke Energy Florida Term Loan Facility 
 In October 2022, Duke Energy Florida entered into a term loan facility with commitments totaling million expiring in April 2024. The term loan was fully drawn at the time of closing In October and borrowings were used for storm costs, under-collected fuel and general company purposes. The balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Other Debt Matters 
 In September 2022, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities, including preferred stock, in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement was filed to replace a similar prior filing upon expiration of its term and also allows for the issuance of common and preferred stock by Duke Energy. 
 Also in September 2022, to replace another similar prior filing, Duke Energy filed an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to billion of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor s option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, was million and million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Money Pool and Intercompany Credit Agreements 
 The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, are eligible to receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Money pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the Subsidiary Registrants Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies on the Subsidiary Registrants Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 In March 2022, Progress Energy closed a revolving credit agreement with Duke Energy (Parent), which allowed up to billion in intercompany borrowings.

 for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2022, Duke Energy presented approximately million of long-term debt as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of a technical default due to the bankruptcy filing of a Duke Energy customer. The Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all other covenants related to their debt agreements as of December 31, 2022. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses. 
 Other Loans 
 As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, Duke Energy had loans outstanding of million, including million at Duke Energy Progress and million, including million at Duke Energy Progress, respectively, against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives.

 million, the majority of which expire by 2028. 
 In October 2017, ACP executed a billion revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. In July 2020, ACP reduced the size of the credit facility to billion. Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee was million as of December 31, 2020. This amount represented of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and was recognized within Other Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, of which million was previously recognized due the adoption of new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. See Notes 4 and 13 for more information. 
 In addition to the Spectra Capital and ACP revolving credit facility guarantees above, Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of these entities. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of December 31, 2022, was million of which all expire between 2024 and 2030, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration. Additionally, certain guarantees have uncapped maximum potential payments; however, Duke Energy does not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
 Duke Energy uses bank-issued standby letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations to the issuing bank that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At December 31, 2022, Duke Energy had issued a total of million in letters of credit, which expire between 2023 and 2028. The unused amount under these letters of credit was million. 
 million and million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, primarily in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the guarantees discussed above. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.

 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the prices of electricity purchased and sold in bulk power markets and natural gas purchases, including Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets and delivery locations. To manage risk associated with commodity prices, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into long-term power purchase or sales contracts and long-term natural gas supply agreements. 
 Undesignated Contracts 
 For the Subsidiary Registrants, bulk power electricity and natural gas purchases flow through fuel adjustment clauses, formula-based contracts or other cost sharing mechanisms. Differences between the costs included in rates and the incurred costs, including undesignated derivative contracts, are largely deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Piedmont policies allow for the use of financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks. The strategy and objective of these hedging programs are to use the financial instruments to reduce natural gas cost volatility for customers.

 Duke Energy may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives fair value gains or losses and hedged items fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates.

 Receivables Financing DERF/DEPR/DEFR 
 DERF, DEPR and DEFR are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned LLCs with separate legal existence from their parent companies, and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and related services from their parent companies. 
 DERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the amount of qualified receivables purchased, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt. 
 The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions. 
 Receivables Financing CRC 
 CRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC borrows amounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing availability from the credit facility is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold to CRC, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility are reflected on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt.

 cash and in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of million. 
 CRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity is not held by the equity holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are funded by Duke Energy. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of CRC are decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates CRC as it makes these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidate CRC.

 DEFPF is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida's unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3. 
 In 2016, DEFPF issued senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida. 
 DEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF.

 Duke Energy has investments in various joint ventures including pipeline and renewable natural gas projects. These entities are considered VIEs due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does not consolidate these entities. 
 Duke Energy has a ownership interest in ACP. In 2020, Duke Energy determined that it would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee.

The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REVENUE 

Duke Energy Progress Duke Energy Florida Duke Energy Indiana 
 Revenues for block sales are recognized monthly as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates. 
 Gas Utilities and Infrastructure 
 GU I earns its revenue through retail and wholesale natural gas service through the transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale natural gas service customers with all natural gas load requirements. Additionally, while natural gas can be stored, substantially all natural gas provided by Duke Energy is consumed by customers simultaneously with receipt of delivery. 
 Retail natural gas service is marketed throughout Duke Energy's natural gas service territory using published tariff rates. The tariff rates are established by regulators in Duke Energy's service territories. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, have multiple components, such as a commodity charge, demand charge, customer or monthly charge and transportation costs. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing natural gas service. For contracts where Duke Energy provides all of the customer s natural gas needs, the delivery of natural gas is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time, and revenue is recognized monthly based on billings and unbilled estimates as service is provided and the commodity is consumed over the billing period. Additionally, natural gas service is typically at-will and customers can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Duke Energy also adheres to applicable regulatory requirements to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and receivable and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary.

 Disaggregated Revenues 
 For the EU I and GU I segments, revenue by customer class is most meaningful to Duke Energy as each respective customer class collectively represents unique customer expectations of service, generally has different energy and demand requirements, and operates under tailored, regulatory approved pricing structures. Additionally, each customer class is impacted differently by weather and a variety of economic factors including the level of population growth, economic investment, employment levels, and regulatory activities in each of Duke Energy s jurisdictions. As such, analyzing revenues disaggregated by customer class allows Duke Energy to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

 Trade and other receivables are evaluated based on an estimate of the risk of loss over the life of the receivable and current and historical conditions using supportable assumptions. Management evaluates the risk of loss for trade and other receivables by comparing the historical write-off amounts to total revenue over a specified period. Historical loss rates are adjusted due to the impact of current conditions, as well as forecasted conditions over a reasonable time period. The calculated write-off rate can be applied to the receivable balance for which an established reserve does not already exist. Management reviews the assumptions and risk of loss periodically for trade and other receivables.

 PERFORMANCE AWARDS 
 Stock-based performance awards generally vest after to the extent performance targets are met. The actual number of shares issued will range from to of target shares, depending on the level of performance achieved. 
 Performance awards contain performance conditions and a market condition. The performance conditions are based on Duke Energy's cumulative adjusted EPS and total incident case rate (total incident case rate is one of our key employee safety metrics). The market condition is based on TSR of Duke Energy relative to a predefined peer group. 
 Relative TSR is valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energy s performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the predefined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy s relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy s relative TSR associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy s relative TSR for each grant are incorporated within the model. For performance awards granted in 2022, the model used a risk-free interest rate of , which reflects the yield on three-year Treasury bonds as of the grant date, and an expected volatility of based on Duke Energy's historical volatility over three years using daily stock prices.

Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain executives. The qualified and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants. 
 Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets on December 31, 2022, were primarily attributable to actual investment performance that was less than expected investment performance. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2022, were primarily attributable to the increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets as of December 31, 2021, were primarily attributable to actual investment performance that was less than expected investment performance. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2021, were primarily attributable to the increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations. 
 As a result of the application of settlement accounting due to total lump-sum benefit payments exceeding the settlement threshold (defined as the sum of service cost and interest cost on projected benefit obligation components of net periodic benefit costs) for one of its qualified pension plans, Duke Energy recognized settlement charges of million, of which million was recorded to Regulatory Assets within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and million was recorded to Other Income and Expenses, net, within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as of December 31, 2022. 
 Settlement charges recognized by the Subsidiary Registrants as of December 31, 2022, which represent amounts allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants and allocated charges for their proportionate share of settlement charges for employees of Duke Energy's shared services affiliate, and recorded to Regulatory Assets within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were million for Duke Energy Carolinas, million for Progress Energy, million for Duke Energy Progress, million for Duke Energy Florida, million for Duke Energy Indiana and million for Piedmont. Settlement charges recognized by the Subsidiary Registrants as of December 31, 2022, recorded to Other Income and Expenses, net, within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations were million for Duke Energy Carolinas, million for Progress Energy, million for Duke Energy Progress, million for Duke Energy Florida, million for Duke Energy Ohio and million for Piedmont. 
 The settlement charges reflect the recognition of a pro-rata portion of previously unrecognized actuarial losses, equal to the percentage of reduction in the projected benefit obligation resulting from total lump-sum benefit payments as of December 31, 2022. Settlement charges recognized as a regulatory asset within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are amortized over the average remaining service period for participants in the plan. Amortization of settlement charges is disclosed in the tables below as a component of net periodic pension costs. 
 Effective December 31, 2022, Duke Energy Florida changed its method for calculating the market related value of plan assets (MRVA) from the fair value method to a method that recognizes changes in fair value of its plan assets over a period. This represents a change in regulatory treatment that will serve to mitigate the impact of market volatility on retail customer rates, resulting in the timing of net periodic pension cost recognition that is more consistent with treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. The three-year retrospective impact of this method change of million was recognized by Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Florida, respectively, and was recorded to Other Income and Expenses, net, within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and has been disclosed in the tables below as a component of net periodic pension costs. 
 Net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented prior to capitalization of amounts reflected as Net property, plant and equipment, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Only the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is eligible to be capitalized. The remaining non-capitalized portions of net periodic benefit costs are classified as either: (1) service cost, which is recorded in Operations, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations; or as (2) components of non-service cost, which is recorded in Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Subsidiary Registrants also include allocated net periodic benefit costs for their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy s shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants.

 The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.

 Description and Allocations 
 Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust 
 Assets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust. Approximately of the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and approximately were allocated to other post-retirement plans (comprised of 401(h) accounts), as of December 31, 2022, and 2021. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust is to invest in a diverse portfolio of assets that is expected to generate positive surplus return over time (i.e., asset growth greater than liability growth) subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Duke Energy assumes qualified pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of for the RCBP pension and RCBP 401(h) account assets and for the DELPP pension and DELPP 401(h) account assets. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension plan. Return seeking debt securities, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the target asset allocation for the RCBP assets is liability hedging and return-seeking assets and the target asset allocation for the DELPP assets is liability hedging assets and return-seeking assets. Duke Energy periodically reviews its asset allocation targets, and over time, as the funded status of the benefit plans increase, the level of asset risk relative to plan liabilities may be reduced to better manage Duke Energy's benefit plan liabilities and reduce funded status volatility. 
 The Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust is authorized to engage in the lending of certain plan assets. Securities lending is an investment management enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust to earn additional income. Securities lending involves the loaning of securities to approved parties. In return for the loaned securities, the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust receives collateral in the form of cash and securities as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return of the loan under terms that permit the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust to sell the securities. The Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust mitigates credit risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair value of the securities loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. The fair value of securities on loan was approximately million and million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Securities lending income earned by the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 Duke Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 17. 
 Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows: 
 Investments in equity securities 
 Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. When the price of an institutional commingled fund is unpublished, it is not categorized in the fair value hierarchy, even though the funds are readily available at the fair value. 
 Investments in corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities 
 Most debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 2. 
 Investments in short-term investment funds 
 Investments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end and are readily redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued as Level 2.

 million to its North Carolina deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of this deferred tax liability reduction was offset by recording a regulatory liability pending NCUC determination of the disposition of the amounts related to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont. In addition, Duke Energy recorded a net reduction of North Carolina consolidating deferred tax assets of approximately million to deferred state income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2021. North Carolina SB 105 did not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress or Piedmont. 
 Consolidated Appropriations Act 
 On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) was signed into law. In addition to the CAA providing funding for government operations, it also provided tax provisions to assist with COVID-19 relief, including extending certain expiring tax provisions. The company has reviewed the provisions of the CAA and has determined that there are no material impacts on the financial statements as a result of the CAA being signed into law. 
 CARES Act 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted. The CARES Act was an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act accelerated the remaining AMT credit refund allowances resulting in taxpayers being able to immediately claim a refund in full for any AMT credit carryforwards and provided for the deferral of certain 2020 payroll taxes. In the third quarter of 2020, Duke Energy received million related to these AMT credit carryforwards and million of interest income. In addition, the company deferred approximately million of payroll taxes, of which, 50 were paid by December 31, 2021, with the remaining 50 payable by December 31, 2022. The other provisions within the CARES Act did not materially impact Duke Energy's income tax accounting.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, and have concluded no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Duke Energy Registrants management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with GAAP. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework in the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Deloitte Touche LLP, Duke Energy s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. This report is not applicable to the Subsidiary Registrants as these companies are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.

REPORTS 

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 (c) Notwithstanding Sections 2(a) or 2(b), a pro-rated portion of the Restricted Stock Units that has not yet vested under this Section 2 shall immediately vest if, prior to the applicable Vesting Date (and other than as provided in Section 2(b)(ii) above) (i) the Corporation and its Subsidiaries terminate Grantee's employment other than for cause, death or Disability, including

 Section 3. Forfeiture . The Restricted Stock Units that have not yet vested pursuant to Section 2 (including without limitation any right to Dividend Equivalents described in Section 5 hereof relating to dividends payable on or after the date of forfeiture) shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice if (a) Grantee ceases to be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary other than as provided in Sections 2(b) or 2(c), or (b) the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 6.

All other legal and contractual protections governing the Confidential Information of the Corporation and or its Subsidiaries remain in full force and effect and are not altered or in any manner reduced by the terms of this subsection (v). 
 
 (B) Grantee further agrees not to publish or provide any oral or written statements about the Corporation or any Subsidiary, any of the Corporation's or any Subsidiary's current or former officers, executives, directors, employees, agents or representatives that are false, disparaging or defamatory, or that disclose private or confidential information about their business or personal affairs.

 6

 (c) If any part of this Section 6 is held to be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or geographical area covered, the Corporation and Grantee agree to modify such part, or that the court or arbitrator making such holding shall have the power to modify such part, to reduce its duration, scope or geographical area. 
 
 (d) Nothing in Section 6 shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from being retained during the Restricted Period in a capacity as an attorney licensed to practice law, or to restrict Grantee from providing advice and counsel in such capacity, in any jurisdiction where such prohibition or restriction is contrary to law.

This provision shall be construed as a return of consideration or ill-gotten gains due to the failure of Grantee's promises under the Agreement, and not as a liquidated damages clause. Nothing herein shall (x) reduce or eliminate the Corporation's right to assert that the restrictions provided for in this agreement are fully enforceable as written, or as modified by a court pursuant to Section 6, or (y) eliminate, reduce, or compromise the application of temporary or permanent injunctive relief as a fully appropriate and applicable remedy to enforce the restrictions provided for in Section 6 (inclusive of its subparts), in addition to recovery of damages or other remedies otherwise allowed by law. 
 
 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Corporation determines at any time that the Grantee engaged in Detrimental Activity (defined below) while employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Grantee (a) shall not be entitled to any further Shares, Dividend Equivalents or other amounts hereunder (and, if it is determined that a participant may have engaged in Detrimental Activity, payment of any Shares, Dividend Equivalents or other amounts otherwise due to the Grantee shall be suspended pending resolution to the Corporation s satisfaction of any investigation of the matter), and (b) shall be required to promptly return to the Corporation, upon notice from the Corporation, any Shares, Dividend Equivalents or other amounts received under this Agreement by the Grantee during the three-year period preceding the date of the determination by the Corporation. To the extent that Shares, Dividend Equivalents or other amounts are not immediately returned or paid to the Corporation as provided in this paragraph, the Corporation may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, seek other remedies, including a set off of the Shares, Dividend Equivalents or other amounts so payable to it against any amounts that may be owing from time to time by the Corporation or an affiliate to the Grantee. For 
 7 

purposes of this paragraph, Detrimental Activity means (i) the engaging by the Grantee in misconduct that is detrimental to the financial condition or business reputation of the Corporation or its affiliates, including due to any adverse publicity, or (ii) the Grantee s breach or violation of any material written policy of the Corporation, including without limitation the Corporation s Code of Business Ethics or any written policy or regulation dealing with workplace harassment, including sexual harassment and other forms of harassment prohibited by the Corporation s Harassment-Free Workplace Policy. 
 
 Section 7 . Change in Control . Vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall not accelerate solely as a result of a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing entity, as the case may be, may, without Grantee's consent, either assume or continue the Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award or other consideration in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement. 
 
 Section 8 . Withholding . To the extent the Corporation or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes in connection with the delivery of Shares under this Agreement, then the Corporation or Subsidiary (as applicable) shall retain a number of Shares otherwise deliverable hereunder with a value equal to the required withholding (based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of delivery) provided that in no event shall the value of the Shares retained exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld or such other amount permitted under the Plan. 
 Section 9. Conflicts with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee's Consent . In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award properly granted to Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document. 
 To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and made without the consent of Grantee). For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid to Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole discretion unless Grantee has signed a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the signed duplicate to the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department Restricted Stock Units, Duke

 Name of Grantee ________________________________ 
 Target # of Performance Shares ________________________________

 Performance Period The three-year period commencing on January 1 of the year in which the Date of Grant occurs 
 Section 1. Nature of Performance Shares . Each Performance Share, upon becoming vested, represents a right to receive payment in the form of one (1) share of Common Stock (a Share ). Performance Shares are used solely as units of measurement and are not Shares, and Grantee is not , and has no rights as, a shareholder of the Corporation by virtue of this Award. 
 Section 2. Vesting of Performance Shares . Subject to Section 3 and 6 below, the Performance Shares shall vest as follows 
 (a) The Performance Shares shall vest only if and to the extent the Committee determines that the Performance Goals (as defined in Exhibit A) have been met for the Performance Period set forth above. 
 (b) In general, Grantee must be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on the last day of the Performance Period to be entitled to payment of any Performance Shares earned under Section 2(a) above. However, Grantee shall be entitled to a pro-rated portion of the Performance Shares earned under Section 2(a) above in the event that, during the Performance Period (i) Grantee ceases to be employed with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries by reason of death or Disability (defined by reference Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), (ii) the Corporation and its Subsidiaries terminate Grantee's employment other than for cause (as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion), or (iii) Grantee voluntarily terminates employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries after having attained age 55 and completed 10 years of consecutive service from Grantee s most recent date of hire or re-hire, as applicable (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time). The pro-rated portion of the Performance Shares that becomes payable under this Section 2(b), if any, shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, based upon Grantee's continuous employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries during the Performance Period (including additional service credit provided to Grantee, if any, under an employment or change in control agreement with the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or a severance 

plan maintained by the Corporation or a Subsidiary, as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if Grantee is a member of the Senior Management Committee on the Date of Grant, Grantee shall be entitled to all (rather than a pro-rated portion) of the Performance Shares earned under Section 2(a) above in the event that, during the Performance Period, Grantee ceases to be employed with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries by reason of death or voluntary termination of employment after having attained age 60 and completed five years of consecutive service from Grantee s most recent date of hire or re-hire, as applicable (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time), but only if such death or voluntary termination occurs following the completion of the first year of the Performance Period. 
 (c) For purposes of Section 2 of this Agreement, the continuous employment of Grantee with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to have been interrupted, and Grantee shall not be deemed to have ceased to be an employee, by reason of the transfer of his or her employment among the Corporation and its Subsidiaries or a leave of absence approved by the Corporation or a Subsidiary provided that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Corporation shall pro-rate the payout of any Performance Shares earned in the event Grantee is on an approved but unpaid leave of absence during the Performance Period, based upon the portion of the Performance Period during which Grantee received payment of salary (as determined under such rules as may be established by the Corporation from time-to-time). 
 Section 3 . Forfeiture . The Performance Shares (including without limitation any right to accumulated Dividend Equivalents described in Section 5 hereof) shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice if (a) Grantee ceases to be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to the last day of the Performance Period other than as provided in Section 2(b), or (b) the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is in violation of any obligation identified in Section 6. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that payments made under this Agreement are subject to the Corporation's requirement that the Grantee reimburse the portion of any payment where such portion of the payment was (i) inadvertently paid based on an incorrect calculation, or (ii) predicated upon the achievement of financial results that are subsequently the subject of a restatement caused or partially caused by Grantee's fraud or misconduct. 
 Section 4 . Payment of Performance Shares . Payment of the Performance Shares earned under Section 2 above shall be made to Grantee by March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the end of the Performance Period, except to the extent deferred by Grantee in accordance with procedures as the Committee, or its delegate, may prescribe from time to time. Payment of vested Performance Shares shall be in the form of one (1) Share for each full Performance Share earned, and any fractional Share shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of Shares provided that if payment would be less than ten (10) Shares, then, if so determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, payment may be made in cash in lieu of Shares. 
 Section 5 . Dividend Equivalents . Upon payment of a Performance Share, Grantee shall be entitled to a cash payment (without interest) equal to the aggregate cash dividends declared and payable with respect to one (1) Share for each record date that occurs during the period beginning on the Date of Grant 
 2 

and ending on the date the Performance Share is paid (the Dividend Equivalent ). The Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited to the extent that the underlying Performance Share is forfeited and shall be paid to Grantee, if at all, at the same time that the related Performance Share is paid in accordance with Section 4 above. Dividend Equivalents will be subject to any required withholding for federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes.

To the extent the Corporation or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes in connection with the delivery of Shares under this Agreement, then the Corporation or Subsidiary (as applicable) shall retain a number of Shares otherwise deliverable hereunder with a value equal to the required withholding (based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of delivery) provided that in no event shall the value of the Shares retained exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld or such other amount permitted under the Plan. If the Corporation or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local or other taxes at any time other than upon delivery of the Shares under this Agreement (for example, if Grantee elects to defer payment of the Performance Shares), then the Corporation or Subsidiary (as applicable) shall have the right in its sole discretion to (a) require Grantee to pay or provide for payment of the required tax withholding, or (b) deduct the required tax withholding from any amount of salary, bonus, incentive compensation or other amounts otherwise payable in cash to Grantee (other than deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code). 
 Section 9 . Conflicts with Plan, Correction of Errors, Section 409A and Grantee's Consent . In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts in any way with a provision of the Plan, such Plan provision shall be controlling and the applicable provision of this Agreement shall be without force and effect to the extent necessary to cause such Plan provision to be controlling. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. In the event that, due to administrative error, this Agreement does not accurately reflect an Award properly granted to Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation, acting through its Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, reserves the right to cancel any erroneous document and, if appropriate, to replace the cancelled document with a corrected document. 
 To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and that this Award not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Grantee under Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause this Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and made without the consent of Grantee). For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid to Grantee pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Award is subject to cancellation by the Corporation in its sole discretion unless Grantee has signed a duplicate of this Agreement, in the space provided below, and returned the signed duplicate to the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department Performance Shares, _________________________, which, if, and to the extent, permitted by the Executive Compensation and Benefits Department, may be accomplished by electronic means.
