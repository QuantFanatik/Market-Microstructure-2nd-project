Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings. 

Except as disclosed in the following seven paragraphs,
there are no legal proceedings pending or proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities against any of Synchrony Credit
Card Master Note Trust (the Issuing Entity ), Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA ), as
indenture trustee (the Indenture Trustee ), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly known as BNYM (Delaware)) (the
 Owner Trustee ), Synchrony Bank (the Sponsor ), the RFS Holding, L.L.C. (the Depositor or SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL (the Servicer or of which any property of the foregoing is subject, that are material to
holders of the notes of Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust. 

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of
New York Mellon, an affiliate of the Owner Trustee, is named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of
certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as
a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under
the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties
to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon
denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously. 

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their
role as trustees of certain RMBS trusts. 

On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including
funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State
Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce
breaches of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage
loan servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme
Court and refiled two separate cases, one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY
Case and the other in the Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ).
Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018 and the BlackRock California
Case was dismissed on January 11, 2019. 

On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as
a defendant to a case brought by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts
at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC.
DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs 
third amended complaint brings claims for violation of the Trust Indenture Act, as amended (the TIA ); breach of contract;
breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However,
in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs 
TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain
theories of plaintiffs breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs
allege damages of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third
amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs,
jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27,
2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022,
the court issued an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC
and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of
that order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March 10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s orders on the motions to dismiss and for
summary judgment. 

On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as
a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30,
2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1
of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings
claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of
the covenant of good faith. However, in the second amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case,
the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit
Act claims and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal.
The second amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, 
but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer
to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7,
2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the
court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion
for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and theories were dismissed with prejudice.
Discovery is ongoing. 

On December 30, 2015, IKB International,
S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed
a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts.
On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty
to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of New York s Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation
of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On
October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss.
On January 6, 2017, IKB filed a notice of discontinuance, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to three trusts.
On June 20, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to four additional trusts.
On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court granted the
motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the
TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed
a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding certain aspects of the court s
order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order.
On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the court s
order on the motion to dismiss. On September 30, 2022, IKB filed a motion for reargument or for leave to appeal to the Court
of Appeals as to certain aspects of the First Department s decision. On September 30, 2022, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion
for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals as to other aspects of that decision. The First Department granted DBNTC and DBTCA s
motion and denied IKB s motion. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s
order on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to
the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven
additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to
one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to
17 certificates at issue, including all claims as to 5 trusts. On February 28, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily
dismissing with prejudice all claims as to two trusts, leaving 15 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing.

MANAGEMENT S ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE 

Management of the Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company is responsible for assessing
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine
which criteria are applicable to the Company in respect of the servicing platform described below. Management has determined that the
servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: 

Platform : Publicly-issued i.e. , transaction-level reporting
required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e. , for which transaction-level
reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities
and other asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator,
securities administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities
sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform (see Appendix A). 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the Company
with respect to the Platform as to any transaction, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which
management has determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (the Applicable
Servicing Criteria ). With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) there
were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 

Period : Year ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Management's interpretation of Applicable Servicing Criteria :
The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) is applicable only with respect to its continuing
obligation to act as, or locate a, successor servicer under the circumstances referred to in certain transaction agreements. It is management's
interpretation that the Company has no other active back-up servicing responsibilities in regards to servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) as
of and for the Period. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to
the activities the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the
accurate conveyance of such information within reports to investors. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s
obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. 

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company s
management provides the following assertion of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

The
 Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with
 the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assertion of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
as of and for the Period.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors 
SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL: 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying
 Management s Assessment of Compliance , that SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust asset-backed
securities transactions for which the Company acted as servicer involving private label and co-branded credit card receivables (such asset-backed
securities transactions, the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii),
1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(2)(vii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs
with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The Company has determined
that Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates
to the conveyance of information in the monthly noteholder statements delivered to the trustee. With respect to applicable Servicing Criterion
1122(d)(4)(xv), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022
with respect to the Platform because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix
B to Management s Assessment of Compliance identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by
management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria
based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing
activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors
may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement.

As described in the accompanying Management s
Assessment of Compliance , for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the
activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The Company has determined that none of these vendors is considered a
 servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the Servicing Criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors 
activities comply in all material respects with the Servicing Criterion applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible
for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related Servicing Criterion as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI
200.06. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied
with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iv) for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Board of Directors Synchrony Bank: 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance , that Synchrony Bank (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for
the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust and Synchrony Card Issuance Trust asset-backed securities transactions for which the
Company acted as servicer involving private label and co-branded credit card receivables (such asset-backed securities transactions,
the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it
performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As
described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance , Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(xiv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv) are only applicable for the following deals in the Platform (Synchrony Card
Issuance Trust, SynchronySeries Class A(2019-1) Notes, Synchrony Card Issuance Trust, SynchronySeries Class A(2019-2) Notes,
Synchrony Card Issuance Trust, SynchronySeries Class A(2022-1) Notes, and Synchrony Card Issuance Trust, SynchronySeries Class
A(2022-2) Notes). With respect to applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(xv), the Company has determined that there were no
activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix B to Management s Assessment of Compliance identifies
the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other

securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or
subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the
Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement.

Assessment of Compliance , for Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iv) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has
engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these Servicing Criteria. The Company has determined that none of these
vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the Servicing Criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that
Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively
the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset- backed securities issued on or after January 1,
2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities administration, paying agent or custodian services,
as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity
(the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this
report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform.
Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all
of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have
occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB,
there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities during the year ended December 31,
2022. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform
is fairly stated, in all material respects.
