 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), adopted pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based upon our good faith assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on our business. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: may, will, could, would, should, expect, intends, plans, strategy, prospects, anticipate, believe, approximately, estimate, predict, project, potential, continue, ongoing, or the negative of these terms or other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future events or future operating or financial performance, although the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. In particular, such statements include those relating to, among other things, (i) regulatory limitations on our products and services and the uncertainty in the application of federal, state, and local laws to our business, and any changes in such laws ; (ii) our ability to manufacture our products and product candidates on a commercial scale on our own or in collaboration with third parties; (iii) our ability to identify, consummate, and integrate anticipated acquisitions; (iv) general industry and economic conditions; (v) our ability to access adequate capital upon terms and conditions that are acceptable to us; (vi) our ability to pay interest and principal on outstanding debt when due; (vii) volatility in credit and market conditions; (viii) the loss of one or more key executives or other key employees; and (ix) other risks and uncertainties related to the cannabis market and our business strategy . This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual events or our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the future events, results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that future events, results, performance or achievements will be in accordance with our expectations or that the effect of future events, results, performance or achievements will be those anticipated by us. These forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Item 1. Business , Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. Considering these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this Report are reasonable, we cannot assure stockholders and potential investors that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Report and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.

 Risk Factors Summary Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should carefully review and consider the full discussion of our risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Set forth below is a summary list of the principal risk factors as of the date of the filing of this Report: We have incurred both losses and profits in prior periods and there is no assurance we can generate profits in the future; future losses could cause the quoted price of our Common Stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flow. We have a relatively short operating history, limited capitalization and limited funds available for operations, and we will require additional financing to successfully implement our business strategy. If we are unable to service or repay our indebtedness when due, the applicable lender may execute on the collateral. Our officers or directors may have conflicts of interest and some of our current officers have other interests outside of our business. We may be unable to attract or retain skilled labor and personnel with experience in the cannabis sector, obtain adequate equipment, parts, and components, and we may be unable to attract, develop, and retain additional employees required for our operations and future developments. We plan to expand our business and operations into jurisdictions outside of the current jurisdictions where we currently conduct business and doing so will expose us to new risks. We may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions or dispositions or to successfully manage the impacts of such transactions on our operations. Resources spent researching acquisitions that are not consummated could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire other businesses. Our sales are difficult to forecast, and changes in consumer spending may harm our business. We are subject to risks from product liability claims. Our business is dependent on regulatory licensing. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposure. Epidemics, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other health crises could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to execute our strategies and external market conditions could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact profitability. We are required to comply concurrently with various federal, state, and local laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, in each jurisdiction where we operate. Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, and our business is dependent on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. Competition in our industry is intense, and competition from synthetic production, technological advances, and the illicit cannabis market could impact our ability to succeed. Access to banking and other financial services is limited in the cannabis industry, and we are not always able to obtain quality services, favorable market rates, or financially advantageous opportunities as compared to businesses in other industries. Our success is dependent on consumer acceptance of cannabis products generally, and specifically of our products. We, or the cannabis industry more generally, may receive unfavorable publicity or become subject to negative consumer or investor perception. We are subject to risks related to unsafe concentration of heavy metals and other contaminants in our cannabis and nutrient products, and associated inconsistent treatment under state law.

 We are subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business, such as reliance on certain resources and utilities and the risk of crop failure. If we are unable to source raw materials in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, and at acceptable costs, our ability to manufacture and sell our products may be harmed. The scientific community has not yet extensively studied the long-term health effects of the use of vaporizer products, and there is uncertainty related to the regulation of vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories. Increased regulatory compliance burdens could have a material adverse impact on our business development efforts and our operations. The cannabis industry and market, which are relatively new in the United States, could face strong opposition from other industries, may not continue to exist or develop as anticipated, or we may ultimately be unable to succeed in the cannabis industry and market. We are unable to deduct all of our business expenses. Businesses involved in the cannabis industry are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to money laundering, financial recordkeeping, and proceeds of crimes. We could be subject to criminal prosecution or civil liabilities under RICO, and there is a risk of civil asset forfeiture of our assets. We may be unable to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts. We may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions, or develop strategic relationships by issuing securities that would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. Our Preferred Stock ranks senior to our Common Stock but junior to all of our existing and future liabilities in the event of a liquidation, winding up, or dissolution of our business. The market price for our Common Stock will be particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a limited operating history and lack of profits, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price, and there is no assurance that there will continue to be an active trading market for our Common Stock. Our stockholders may be unable to sell their Common Stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to such stockholders. FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our Common Stock, which could depress the price of our Common Stock. Because we hold a license to operate a cannabis business in Colorado and New Mexico, our stockholders may be required to make filings with the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division or the New Mexico Cannabis Control Division and we may be forced to redeem shares of our capital stock held by stockholders who are deemed unsuitable to be owners of our Company. Our Preferred Stock, our right to issue additional preferred stock, our classified Board of Directors, the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the concentration of board appointment rights with a few insiders may delay or prevent a take-over that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our management and principal stockholders could significantly influence or control matters requiring a stockholder vote, and other stockholders may not have the ability to influence corporate transactions. We are classified as a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock and other securities less attractive to investors. We have not paid dividends on our Common Stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation in the value of our Common Stock. We may be subject to risks related to our information technology systems, including the risk that we may be the subject of a cyber-attack and the risk that we may be in non-compliance with applicable privacy laws. We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property as a result of our participation in the cannabis industry.

In April 2020, the Company acquired its first plant-touching business, Mesa Organics Ltd. d/b/a Purplebee s Purplebee s ), which consisted of four dispensaries and one manufacturing infused products facility.

On February 8, 2022, the Company entered the New Mexico market with its acquisition of ten retail dispensaries located throughout the State of New Mexico operating under the banner R. Greenleaf, one manufacturing facility, and four cultivation facilities under the terms of a Purchase Agreement, dated November 29, 2021, with Nuevo Holding, LLC and Nuevo Elemental Holding, LLC, both of which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the Nuevo Purchasers ), Reynold Greenleaf Associates, LLC RGA ), Elemental Kitchen and Laboratories, LLC Elemental ), the equity holders of RGA and Elemental, and William N. Ford, in his capacity as Representative, as amended on February 8, 2022 (the Nuevo Purchase Agreement ). The Nuevo Purchasers acquired substantially all of the operating assets of RGA and all of the equity of Elemental and assumed specified liabilities of RGA and Elemental. Pursuant to existing laws and regulations in New Mexico, the cannabis licenses for certain facilities managed by RGA are held by two not-for-profit entities: Medzen Services, Inc. Medzen and R. Greenleaf Organics, Inc. R. Greenleaf and together with Medzen, the NFPs ). At the closing, Nuevo Holding, LLC gained control over the NFPs by becoming the sole member of each of the NFPs and replacing the directors of the two NFPs with the Company s Chief Executive Officer, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, and the Company s General Counsel. The business acquired from RGA consists of serving as a branding, marketing and consulting company, licensing certain intellectual property related to the business of THC-based products to Elemental and the NFPs, providing consulting services to Elemental and the NFPs, and supporting Elemental and the NFPs to promote, support, and develop sales and distribution of products. Elemental is engaged in the business of creating and distributing cannabis-derived products to licensed cannabis producers. Elemental and the NFPs are in the business of cultivating, processing and dispensing marijuana in New Mexico, with 10 dispensaries, four cultivation facilities (three operating and one under development) and one manufacturing facility. The dispensaries are located in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Roswell, Las Cruces, Grants and Las Vegas, New Mexico. The cultivation and manufacturing facilities are located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and consists of approximately 70,000 square feet of cultivation and 6,000 square feet of manufacturing. On the same date, Nuevo Holding, LLC entered into two separate Call Option Agreements containing substantially identical terms with each of the NFPs. Each Call Option Agreement gives Nuevo Holding, LLC the right to acquire 100 of the equity or 100 of the assets of the applicable NFP for a purchase price of 100 if, in the future, the New Mexico legislature adopts legislation that permits a NFP to (i) convert to a for-profit corporation and maintain its cannabis license or (ii) sell its assets (including its cannabis license) to a for-profit corporation. The aggregate closing consideration for the acquisitions was approximately (i) 32.2 million in cash, which included a 4.5 million cash earnout based on EBITDA of the acquired businesses for the calendar year 2021, and (ii) 17.0 million in the form of an unsecured promissory note issued by Nuevo Holding, LLC to RGA, the principal amount of which is payable on February 8, 2025 with interest payable monthly at an annual interest rate of 5 (the Nuevo Note ). On February 15, 2022, the Company acquired substantially all of the operating assets of Brow 2, LLC Brow related to its indoor cannabis cultivation operations located in Denver, Colorado (other than assets expressly excluded) and assumed certain liabilities for contracts acquired pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated August 20, 2021, among Double Brow, Brow, and Brian Welsh, as the owner of Brow (the Brow Purchase Agreement ). The acquired assets included a 37,000 square foot building, the associated lease and equipment designed for indoor cultivation. After purchase price adjustments for pre-closing inventory, the aggregate consideration was 6.7 million, of which Double Brow paid 6.2 million at closing and held back 500,000 as collateral for potential claims for indemnification under the Brow Purchase Agreement. Any of the purchase price held back and not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be released on February 15, 2023 plus 3 simple interest. On May 31, 2022, the Company acquired one retail dispensary operating under the banner Urban Dispensary and one cultivation facility, each located in Denver, Colorado, pursuant to an Asset and Personal Goodwill Purchase Agreement (the Urban Dispensary Purchase Agreement with Double Brow, Urban Health Wellness, Inc. d/b/a Urban Dispensary Urban Dispensary ), Productive Investments, LLC Productive Investments ), and Patrick Johnson (together with

 Productive Investments, the Urban Equityholders ), pursuant to which the Purchaser acquired (i) all of Urban Dispensary s assets used or held for use in Urban Dispensary s business of owning and operating a retail marijuana store and a grow facility, each located in Denver, Colorado, and (ii) all of Equityholders personal goodwill arising from Equityholders independent, separate, individual and personal efforts relating to Urban Dispensary s business on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the Urban Dispensary Purchase ), and assume obligations under contracts acquired as part of the Urban Dispensary Purchase. The aggregate consideration for the Urban Dispensary Purchase was 1.32 million in cash and 1,230,534 shares of Common Stock. The Company held back 288,000 of the stock consideration at closing as collateral for potential claims for indemnification from Urban Dispensary under the Urban Dispensary Purchase Agreement. Any portion of the held back consideration not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be released to Urban Dispensary on November 30, 2023. On July 13, 2022, the Company entered into a strategic relationship with Mission Holdings US, Inc. Mission Holdings ), an entity affiliated with MCG, by purchasing a non-controlling equity interest in Mission Holdings. Mission Holdings offers various cannabis products and brands, including proprietary cannabis-infused gummies and premium flower for medical and recreational sale in Colorado and California. The Company has the right to acquire 100 of the equity interest in Mission Holdings on or after the three-year anniversary of the investment. On December 15, 2022, the Company acquired substantially all of the operating assets associated with two retail dispensaries located in Denver, Colorado and Aurora, Colorado owned by Lightshade Labs LLC Lightshade pursuant to the terms of two Asset Purchase Agreements, dated September 9, 2022, among Double Brow, the Company, Lightshade, and Lightshade s owners, Thomas Van Alsburg, Steve Brooks, and John Fritzel, as amended on December 15, 2021 (the Lightshade Purchase Agreements . After purchase price adjustments for transaction and related expenses, the aggregate consideration for the acquisition was approximately 2.75 million, all of which was paid in cash. The Company deposited 300,000 of the purchase price in escrow as collateral for potential claims for indemnification from Lightshade under the Lightshade Purchase Agreements. Any of the purchase price placed in escrow and not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be released on December 15, 2023. Current Operations and Developments Operating Segments The Company s operations are organized into three different segments as follows: (i) Retail, consisting of retail locations for sale of cannabis products; (ii) Wholesale, consisting of manufacturing, cultivation and sale of both wholesale cannabis and non-cannabis products; and (iii) Other, consisting of all other income and expenses, which primarily includes those related to in-store advertising and general corporate operations. Each of our operating segments are discussed in further detail below. SEGMENT 1 Retail This segment currently includes our Retail dispensaries located in Colorado and New Mexico. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned and operated 25 retail cannabis dispensaries in the State of Colorado 19 retail dispensaries under the banner name Star Buds and six retail dispensaries under the banner name Emerald Fields and 16 retail cannabis dispensaries in the State of New Mexico, all under the banner name R. Greenleaf. Our dispensaries sell a wide variety of cannabis products directly to tens of thousands of consumers. These products include loose flower, concentrates, edibles, pre-rolls, topicals, infused beverages, and other associated cannabis products produced by a large variety of cannabis vendors. In Colorado, our retail dispensaries sell products sourced from our Wholesale segment, investment partners, licensing arrangements, and other third party suppliers. In New Mexico, our retail dispensaries sell products predominantly sourced through internal wholesale operations and a small percentage of third party products.

 SEGMENT 2 Wholesale This segment includes consolidated Wholesale, Cultivation, and Manufacturing. The Company supports its retail operations and growth through the operation of wholly-owned manufacturing and cultivation facilities. The Company s wholly-owned manufacturing and cultivation facilities also engage with the wholesale markets in Colorado and New Mexico. The Company s wholesale business includes cannabis and non-cannabis operations, although the Company s cannabis wholesale operations are more substantial than its non-cannabis activities. Wholesale The Company participates in the wholesale market through both its cultivation and manufacturing operations based on market conditions and internal needs. The wholesale cannabis market is influenced by a number of factors outside of the Company s control largely due to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry. The Company has acquired robust cultivation capacity such that it can expand production and sell its cultivation products to the wholesale market during certain market cycles when advantageous to do so, and it also has the ability to scale back production when the wholesale market is less profitable. The Company s manufacturing operations are used to extract oil from the cannabis plant and refine the oil into distillate oil. It sells this distillate oil to other product manufacturers. Like its cultivation facilities, the Company can increase or curtail its production capacity to adjust to market conditions. Lastly, the Company also supplies the wholesale markets through the sale of cannabis cultivation materials, nutrients, and equipment. The Company sells a variety of indoor gardening supplies and hydroponics through its online and retail store, The Big Tomato, located in Aurora, Colorado. While these wholesale activities were a meaningful component of the Company s operations in the past, the Company s business strategy has trended away from these revenue sources in recent years due to growth and expansion of the Company s retail, manufacturing, and cultivation activities as well as the impact of the greater wholesale market downturn in Colorado and nationwide. Management is assessing the ongoing value and anticipated future utilization of these particular wholesale operations. Cultivation As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned eight cultivation facilities: four in Colorado and four in New Mexico. The Company leverages its cultivating capacity in both states where it operates to participate in the wholesale market and/or support internal operations based on market conditions and profitability in wholesale transactions. The Company operated four active cultivations in Colorado throughout 2022, but it ceased operations at two of its facilities located in Denver, Colorado during the year to consolidate production activities and drive synergies. The Company maintains four active cultivation licenses in Colorado as of March 1, 2023. The Company s primary cultivation facilities in Colorado include (i) a 37,000 square foot building located in Denver, Colorado leased by the Company for indoor cultivation (the Brow Cultivation and (ii) 36 acres of land in Huerfano County, Colorado owned by the Company and designed for indoor and outdoor cultivation (the SCG Cultivation ). The SCG Cultivation includes a greenhouse and 24 hoop houses, and the Company is expanding the SCG Cultivation to include additional hoop houses for increased outdoor cultivation capacity. The Company operated four active indoor cultivations in New Mexico during 2022, and it discontinued operations at one of its cultivation facilities located in Albuquerque, New Mexico during 2022 to consolidate production activities and drive synergies. The Company maintains three active cultivation licenses in New Mexico as of March 1, 2023. The Company s primary cultivation facility in New Mexico is a 40,000 square foot building located in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the Edith Grow ). The Company completed the first phase of planned renovation of the Edith Grow in 2022 with the goal of completing additional phases of construction and renovation to expand the cultivation capacity of the Edith Grow for increased synergies and cost savings. The Edith Grow, together with the Company s other indoor

Table of Contents 
 cultivation facilities in New Mexico, primarily support Elemental s manufacturing operations and the New Mexico Retail segment operations. Manufacturing and Extraction As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned and operated two manufacturing facilities: one in Colorado and one in New Mexico. The Company s manufacturing facilities primarily conduct cannabis extraction, distillation, manufacturing, and infusion operations for incorporation into retail cannabis products or sale through internal and external channels. The Company purchases cannabis biomass and trim to support manufacturing operations both internally from its cultivation operations as well as from a number of different vendors across Colorado and New Mexico. The Company maintains the ability to strategically adjust the amount of materials sourced from internal and external sources based on market conditions due to vertical integration in both states. The Company s Colorado manufacturing facility is owned and operated by PBS. PBS leases a facility in Pueblo, Colorado containing approximately 7,000 square feet of space where PBS conducts ethanol extraction, distillation, and manufacturing of cannabis plants and biomass for sale and distribution to external buyers and internally to support the Company s retail segment. PBS also supports the Colorado Retail segment by processing and packaging products for retail distribution from time to time. The Company acquires cannabis biomass and trim to support PBS s manufacturing operations both internally from its cultivation operations at SCG and the Brow Cultivation as well as from a number of different vendors across Colorado. However, manufacturing operations in Colorado source raw materials from external vendors to a greater degree than manufacturing operations in New Mexico due to pricing and market conditions. PBS produces vapes, cartridges, and syringes for internal and external distribution, which includes the Company s proprietary brand of vape products: Purplebee s and Autograph by Purplebee s. The Company s New Mexico manufacturing facility is owned and operated by Elemental, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Elemental leases a manufacturing facility located in Albuquerque, New Mexico representing approximately 6,000 square feet where it performs extraction, infusion, and manufacturing operations. Elemental produces a number of cannabis products that are sold in R. Greenleaf dispensaries, including edibles and vapes. Elemental primarily sources the raw materials used for its operations through the Company s cultivation and wholesale operations due to increased vertical integration in New Mexico, although Elemental does purchase biomass and trim from external sources to support its operations. SEGMENT 3 Other This segment includes General Corporate and Other. General Corporate and Other The Other segment encompasses the Company s general corporate operations not otherwise categorized as retail or wholesale, and it also includes revenue from in-store advertisements and certain vendor promotions. This segment also includes the Company s research and development subsidiary, Schwazze Biosciences LLC, which is committed to pursuing a program of basic and applied research focused on bringing consumers, as well as pets, the most beneficial properties of the cannabis plant. Marketing The Company markets its products, retail establishments and services to consumers through a variety of channels, including: digital marketing efforts, print advertising, outdoor billboards, coupons, a consolidated loyalty program across all states and retail banners, ecommerce websites, budtender appreciation events, universal gift card program, search engine optimization activities, grand opening or newly remodeled store events, brand pop-up events, and in-store promotions. In 2022, the Company s Colorado retail banner, Star Buds, was the first cannabis sponsor of a professional ultimate frisbee sporting team, The Colorado Summit.

 Schwazze has created and maintains a database of marketing collateral materials and resources used for the Schwazze parent company brand, its in-house products/brands, and across all retail banners in the states in which it operates. The Company also coalesces interest and a presence within the industry through participation in various industry events, building relationships with key regulatory and government affairs officials, and through direct promotion. The Company continues to enhance its online presence via its house of brands website, http://www.schwazze.com, and its investor relations website, http://www.ir.schwazze.com . During 2022, the Company revamped its website to include an overview of its retail and wholesale brands, features on management and its Board of Directors, latest investor relations presentations, links to media, analyst coverage and press relations, Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports, and our industry partners. Intellectual Property, Brand Development, and Licensing Our operational success and business strategy incorporates various pieces of proprietary intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, and copyrights owned by the Company and licensing of third party intellectual property pursuant to licensing agreements. We also acknowledge that certain protections normally available to us related to design or other utility patents in the cannabis industry are not currently enforceable under federal law. We attempt to protect our intellectual property via the deployment of robust non-disclosure agreements with both prospective partners, employees, and licensees prior to engagement. We also register our owned intellectual property in the states where we operate in an effort to enhance protection against infringement. There are no assurances that these non-disclosure agreements will prevent a third party from infringing upon our rights, and we also cannot enforce our owned cannabis-related intellectual property outside of the states of Colorado and New Mexico where our marks are registered. We intend to register for federal patent and trademark protection that is otherwise currently prohibited if and when the federal government eliminates the cannabis prohibition. Schwazze is actively building a house of brands that includes both our active retail banners as well as products for sale at both the retail and wholesale level, manufacturing all products and controlling the quality for such brands through its vertical integration. The Company has developed three internally owned product brands as of March 1, 2023. These brands include: (i) Purplebee s and (ii) Autograph by Purplebee s, the Company s distillate vaporizer product line, and (iii) EDW (Every Day Weed), which is a pre-packaged pouch of loose-ground flower offered in half-ounce increments at an affordable price point. Purplebee s, Autograph by Purplebee s, and EDW are available for sale in Indica, Sativa and Hybrid strains. In addition to internal brand development efforts, we also enter into advantageous licensing agreements with other cannabis companies with recognizable brand value to maximize the success of our product offerings and sales. Schwazze has an exclusive licensing partnership with the premium California-based cannabis flower brand, Lowell Herb Company, which gives the Company exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and promote Lowell Farms products in the Colorado and New Mexico markets. Current products include: Quicks, Classics and Singles. Quicks and Classics are sold in 3.5g multi-units packs in blends of strains of indica, sativa, and hybrid dominances, while singles are 1g, single strain pre-rolls. The Lowell Farms brand is promoted through in-store advertising and promotion, customer loyalty programming, and budtender appreciation events. We also maintain a non-exclusive branding partnership with Mission Holdings pursuant to which we sell Mission Holdings proprietary brand of low-cost edibles, Nfuzed gummies, and premium flower, Level 10, in our retail channels in the states where we operate. We also acquired a number of brands through previous acquisitions of existing dispensaries with varying degrees of brand recognition and loyalty that we actively utilize in our house of brands. In connection with the Star Buds acquisitions, we acquired the exclusive right to use the Star Buds brand in Colorado pursuant to a licensing agreement with the owners of the Star Buds intellectual property. We also acquired all of the rights in and interest to the Emerald Fields intellectual property owned by MCG that was acquired pursuant to the MGC Merger Agreement. In Colorado, we currently operate all of our retail dispensaries under the Emerald Fields or Star Buds banner. In New Mexico, we acquired the intellectual property associated with R. Greenleaf and operate all existing dispensaries under the R. Greenleaf banner.

 Government Regulations Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently involved in the cannabis industry. The Company is directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, and distribution of cannabis in the adult-use cannabis marketplace in the State of Colorado and the State of New Mexico. Federal Regulations The United States federal government regulates drugs through the federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) (the CSA ), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in one of five different schedules. Cannabis, except hemp containing less than .3 (on a dry weight basis) of the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I drug. As a Schedule I drug, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency DEA considers cannabis to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. The classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug is inconsistent with what the Company believes to be many valuable medical uses for cannabis accepted by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. As evidence of this, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex (CBD) oral solution with an active ingredient derived from the cannabis plant for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from the cannabis plant. CBD is a chemical component of cannabis that does not contain the intoxication properties of THC THC ), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. The Company believes the CSA categorization as a Schedule I drug is not reflective of the medicinal properties of cannabis or the public perception thereof, and numerous studies show cannabis is not able to be abused in the same way as other Schedule I drugs, has medicinal properties, and can be safely administered. The federal position is also not necessarily consistent with democratic approval of cannabis at the state government level in the United States. Unlike in Canada, which has federal legislation uniformly governing the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, S.C. 2018, c. 16, (Canada) and the Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, cannabis is largely regulated at the state and local level in the United States. State laws regulating cannabis conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts. Although the Company s activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to federal criminal charges that may be brought against the Company. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution establishes that the United States Constitution and federal laws made pursuant to it are paramount and, in case of conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall apply. Nonetheless, 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have legalized some form of cannabis for medical use, while 21 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes. As more and more states legalized medical and/or adult-use cannabis, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal prohibition under the CSA and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, with cannabis listed as a Schedule I drug under the CSA. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal law enforcement agencies and banking institutions regarding cannabis through a series of memoranda from the Department of Justice DOJ ). The most recent such memorandum was drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (the Cole Memorandum ). The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding cannabis in all states, and acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states have enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis. The Cole Memorandum also noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to 
 9 

Table of Contents 
 control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. The Cole Memorandum was seen by many state-legal cannabis companies as a safe harbor for their licensed operations that were conducted in full compliance with all applicable state and local regulations. However, on January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. In the absence of a uniform federal policy, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys. Following his election, President Biden appointed Merrick Garland to serve as the U.S. Attorney General. While Attorney General Garland indicated in his confirmation hearing that he did not feel that enforcement of the federal cannabis prohibition against state-licensed business would be a priority target of the DOJ resources, no formal enforcement policy has been issued to date. There is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company abides by the following standard operating policies and procedures: 1. Ensure that its operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions; 2. Ensure that its cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements); 3. Implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors; 4. Implement policies and procedures to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs, or cartels; 5. Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across any state lines in general; 6. Ensure that its state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, is engaged in any other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and 7. Ensure that its products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. In addition, the Company conducts background checks to ensure that the principals and management of its operating subsidiaries are of good character, have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in cultivation, manufacturing, or distribution of cannabis. The Company will also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of its cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises, including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation. One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry remains in place: Congress has passed a so-called rider provision in the fiscal year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Acts to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The rider is known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment after its original lead sponsors (it is also sometimes referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer or Joyce-Leahy Amendment). In 2021, President Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment included. On February 18, 2022, the amendment was renewed through the signing of a stopgap spending bill, effective through March 11, 2022.

 Nevertheless, for the time being, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The federal government of the U.S. has always reserved the right to enforce federal law regarding the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis, even if state law sanctions such sale and disbursement. If the U.S. federal government begins to enforce U.S. federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing applicable state laws are repealed or curtailed, the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. There is a growing consensus among cannabis businesses and numerous members of Congress that prosecutorial discretion is not law and temporary legislative riders, such as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, are an inappropriate way to protect lawful medical cannabis businesses. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress in recent years to decriminalize aspects of state-legal cannabis trades. The Company has observed that each year more congressmen and congresswomen sign on and co-sponsor cannabis legalization bills. In light of all this, it is anticipated that the federal government will eventually repeal the federal prohibition on cannabis and thereby leave the states to decide for themselves whether to permit regulated cannabis cultivation, production, and sale, just as states are free today to decide policies governing the distribution of alcohol or tobacco. The most comprehensive proposal for reform of federal legislation on cannabis was introduced on July 14, 2021, by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) along with Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) when they released draft legislation titled the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (the CAOA ). The CAOA removes cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act which would permit its decriminalization and allow the expungement of federal non-violent marijuana crimes. The CAOA would impose a federal tax on cannabis of 10 in its first year of enactment, eventually increasing to 25 in 5 increments. The taxes raised would be used to petition fund programs to benefit communities disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs . The CAOA enshrines the current state cannabis licensing regimes but introduces additional federal permitting of cannabis wholesalers. Regulatory responsibility for cannabis control would be transferred from the DEA to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau TTB or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ATF ). The publication of the CAOA by Democratic congressional leaders represents a significant milestone in the move toward federal legalization of cannabis. While the CAOA indicates that legalization may come with significant federal tax burden, federal legalization will also bring long-awaited benefits to the industry of the removal of the Section 280E tax burden, clarity as to the status of state-licensed cannabis businesses, broad access to the banking and card payment system, and increased availability, and reduced cost, of capital. At the time of the CAOA announcement, Senator Schumer indicated the bill currently did not have sufficient support in the Congress to pass. Although he originally targeted Spring 2022 for passage of legislation based on the CAOA draft, he then shifted to introducing of a revised draft of the CAOA in the Senate in April 2022 . As introduced, the CAOA lacked clarity regarding the transition of cannabis control from the DEA to TTB and the FDA, which presents the risk that existing operators may face a period of regulatory uncertain if legislation similar to the CAOA is enacted. Such uncertainty may impede growth of, and investment in, incumbent cannabis businesses, while exposing them to increased competition from the illicit market. Ultimately, the CAOA did not pass and there can be no assurance that similar comprehensive legislation that would de-schedule cannabis and de-criminalize will be passed in the near future or at all. If such legislation is passed, there is no guarantee that it will include provisions that preserve the current state-based cannabis programs under which the Company s subsidiaries operate or that such legislation will be otherwise favorable to the Company and its business. Colorado Regulations On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. On November 6, 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which amended the state constitution to establish an adult use cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014 at cannabis businesses licensed

 under the regulatory framework. As of January 1, 2020, medical and adult use marijuana are regulated together under a single statute the Colorado Marijuana Code. Under the Colorado Marijuana Code, the Colorado Department of Revenue is empowered to grant licenses to both adult use and medical marijuana businesses, including cultivation facilities, products manufacturers, testing facilities, transporters, researchers and developers, and (in the adult use context) accelerator cultivators, accelerator stores, and hospitality businesses. Cannabis businesses must also comply with local licensing requirements. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana businesses. The Company in Colorado is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Colorado. Colorado License Requirements An application for a marijuana business in Colorado requires submission of (1) a copy of any local license required for the marijuana business, (2) a certificate of good standing from the jurisdiction in which the business was formed, (3) the identity and address of the registered agent in Colorado, (4) organizational documents such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, articles of organization, and similar documents, (5) corporate governance documents, (6) a deed, lease, or similar document establishing the applicant s ability to use the proposed premises, (7) a facility diagram, (8) findings of suitability with respect to the business owners, (8) information regarding securities listings (if the business is publicly traded), (9) financial statements, and documents related to payments of taxes. A business is required to obtain permission from its locality as part of the licensing process. With respect to the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, the Company has no reason to believe it wouldn t receive an applicable renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business. Regulatory Requirements The regulations establish requirements applicable to all marijuana businesses, along with specific requirements for each type of business. All marijuana businesses in Colorado are required to (1) create and enforce limited access areas for the protection of marijuana and marijuana products, (2) maintain security alarm systems installed and maintained by a licensed alarm installation company, as well as approved locks and surveillance equipment, (3) follow all applicable laws regarding waste disposal (including cannabis-containing waste), (4) implement an inventory tracking system used for inventory tracking and recordkeeping, (5) comply with both state and local requirements as to hours of operation, (6) comply with sanitary requirements applicable to employees and production spaces, including sanitation audits, (7) comply with recordkeeping requirements, and (8) maintain and provide procedures for dealing with product recalls. Cultivation facilities are additionally required to (1) provide and maintain copies of standard operating procedures for cultivation, harvesting, drying, curing, trimming, packaging, storing, and sampling, (2) comply with requirements related to pesticides, and (3) comply with additional sanitary and product safety requirements. Marijuana products manufacturers are required to (1) comply with labeling and dosing requirements related to standardized doses of marijuana, (2) comply with specific prohibitions regarding the shapes, colors, and similar characteristics of edible products, refrain from use of prohibited additives and ingredients, (3) maintain and provide standard operating procedures related to manufacturing of each category of products. Marijuana dispensaries are subject to additional requirements regarding (1) methods of accepting orders, (2) payments by customers, and (3) identification of customers. The Marijuana Enforcement Division and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to

 inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present. Colorado uses METRC as the Marijuana Enforcement Division s marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities. New Mexico Until 2021, New Mexico s cannabis industry was regulated under the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act (the LECUA ), which permitted and regulated the use of cannabis for qualified and registered patients with certain medical conditions. The LECUA was administrated by the New Mexico Department of Health. On April 12, 2021, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Cannabis Regulation Act, which became effective on June 29, 2021 (the CRA ). The CRA decriminalized the possession, use and cultivation of cannabis for recreational or adult use and created the Cannabis Control Division (the CCD as a new division of the New Mexico Regulation Licensing Department, to administer the CRA and promulgate, by or before January 1, 2022, a single set of rules for regulation of the State s medical and adult use cannabis industry, including licensure, sales, testing, security, advertising and labeling of cannabis products. Other than maintenance of the patient registry for medical cannabis under the LECUA, the CRA vested CCD with all authority to administrate and regulate New Mexico s medical and adult use cannabis activities. Consequently, parties licensed pursuant to the CCD rules can sell both medical and adult use cannabis with the most substantive differences being: (i) medical cannabis is not subject to the New Mexico Cannabis Excise Tax; (ii) persons under 21 can only legally purchase cannabis products if they are a qualified medical patient; and (iii) the CCD has the authority to effectively reserve some cannabis to ensure an adequate supply for medical patients. The CRA permits local jurisdictions to adopt reasonable time, place and manner rules that do not conflict with the CRA, but such rules must not completely prohibit operation of an entity licensed under the CRA or impose criminal, civil or administrative penalties on any such licensee for the use of a property licensed by the CCD. The CRA provides for the following types of licenses: courier, testing laboratory, manufacturer, producer, retailer, research laboratory, vertically integrated, producer microbusiness, integrated microbusiness and cannabis consumption area. The CRA does not create a limit on the number of licenses issued but does limit the number of plants that can be grown under each producer license and requires as a condition of licensure that each producer applicant demonstrate the legal right to enough water for its proposed operation as determined by the CCD and validated by documents from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer. Per the CRA s express requirement, retail sales of adult use cannabis products in New Mexico began on April 1, 2022. In January and March of 2022, the CCD amended its rules to increase plant counts for most license types and modified the testing requirements for cannabis products. Since April 1, 2022, there have been no substantive changes in New Mexico s regulatory framework. The Company is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New Mexico. Any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company s licensing, business activities or operations are required by Staff Notice 51-352 to be promptly disclosed by the Company. New Mexico Licensing Requirements In New Mexico, licenses are renewed annually. In order to operate in New Mexico an operator is required to obtain a license from the CCD, a certificate of occupancy from the applicable local government and a certificate of fitness from the State Fire Marshall. Each year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by CCD. While renewals are annual, there is no limit to the number of renewals a licensee may obtain. Assuming requisite renewal fees are paid, renewal applications are submitted in a timely manner, and the establishment has not

 been cited for material violations, renewal applicants can anticipate approval in the ordinary course of business. However, any unexpected denials, delays or costs associated with a licensing renewal could impede planned operations and may have a material adverse effect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. A vertically integrated cannabis establishment license permits the holder to conduct one or more of the following: (i) production of cannabis, (ii) manufacturing of cannabis products, (iii) retail establishment, or (iv) courier of cannabis products. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual older than 21 years of age who does not possess a physician s recommendation. Holders of licenses in New Mexico are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, sales, manufacturing standards, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, records and reporting, and more. Any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company s licensing, business activities or operations are required by Staff Notice 51-352 to be promptly disclosed by the Company. Cannabis Production Requirements A producer license permits the holder to cultivate cannabis, including planting, growing and harvesting cannabis. A licensee must submit to the CCD a premises diagram that shows the location of all entrances, exits, rooms, cultivation areas, light locations, and security camera locations, among other things. A producer must develop and implement policies and procedures that include, at a minimum, cannabis testing criteria and procedures consistent with the CRA, employee training materials, training requirements, recordkeeping protocols, transportation, testing protocols, employee policies and procedures. Licensees must also develop a cultivation plan that details, among other things, the cultivation areas, water usage, pesticide storage areas, processing areas, packaging areas, a light diagram, if applicable, pest management and cannabis waste procedures. A producer must follow stringent health and safety requirements that cover premises, equipment and employees. The use of pesticides is permitted so long as they are used in accordance with the New Mexico Pesticide Control Act. Manufacturing Requirements There are four classes of manufacturing licenses: 8. Class I: A licensee that only packages or repackages cannabis products, or labels or relabels the cannabis product container. 9. Class II: A licensee that conducts Class I activities and manufactures edible products or topical products using infusion processes, or other types of cannabis products other than extracts or concentrates, and does not conduct extractions. 10. Class III: A licensee that conducts Class I and Class II activities and extracts using mechanical methods or non-volatile solvents. 11. Class IV: A licensee that conducts Class I, Class II and Class III activities and extracts using volatile solvents or supercritical CO2. A manufacturing license permits the holder to manufacture cannabis in accordance with the Class of a license held. A licensee must submit to the CCD a premises diagram that shows the location of all entrances, exits, rooms, cultivation areas, light locations, security camera locations, among other things. A manufacturer must develop and implement policies and procedures that include, at a minimum cannabis testing criteria and procedures consistent with the CRA, employee training materials, training requirements, recordkeeping protocols, transportation, testing protocols, employee policies and procedures and training documentation. The CCD sets forth requirements regarding purity and materials used and requires all extractions to be performed in a closed loop system.

 Retail Requirements Adult use retailed licenses permit the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older or to any individual 18 years of age or older if such person possesses a valid qualified patient, primary caregiver or reciprocal participant registry card. As with all state-legal cannabis programs, only cannabis grown in New Mexico can be sold in New Mexico. Cannabis retailers may only display cannabis goods for inspection and sale in the retail area. Such goods may be removed from their packaging and placed in containers to allow for customer inspection, so long as the containers are not readily accessible to customers without the assistance of retailer personnel. A container must be provided to the customer by the licensed retailer or its employees, who must remain with the customer at all times that the container is being inspected by the customer. Cannabis goods removed from their packaging in this way may not be sold or consumed. They must be destroyed appropriately when they are no longer being used for display. Retailers may also sell live, immature cannabis plants and seeds. A retailer may not sell more than two ounces of cannabis, sixteen grams of cannabis extract, eight hundred milligrams of edible cannabis, or six immature cannabis plants to a customer in a single purchase. Courier Requirements A licensee may deliver cannabis products directly to a qualified patient who is at least 18 years of age, a primary caregiver or a reciprocal participant, or directly to a consumer who is at least 21 years of age. Payment for cannabis and cannabis products cannot be requested or received by a cannabis courier. Licensees may only deliver cannabis products to the person who is identified by the retail cannabis licensee as an intended, authorized recipient. Licensees must obtain cannabis from a licensed retailer and the courier must be employed by the retailer or have established a delivery agreement. Licensees must also comply with any local laws restricting time of deliveries and can only be delivered to a residential address. Reporting Requirements New Mexico uses BioTrackTHC BioTrack as the state s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all sate-issued annual licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to BioTrack. Storage, Transportation and Security Requirements To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, the CCD requires licensed businesses to do the following: 
 maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day; maintain a fully operational security alarm system; ensure that the facility s outdoor premises have sufficient lighting; not dispense from its premises outside of permissible hours of operation; store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault; report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion or loss of cannabis; and ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities and maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products. In addition to CCD storage and security requirements, local jurisdictions may have additional storage and security requirements. Such requirements, to the extent they exist, may vary from one locality to another.

 Site Visits and Inspections The CCD and its authorized representatives have broad authority, with or without notice, to inspect licensed cannabis operations, including premises, facilities, equipment, books and records (which may be copied, and such copies retained) and cannabis products. In addition, a licensed producer must submit annual reports to the CCD on inventory, sales, revenue, and other matters. Failure to grant representatives from CCD full and immediate access to facilities, property and premises, or to cooperate with inspections and investigations, may result in disciplinary action and referral to law enforcement. Any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company s licensing, business activities or operations are required by Staff Notice 51-352 to be promptly disclosed by the Company Compliance Activities Despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company continues to do the following towards ensuring compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Guidance, and other best industry practices: The Company and its subsidiaries operate in compliance with licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. The Company s cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, products are sold only to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis. The Company performs due diligence on contractors or anyone provided access to secure areas of its facilities to prevent products from being distributed to minors. The Company works to ensure that the licensed operators have an adequate inventory tracking system and adequate procedures in place so that its compliance system can track inventory effectively. This is done so that there is no diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across state lines in general. The Company conducts background checks as required by applicable state law. The Company conducts reviews of activities of the cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of its licensed premises (including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation e.g. transfer of products between licensed premises). These reviews are completed to ensure that licensed operators do not possess or use cannabis on federal property or engage in manufacturing or cultivation of cannabis on federal lands. The Company s product packaging complies with applicable regulations and contains necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. In addition, the Company ensures compliance with its obligations under New Mexico law and regulations by (i) engaging third-party cannabis monitoring services who provide legislative monitoring and regulatory compliance services, and (ii) periodic reviews with external counsel who audit compliance checks on the Company s suppliers and other industry partners to ensure their ongoing compliance and ensure that the Company s internal processes are sufficient to maintain with its obligations under New Mexico law. Employees and Human Capital As of March 1, 2023, the Company employed 651 full time and 93 part time employees across all reporting segments, and the Company expects its labor demand to increase as it continues to expand operations in Colorado and New Mexico and into potential new markets in the future. The Company also employs several specialty contractors to provide support for various roles in retail sales, wholesale, cultivation, and distribution operations and general corporate roles. The Company intermittently engages temporary staffing agencies to fill labor demand during peak times in the Company s cultivation and harvest cycle. Full time employees are distributed among several departments, including retail, cultivation,

Table of Contents 
 manufacturing, integration and operations, construction and project management, supply chain and distribution, facilities and security, information technology, sales and marketing, human resources, finance, mergers, acquisitions and real estate, regulatory licensing and compliance, and legal. The Company offers company-sponsored benefits packages to all eligible full-time employees, which includes participation in a 401(k) retirement savings plan (for which full-time and part-time employees are both eligible), medical, vision, and dental plans, disability insurance, employee assistance programs, life insurance, and other voluntary benefits such as accident insurance, hospital indemnity, critical illness coverage, and pet insurance. None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. Management currently evaluates employee performance-based on financial metrics such as EBITDA, revenue, and free cash flow, along with specific individual performance goals for certain roles, to assess and reward employee performance. The Company is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining qualified, hard-working individuals to contribute to a diverse and successful culture. During 2022, the Company expanded its team dedicated to human capital needs for more direct engagement with its employees and the labor needs of the organization, specifically hiring a Head of Human Resources in May 2022 and further expanding its human resources function through deployment of various resources throughout the organization. The Company engages with its employees to evaluate overall satisfaction and culture through anonymous surveys and interviews, the results of which are aggregated and compiled into action plans designed to address pressure points in its workforce. The Company anticipates implementing additional policies in future periods to further its efforts to attract and retain qualified talent across the organization. Environmental, Social, and Governance The Company strives to be an exemplary steward for the cannabis industry in the markets in which it operates, and the Company is committed to its contribution to a more equitable and sustainable industry. The cannabis industry experiences a higher degree of organic diversity than is often common in other industries, and the Company seeks to capitalize on this unique characteristic to build a more diverse workforce to foster new ideas and innovation within the cannabis community. The Company seeks to hire diverse talent at every level in the organization, including management. The Company adopted a diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy in 2022 for implementation in 2023 that seeks to attract and support a diverse workforce. The Company believes that strong governance and processes are key to maximizing operational synergies and success while managing and minimizing risk. Management incorporates automation and organizational checks and balances in its corporate processes to manage human resources, and it maintains good communication with the Company s board of directors. Management meets regularly with a subset of directors of the Company to discuss acquisition activity and strategy, and the Company appointed Jonathan Berger as Lead Independent Director of the Company s board of directors to strengthen its governance position. The cannabis industry is dependent on certain resources such as water and electricity to succeed. The Company strives to achieve efficient and sustainable practices so as to conserve these resources. The cost of these resources, and the cost of compliance with expanding environmental regulations, could increase in the future. COVID-19 and Future Pandemics In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized coronavirus disease 2019 (together with its variants COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the U.S. and other countries across the world, and the duration and severity of its effects and those of its variants are currently unknown. The Company remains committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees and customers in accordance with recommended actions of the government and health authorities as COVID-19 persists. In the future, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or an unrelated pandemic illness may present similar or unique operational challenges faced by the Company during the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to labor shortages, supply chain disruption, travel and work restrictions, and recessionary macroeconomic conditions impacting consumer behavior.

 The Company s financial results of operations were not materially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the year-ended December 31, 2022. However, the uncertain nature of the spread of COVID-19 and any future pandemics may impact the Company s business operations in future periods. Competition As discussed above, our business has recently expanded. In addition to operational expansions in Colorado, we also entered the New Mexico market in 2022. With expansion in existing and new markets and operational developments, our competition has also increased. As a multi-state operator MSO with vertically integrated operations, we compete with a variety of other operators for market share, including other regional MSOs, single store operators, consumer packaged goods companies, cultivators, illicit market participants, and potentially pharmaceutical companies in the future. In the majority of states that have legalized adult-use cannabis sales, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. There are not state-wide license caps prescribed by state law in Colorado and New Mexico where we currently operate; however, some local jurisdictions place caps, outright prohibition, and/or restrictions on new license issuances, which can add additional complexity and practical barriers to our expansion efforts in certain geographic areas. As of December 31, 2022, there were 669 recreational cannabis licenses issued in Colorado, up from 651 recreational cannabis licenses issued as of December 31, 2021, meaning approximately 18 recreational cannabis licenses were issued in 2022 (which does not account for licenses surrendered or terminated throughout the year). Our most direct competitors within Colorado include The Green Solution, Native Roots, Green Dragon, LivWell, Columbia Care Inc., Craft Concentrates, Mammoth Manufacturing, Colorado Cannabis Company, and Spherex Inc. In New Mexico, there were 200 cannabis licenses as of December 31, 2021, which increased to 550 cannabis licenses as of December 31, 2022. Our most direct competitors within New Mexico include Ultra Health, PurLife, Pecos Valley, Assurance, Everest, and Bloom. Outside of Colorado and New Mexico, we also view other vertically integrated MSOs as potential competitors due to our growth and future plans; these competitors include Green Thumb Industries, Inc., iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc., Acreage Holdings, Inc., and Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. Like us, these companies can realize centralized synergies to produce higher margins. Additionally, we compete with the illicit markets. The New Mexico market presents more competition from illicit participants as compared to the Colorado market due to the infancy of the cannabis industry in that state as well as fewer caps and restrictions on new license issuances. As the regulatory environment continues to develop in Colorado, New Mexico, and nationwide, management believes there will be a meaningful reduction of the illicit market. Industry Analysis Nationally, the marijuana industry has continued to expand through the passage of legislation in many states permitting medical and/or recreational use of cannabis under state law. While there certainly appears to be a trend towards acceptance of cannabis on a state-by-state basis, there are no assurances offered that this business will be able to sustain itself over time if the Federal government changes its current position related to state legalized operations. As of March 1, 2023 at least 38 states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam have legalized marijuana for medical use. Twenty-one of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized the adult-use of cannabis. Sales in the Colorado market decreased in 2022 following two years of strong growth. The Colorado market dropped 21 from 2.23 billion in gross sales during 2021 to 1.77 billion in gross sales during 2022. The New Mexico market showed strong growth in 2022 following legalization of adult-use cannabis sales starting on April 1, 2022. According to BDSA, the leading provider of market intelligence for the cannabis industry, the New Mexico market generated approximately

Recent Developments The Company previously reported that it signed an agreement on January 25, 2023 with Cannabis Care Wellness Centers, LLC and Green Medicals Wellness Center #5, LLC (collectively referred to as Smokey s and the owners of Smokey s, pursuant to which the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, will purchase two retail and medical marijuana stores located in Fort Collins, Colorado and Garden City, Colorado. The aggregate consideration for the Smokey s acquisition will be up to 7.5 million, payable in cash and Common Stock. At the closing, the Company will pay the purchase price (i) in cash in the amount of 3,750,000 and (ii) in shares of the Common Stock in the amount of 3,150,000 divided by the price per share of the Common Stock as of market close on the first trading day immediately before the closing. At the closing, the Company will use a portion of the purchase price to pay off certain indebtedness and transaction expenses of Smokey s and then pay the balance to Smokey s. The Company will hold back from issuance additional shares of Common Stock in the amount of 600,000 divided by the price per share of the Common Stock as of market close on the first trading day immediately before the closing and 150,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price as collateral for potential claims for indemnification from Smokey s under the purchase agreement. Any portion of the indemnity holdback not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be issued or released (as applicable) to the owners of Smokey s on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition in accordance with the purchase agreement. The cash portion of the indemnity holdback is also subject to post-closing reduction if any of the actual marijuana inventory or cash at closing is less than certain targets stated in the purchase agreement. The closing of the Smokey s acquisition is subject to closing conditions customary for a transaction of this nature, including, without limitation, obtaining licensing approval from the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division and local regulatory authorities. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. There are a number of risk factors affecting the Company, its business and holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. The risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that the Company does not know about now or that it currently deems immaterial, may also adversely affect the Company s business. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company s business may be harmed and its financial condition and results of operations may suffer significantly. Risks Related to Our Industry Cannabis remains illegal under federal law. Despite the successful development of a cannabis industry legal under state laws in a number of states, state laws legalizing medicinal and recreational adult cannabis use are in conflict with the CSA, which classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance and makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes, and thus federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws legalizing its use. A prior U.S. administration attempted to address the inconsistent treatment of cannabis under state and federal law in the Cole Memorandum, which Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. Attorneys in August 2013 that outlined certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum provided that enforcing federal cannabis laws and regulations in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations was not a priority for the DOJ. The DOJ did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum. On January 4, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally issued the Sessions Memorandum, which rescinded the Cole Memorandum effective upon its issuance. The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects Congress determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime, and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. There can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. The Biden administration has not expressed a cannabis policy as of the date of this Report. The uncertainty of federal enforcement practices going forward and the inconsistency between federal and state laws and regulations presents major risks for our business and operations. Any such change in the federal government s enforcement of federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our stockholders. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis is illegal. It is also federally illegal to advertise the sale of cannabis, or to sell paraphernalia designed or intended primarily for use with cannabis, unless the paraphernalia is authorized by federal, state, or local law. Our business involves the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis and cannabis products, and, therefore, violates federal law. Further, we provide services to customers that are engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation and/or transfer of cannabis. As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, may seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited to, a claim of aiding and abetting another s criminal activities. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who commits an offense against the United States or aides, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. 18 U.S.C. 2(a). If the Federal Government were to change its enforcement practices, or were to expend its resources enforcing existing federal laws on those involved in the cannabis industry, such action could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations, our customers or the sales of our products up to and including a complete cessation of our business, and our investors could lose their entire investment. It is possible that additional federal or state legislation could be enacted in the future that would prohibit us from selling cannabis, and if such legislation were enacted, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease, causing revenues to decline. Further, additional government disruption in the cannabis industry could cause potential customers and users to be reluctant to use our products and services, which would be detrimental to us. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. Our business is dependent on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. While there appears to be ample public support for legislative action to legalize cannabis use and possession, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states in which we have business interests. Any one of these factors could slow or halt the use of cannabis, which would negatively impact our business up to possibly causing us to discontinue operations as a whole. The voters or legislatures of states in which cannabis has already been legalized could potentially repeal applicable laws that permit the operation of both medical and retail cannabis businesses. These actions might force businesses, including our own, to cease operations in one or more states entirely.

 We are required to comply concurrently with federal, state and local laws in each jurisdiction where we operate. Various federal, state and local laws, regulations and guidelines govern our business in the jurisdictions in which we operate or propose to operate, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, conduct of operations and the production, management, transportation, storage and disposal of our products and of certain material used in our operations. Compliance with each of these laws, regulations and guidelines requires concurrent compliance with other complex federal, state and local laws, regulations and guidelines. These laws, regulations and guidelines change frequently and may be difficult to interpret and apply. Compliance with these laws, regulations and guidelines requires the investment of significant financial and managerial resources, and a determination that we are not in compliance with these laws, regulations and guidelines could harm our reputation and brand image and have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, it is impossible for us to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations or guidelines upon our future operations. Changes to these laws, regulations and guidelines could negatively affect our competitive position within our industry and the markets in which we operate, and there is no assurance that various levels of government in the jurisdictions in which we operate will not pass legislation or regulation or issue guidelines that adversely impacts our business. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. We are subject to a variety of state and federal laws in the United States. In the United States, despite cannabis having been legalized for medical use in many states, and for adult recreational use in a number of states, cannabis meeting the definition of marijuana continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Following the passage of HB19-1090 in Colorado, we have elected to move into plant-touching operations in addition to non-plant-touching operations by acquiring several plant-touching businesses in Colorado and New Mexico. As a public company involved in direct plant-touching activities, we may face additional scrutiny from the U.S. federal government or other regulatory agencies. Such scrutiny, and any investigation of our operations related to plant-touching activities, could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition in our industry is intense. The cannabis industry is highly fragmented, and we have many competitors, including many who offer similar products and services as those offered by us. There can be no guarantees that other companies will not enter the market and develop products and services that are in direct competition with us in the future. We anticipate continued competition from current participants as well as entry of other companies in the cannabis market, and we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage. Some of these companies may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, preferable product offerings, and/or significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. This may allow them to respond more quickly than us to market opportunities. It may also allow them to devote greater resources to the marketing, promotion and sale of their products and services. These competitors may also adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential customers, employees, strategic partners, distribution channels and advertisers. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and potential loss of market share. Competition from the illicit cannabis market could impact our ability to succeed. We face competition from illegal market operators that are unlicensed and unregulated including illegal dispensaries and illicit market suppliers selling cannabis and cannabis-based products. As these illegal market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry, their operations may have significantly lower costs. The perpetuation of the illegal market for cannabis may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, as well as the perception of cannabis use. Furthermore, given the restrictions on regulated cannabis retail, it is possible that legal cannabis consumers revert to the illicit market as a matter of convenience.

 We are subject to risks related to unsafe concentration of heavy metals and other contaminants in our cannabis and nutrient products, and associated inconsistent treatment under state law. Cannabis plants may absorb heavy metals and other contaminants from the soil that they grow in. Nutrient products are made from ingredients that may contain heavy metals and other contaminants. Heavy metals and contaminants are naturally found in the earth s soil but may also be present as a result of pesticide use. Some contaminants, like heavy metals, are toxic to humans at even low concentrations. If our raw materials contain contaminants, they may transfer to our products. If the level of contaminants in our products exceeds permissible or safe levels, it may result in loss of inventory and possible harm to consumers of the products, which may expose us, among other things, to monetary losses, product liability claims and reputational risk. In addition, state regulation of testing for, and permissible levels of, contaminants in cannabis products varies, making compliance costly. We face competition from synthetic production and technological advances. The pharmaceutical and hemp industries may attempt to dominate the cannabis industry through the development and distribution of synthetic products which emulate the effects and treatment of organic cannabis. If they are successful, the widespread popularity of such synthetic products could change the demand, volume and profitability of the cannabis industry. This could adversely affect our ability to secure long-term profitability and success through the sustainable and profitable operation of our business. Our success is dependent on consumer acceptance of cannabis products generally, and specifically our products. Our ability to generate revenue and be successful in the implementation of our business plan is significantly dependent on consumer acceptance of and demand for cannabis products generally, and, specifically, our products. Consumer acceptance will depend on several factors, including federal, state, and local regulation of cannabis as well as availability, cost, ease of use, familiarity of use, convenience, effectiveness, quality, safety, and reliability of cannabis products. If consumers do not accept cannabis products generally, or, specifically, our products, or if we fail to meet customers needs and expectations, our ability to continue generating revenues could be reduced. We are subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business such as reliance on certain resources and the risk of crop failure. We work in the cannabis industry, which relies on agricultural processes. The cultivation of cannabis plants requires large amounts of resources like water and electricity for a successful harvest. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these resources at affordable prices, whether by reason of climate change, political forces, civil unrest, market conditions, weather events, pandemic outbreaks, or other forces beyond our control, our operations and financial condition could be materially impacted. Our business is also subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, including risks of crop failure presented by weather, insects, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks that might affect our operations and profitability. Additionally, during the harvest season, cannabis plant prices often decrease and reduce gross margins, which tends to impact our liquidity and results of operations depending on the severity of such price fluctuations. There is uncertainty related to the regulation of vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories. Increased regulatory compliance burdens could have a material adverse impact on our business development efforts and our operations. There is uncertainty regarding whether and in what circumstances federal, state, or local regulatory authorities will seek to develop and enforce regulations relative to vaporizer hardware and accessories that can be used to vaporize cannabis and/or tobacco. Further, it remains to be seen whether current or future regulations relating to tobacco vaporization products would also apply to cannabis vaporization products and related consumption accessories.

 There has been increasing activity on the federal, state, and local levels with respect to scrutiny of vaporizer products. Federal, state, and local governmental bodies across the United States have indicated that vaporization products and certain other consumption accessories may become subject to new laws and regulations at the state and local levels. For example, in September 2019, the Trump Administration announced a plan to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes nationwide. At the state level, over 25 states have implemented statewide regulations that prohibit vaping in public places. In January 2015, the California Department of Health declared electronic cigarettes and certain other vaporizer products a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products, and in September 2019, California s governor issued an executive order on vaping, focused on enforcement and disclosure. Many states, provinces, and some cities have passed laws restricting the sale of electronic cigarettes and certain other tobacco vaporizer products. Some cities have also implemented more restrictive measures than their state counterparts, such as San Francisco, which in June 2018, approved a new ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including vaping liquids and menthol cigarettes. The application of any new laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, at a federal, state, or local level, directly or indirectly implicating cannabis vaporization products or consumption accessories could limit our ability to sell such products, result in additional compliance expenses, and require us to change our labeling and methods of distribution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations. The scientific community has not yet extensively studied the long-term health effects of the use of vaporizer products. Cannabis vaporizers and related products were recently developed and therefore the scientific community has not had a sufficient period of time to study the long-term health effects of their use. If the scientific community were to determine conclusively that use of any or all of these products poses long-term health risks, market demand for these products and their use could materially decline. Such a determination could also lead to litigation and significant regulation. Loss of demand for our product, product liability claims, and increased regulation stemming from unfavorable scientific studies of these products could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. The cannabis industry and market are relatively new in the United States, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or develop as anticipated or we may ultimately be unable to succeed in this industry and market. We are operating our current business in the relatively new cannabis industry and market, and our success depends on our ability to operate our business successfully. In addition to being subject to general business risks applicable to a business involving an agricultural product and a regulated consumer product, we need to continue to build brand awareness of our brand in the cannabis industry and make significant investments in our business strategy and production capacity. These investments include introducing new products and services into the markets in which we operate, adopting quality assurance protocols and procedures and undertaking regulatory compliance efforts. These activities may not promote our business as effectively as intended, or at all, and we expect that our competitors will undertake similar investments to compete with us for market share. Competitive conditions, consumer preferences and spending patterns in this industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique characteristics that differ from other existing industries and markets and that may cause our efforts to further our business to be unsuccessful or to have undesired consequences. As a result, we may not be successful in our efforts to operate our business or to develop new products and services and produce and distribute these products and services to the markets in which we operate in time to be effectively commercialized, or these activities may require significantly more resources than we currently anticipate in order to be successful. We, or the cannabis industry more generally, may receive unfavorable publicity or become subject to negative consumer or investor perception. We believe that the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon positive consumer and investor perception regarding the benefits, safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis distributed to consumers. The perception of the cannabis industry and cannabis products, currently and in the future, may be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, political statements, media attention and other publicity (whether or not accurate or with merit) both in the United States and in other countries relating to the consumption of cannabis products, including unexpected safety or efficacy concerns arising with respect to cannabis products or the activities of industry participants. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 findings or publicity will be favorable to the cannabis market or any particular cannabis product or will be consistent with earlier publicity. Adverse future scientific research reports, findings and regulatory proceedings that are, or litigation, media attention or other publicity that is, perceived as less favorable than, or that questions, earlier research reports, findings or publicity (whether or not accurate or with merit) could result in a significant reduction in the demand for our cannabis products, which would affect our business. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of cannabis or our products specifically, or associating the consumption of cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could adversely affect us. This adverse publicity could arise even if the adverse effects associated with cannabis products resulted from consumers failure to use such products legally, appropriately or as directed. Certain events or developments in the cannabis industry more generally may impact our reputation. Damage to our reputation can result from the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including any negative publicity, whether true or not. As we are producers and distributors of cannabis, which is a controlled substance in the United States that has previously been commonly associated with various other narcotics, violence and criminal activities, there is a risk that our business might attract negative publicity. There is also a risk that the actions of other companies and service providers in the cannabis industry may negatively affect the reputation of the industry as a whole and thereby negatively impact our reputation. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate, publish and discuss user generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share negative opinions and views in regards to our activities and the cannabis industry in general, whether true or not. We do not ultimately have direct control over how we or the cannabis industry are perceived by others. Reputational issues may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations, and present an impediment to our overall ability to advance our business strategy and realize growth. We are unable to deduct all of our business expenses. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing us to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a cannabis business depends on how large its ratio of nondeductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, our cannabis business may be less profitable than it would be if we were able to deduct our ordinary and necessary business expenses similar to other businesses. The cannabis industry could face strong opposition from other industries. We believe that established businesses in other industries may have a strong economic interest in opposing the development of the cannabis industry. Cannabis may be seen by companies in other industries as an attractive alternative to their products, including recreational cannabis as an alternative to alcohol and medical cannabis as an alternative to various commercial pharmaceuticals. Many industries that could view the emerging cannabis industry as an economic threat are well established, with vast economic and federal and state lobbying resources. It is possible that companies within these industries could use their resources to attempt to slow or reverse legislation legalizing cannabis. Any inroads these companies make in halting or impeding legislative initiatives that would not be beneficial to the cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on our business and, in turn, on our operations. Businesses involved in the cannabis industry are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crimes, decreasing access to secure banking and other financial services. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve money laundering, financial record-keeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the USA Patriot Act), and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. Since the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of cannabis remains illegal under the CSA, banks and other financial institutions 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 providing services to cannabis-related businesses risk violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes (18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957) and the Bank Secrecy Act, among other applicable federal statutes. Accordingly, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan or any other service could be criminally prosecuted for willful violations of money laundering statutes, in addition to being subject to other criminal, civil, and regulatory enforcement actions. Banks often refuse to provide banking services to businesses involved in the cannabis industry due to the present state of the laws and regulations governing financial institutions in the U.S. The lack of banking and financial services presents unique and significant challenges to our business. The potential lack of a secure place in which to deposit and store cash, the inability to pay creditors through the issuance of checks, and the inability to secure traditional forms of operational financing, such as lines of credit, are some of the many challenges presented by the unavailability of traditional banking and financial services. The above-mentioned laws and regulations can impose criminal liability for engaging in certain financial and monetary transactions with the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity such as distributing controlled substances, including cannabis, which are illegal under federal law, and for failing to identify or report financial transactions that involve the proceeds of cannabis-related violations of the CSA. We may also be exposed to the foregoing risks. In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department FinCEN issued a memorandum (the FinCEN Memorandum providing guidance to banks seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum and states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. The FinCEN Memorandum directed prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The revocation of the Cole Memorandum has not yet affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has FinCEN given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Shortly after former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum in January 2018, FinCEN did state that it would review the FinCEN Memorandum, but FinCEN has not yet issued further guidance. Although the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, it is unclear whether the current administration will continue to follow its guidelines. The DOJ continues to have the right and power to prosecute crimes committed by banks and financial institutions, such as money laundering and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, that occur in any state including states that have in some form legalized the sale of cannabis. Further, the conduct of the DOJ s enforcement priorities could change for any number of reasons. A change in the DOJ s priorities could result in the prosecution of banks and financial institutions for crimes that were not previously prosecuted. If our operations or revenues derived from our operations were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds from a crime (the sale of a Schedule I drug) under the Bank Secrecy Act s money laundering provisions. This may restrict our ability to access our capital and utilize our established banking institutions for routine services, payments, and distributions. The FinCEN Memorandum does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the DOJ, FinCEN or other federal regulators. Thus, most banks and other financial institutions in the United States do not appear comfortable providing banking services to cannabis-related businesses or relying on this guidance given that it has the potential to be amended or revoked by the current administration. This has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our ability to establish and maintain banking relationships. There are no assurances that this position will change under the Biden administration or under future administrations. Increased uncertainty surrounding financial transactions related to cannabis activities may also result in financial institutions discontinuing services to the cannabis industry, reducing our already-limited access to banking services. In addition to the foregoing, banks may refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. As a result, we may have limited or no access to banking or other financial services in the United States. In addition, federal money laundering statutes and Bank Secrecy Act regulations discourage financial institutions from working with any organization that sells a controlled substance, 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 regardless of whether the state it operates in permits cannabis sales. Our inability or limitation of our ability to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card payments may make it difficult for us to operate and conduct our business as planned or to operate efficiently. Other potential violations of U.S. federal law resulting from cannabis-related activities include the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act RICO ). RICO is a federal statute providing criminal penalties in addition to a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. Under RICO, it is unlawful for any person who has received income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity (which includes most felonious violations of the CSA), to use or invest any of that income in the acquisition of any interest, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in interstate commerce. RICO also authorizes private parties whose properties or businesses are harmed by such patterns of racketeering activity to initiate a civil action against the individuals involved. Although RICO suits against the cannabis industry are rare, a few cannabis businesses have been subject to a civil RICO action. As such, all officers, managers and owners in a cannabis related business could be subject to criminal prosecution under RICO, which carries substantial criminal penalties, and the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as its officers, managers and owners could all be subject to civil claims under RICO. Defending such claims could be extremely costly and potentially fatal to our business operations. On March 18, 2021, the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (the SAFE Banking Act was reintroduced in the House of Representatives. On March 23, 2021, the bill was reintroduced in the Senate as well. The House previously passed the SAFE Banking Act in September 2019, but the measure stalled in the Senate. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the House of Representatives approved the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which included the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The U.S. Senate did not take up the SAFE Banking Act in 2022 and therefore the measure must pass both the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate in subsequent Congressional sessions, of which there can be no guarantee. The SAFE Banking Act (or a similar bill) would allow financial institutions to provide their services to state-legal cannabis clients and ancillary businesses serving state-legal cannabis businesses without fear of federal sanctions. There is no guarantee the SAFE Banking Act will become law in its current form or at all. Access to banking and other financial services is limited in the cannabis industry, and we are not always able to obtain quality services, favorable market rates, or financially advantageous opportunities as compared to businesses in other industries. Given the current regulatory framework regarding cannabis at the federal level in the United States, traditional bank financing is typically not available to cannabis companies. Specifically, since financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under anti-money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statutes, and the Bank Secrecy Act, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Banks that do accept deposits from cannabis-related businesses in the United States must do so in compliance with the FinCEN Guidance, which typically increases the cost to the cannabis business due to increased due diligence requirements and regulatory complexity. We have banking relationships in the states where we operate; however, we have limited access to traditional bank financing. We have utilized private financing through use of private offerings to raise capital in the past, but securing private financing in the cannabis industry can be difficult due to the federal illegality of marijuana and often includes substantial costs and fees. Additionally, the health of the banking industry as a whole could impact our banking access and liquidity. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. If some or all of the limited subset of banks and financial institutions willing to engage with the cannabis industry enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If any of our banks were to experience such an insolvency event, it might be difficult for us to establish new banking relationships on a timely basis with favorable terms due to our participation in the cannabis industry, which could generate operational delays, challenges making and receiving payments to support operations, and additional resource demands. In addition, if 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 any of the parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. There is a risk of civil asset forfeiture of our assets. Since the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property was never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. We may be unable to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts. There is an argument that the federal bankruptcy courts cannot provide relief for parties who engage in cannabis or cannabis-related businesses. Recent bankruptcy rulings have denied bankruptcies for cannabis dispensaries upon the justification that businesses cannot violate federal law and then claim the benefits of federal bankruptcy for the same activity and upon the justification that courts cannot ask a bankruptcy trustee to take possession of and distribute cannabis assets as such action would violate the CSA. Therefore, due to our cannabis-related business, we may not be able to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts, and this could materially affect our financial performance and/or our ability to obtain or maintain credit. Risks Related to our Operations We have a relatively short operating history. We have a relatively short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including those related to: market acceptance of our current and future products and services; changing regulatory environments and costs associated with compliance; our ability to compete with other companies offering similar products and services; our ability to effectively market our products and services and attract new customers; the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; our ability to control costs, including operating expenses; our ability to manage organic and strategic growth; market cycles, pricing pressure, and new and emerging market growth; public perception and acceptance of cannabis-related products and services generally; and general economic conditions and events. 
 If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business and financial performance will be adversely affected. Our long-term results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on the commercial success of our products and services, the continued growth of the cannabis industry generally (including public acceptance of cannabis-related products) and the regulatory environment in which the cannabis industry operates. If the legalized cannabis marketplace does not continue to grow because the public does not increasingly accept cannabis-related products, or if government regulators adopt laws, rules or regulations that terminate or diminish the ability for commercial businesses to develop, market and sell cannabis-related products, our business and financial performance would be materially adversely affected. Additionally, even if the cannabis marketplace continues to grow rapidly and government regulation allows for the free-market development of this industry, there can be no assurance that our products and services will be preferable to or competitive with those offered by our competitors. The legalized cannabis industry may not continue to grow and the regulatory environment may not 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 remain favorable to participants in the industry. More generally, our products and services may not experience growing market acceptance, which would adversely impact our ability to grow revenue. Our business is dependent on regulatory licensing. Our business is dependent on us obtaining various licenses from various municipalities and state licensing agencies. There can be no assurance that any or all licenses necessary for us to operate cannabis businesses will be obtained, retained or renewed. If a licensing body were to determine that we violated applicable rules and regulations, there is a risk the license granted to us could be revoked, which could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Further, in some local jurisdictions in Colorado and New Mexico, licenses for cannabis operations are tied to a specific location, and we operate substantially all our operations through leases. If we are unable to renew any of our leases, we could potentially lose the license for such location. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain their licenses going forward, or that new licenses will be granted to us or existing and new market entrants. We have incurred significant losses in prior periods and there is no assurance we can generate profits; future losses could cause the quoted price of our Common Stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due and on our cash flow. We have incurred significant losses in prior periods. There can be no assurance that we will generate profits in any particular year or at all in the future. Our ability to generate profits will depend on a number of factors and is subject to risks, many of which are beyond our control. Any losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our Common Stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flow. We may be unable to attract or retain skilled labor and personnel with experience in the cannabis sector, acquire adequate equipment, parts, and components for operational needs, and we may be unable to attract, develop and retain additional employees required for our operations and future developments. We may be unable to attract or retain employees with sufficient experience in the cannabis industry, and may prove unable to attract, develop and retain additional employees required for our development and future success. Our success is currently largely dependent on the performance of our skilled employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, our ability to compete and grow will be dependent upon having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to skilled labor, adequate equipment, parts and components, and real estate zoned or permitted for cannabis use. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in maintaining the required supply of skilled labor, adequate equipment, parts and components, or sufficient real estate. It is also possible that the final costs of major equipment purchases or expansion projects budgeted by our capital expenditure projections may be significantly greater than anticipated or available, and there could be a materially adverse effect on our financial results in such instances. We may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions or dispositions or to successfully manage the impacts of such transactions on our operations. A key element of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring interests in, or the businesses of, suitable entities involved in the cannabis industry. Our ability to identify such potential acquisition opportunities and successfully acquire them is not guaranteed. Further, achieving the benefits of future acquisitions will depend, in part, on successfully identifying and capturing such opportunities in a timely and efficient manner with the appropriate structure to ensure a stable and growing stream of revenues. Material acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions involve a number of risks, including: (i) the potential disruption of our ongoing business; (ii) the distraction of management away from the ongoing oversight of our existing business activities; (iii) incurring indebtedness; (iv) the anticipated benefits and cost savings of those transactions not being realized fully, or at all, or taking longer to realize than anticipated; (v) an increase in the scope and complexity of our 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 operations; (vi) the loss or reduction of control over certain of our assets; (vii) the integration of new operations, services and personnel; (viii) unforeseen or hidden liabilities; (ix) the diversion of resources from our existing interests and business; (x) potential inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset new costs; or (xi) the expenses of such transactions. Further, there is no guarantee that future acquisitions will be accretive. The existence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company or business that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition could result in our incurring those liabilities. A strategic transaction may result in a significant change in the nature of our business, operations and strategy, and we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in implementing a strategic transaction or integrating any acquired business into our operations. We have limited access to capital and funds available for operations and growth, and we will require additional financing to successfully implement our business strategy. Expansion of our business will require capital expenditures. Our capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the size and success of our marketing and sales network, the quality of and demand for our products and services, and the terms of our external financing arrangements. If funds generated from our operations are insufficient to allow us to grow in accordance with our strategic plans, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may have to reduce or eliminate expenditures and curtail or delay our growth strategy, including the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities and future acquisitions, which likely would have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we raise additional capital in the future by issuing equity securities or securities exercisable for or convertible into equity securities, existing holders of our Common Stock could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities issued could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to our existing stockholders. Furthermore, if we raise additional capital in the future by incurring debt or issuing debt securities, such debt may impose covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make dividends and other payments, issue securities and buy and sell assets, or otherwise restrict financial or operational activities, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Our existing debt and financing arrangements, including the Loan Agreement and the Indenture, contain restrictions on the amount of debt the Company can issue without obtaining the approval of the applicable secured party or parties, which can add delays and complexity in executing the Company s acquisition strategy. Our officers or directors may have conflicts of interest and some of our current officers have other interests outside of our business. Some of our executive officers or directors are employed on a full-time basis by or have financial interests in other businesses. Consequently, there are potential inherent conflicts of interest when acting in their capacity as officers or directors of the Company. For example, Brian Ruden, a former director as of October 2022 and beneficial owner of more than 10 of our voting stock and Naser Joudeh, a beneficial owner of more than 10 of our voting stock, jointly hold the right to appoint two or three directors to our Board (depending on Board size and subject to minimum ownership requirements), are owners of Star Buds dispensaries located outside the state of Colorado, and have an ownership stake in the entity that licenses the Star Buds branding and intellectual property to the Company pursuant to a licensing arrangement. Many of our directors have also participated directly or indirectly in our private placements and capital raises, such as participation in the Investor Notes offering by four of our directors. Where a conflict of interest may arise, our Audit Committee and/or the full Board of Directors, with advice from outside counsel, reviews such conflict of interest. Although we believe that our related party transaction policy is currently adequate in guarding against material conflicts of interests, we cannot give any assurance that we are able to identify all material conflicts of interest or that conflicts of interest will be resolved in a manner beneficial to the Company. Further, while we have employment agreements for full-time employment with our executive officers, the employment agreements do not forbid our executive officers from allocating their personal time to other ventures and commitments. If the other business affairs of our executive officers require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to source raw materials in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, and at acceptable costs, our ability to manufacture and sell our products may be harmed. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for raw materials used in manufacturing our products. We experience recurring cycles of oversupply and undersupply, to some extent due to seasonality, and, as a result, the price and availability of raw materials fluctuates. If we are unable to maintain a reliable supply of raw materials at competitive prices, we could experience disruptions in production or an increased cost of production. Market conditions may limit our ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our raw material costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on key utility services. Our business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs, including raw materials and supplies related to our growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other local utilities. Our cannabis growing operations consume and will continue to consume considerable energy, which makes us vulnerable to rising energy costs. Accordingly, rising or volatile energy costs may adversely impact our business and our ability to operate profitably in the future. Additionally, any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for our key inputs could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to secure required supplies and services on satisfactory terms, it could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to service or repay our indebtedness when due, the applicable lender may execute on the collateral. We have outstanding indebtedness that is secured by a security interest in all of our assets. If we fail to comply with the covenants set forth in the applicable debt instruments or if we fail to make certain payments under the debt instruments when due, the holders of such indebtedness could declare the debt instruments in default. If we default under any such debt instruments, the holders have the right to seize our assets that secure the debt instruments, which would have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. Several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are borrowers under a Loan Agreement with Altmore, as lender, and GGG Partners LLC, as collateral agent. The loan is secured by a security interest in substantially all current and future assets of the borrowers. We guaranty the payment and performance by the borrowers when due. If the borrowers and we are unable to pay the debt service or repay the term loan when due, the lender may, among other remedies, sell the collateral and use the proceeds to satisfy amounts owed under term loan. The seller notes associated with the purchase of the Star Buds assets by SBUD LLC are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the current and future assets of SBUD LLC. If SBUD LLC is unable to pay the debt service or repay the seller notes when due, the sellers may, among other remedies, sell the collateral and use the proceeds to satisfy amounts owed under the seller notes. Our Investor Notes are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the current and future assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors not otherwise pledged as collateral, which are held by the Indenture Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Note Investors, and payment under the Investor Notes and Indenture are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Investor Notes provide that on December 7, 2025, the Note Investors will have the right to require the Company to repurchase some or all of the Investor Notes for cash in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Investor Note being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of repurchase. If the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors are unable to pay the debt service or repay the Investor Notes when due, the Indenture Collateral Agent may, among other remedies, sell the collateral and use the proceeds to satisfy the amounts owed under the Investor Notes.

 We plan to expand our business and operations into jurisdictions outside of the jurisdictions where we currently conduct business and doing so will expose us to new risks. In the future, we plan to expand our operations and business into jurisdictions outside of the jurisdictions where we currently operate. There can be no assurance that any market for our products and services will develop in any such jurisdictions. We may face new or unexpected risks or significantly increase our exposure to one or more existing risk factors if we expand into new jurisdictions, including, without limitation, economic instability, new competition, and additional, new or changing laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the possibility that we could be in violation of these laws and regulations as a result of such changes). These factors may limit our ability to successfully expand our operations in those other jurisdictions. Failure to consummate identified acquisitions could materially adversely affect our capital resources and subsequent attempts to locate and acquire other businesses. The investigation of each specific acquisition target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant transaction agreements and other ancillary documents, disclosure documents, and other instruments, requires substantial management time and attention, as well as costs related to fees payable to counsel, accountants, and other third parties. Our ability to consummate an acquisition is dependent on a number of factors and conditions that require time, attention, and collaboration across multiple parties, including receipt of all necessary state and local approval of the contemplated transaction. When an identified transaction is not consummated, we are not able to recover the cost spent pursuing such transaction, which reduces the amount of capital available for other identified targets. Our growth strategy is dependent on identifying willing counterparties to transact with, and our ability to acquire existing businesses in the future could also be impacted if we are consistently unable to consummate negotiated acquisitions. Our inability to efficiently identify, diligence, and acquire future acquisition targets could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and ability to execute on our growth strategy. Our sales are difficult to forecast. We must rely largely on our own market research and market research from newer companies in the cannabis industry to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other, more reliable sources at this early stage of the cannabis industry. A failure in the demand for our products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Changes in consumer spending may harm our business. Consumer spending patterns, particularly discretionary expenditures for cannabis products, are particularly susceptible to factors beyond our control that may reduce demand for our products. These factors include: low consumer confidence; decreased corporate budgets and spending, including cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business events (e.g., industry conventions); market conditions, pricing pressure, inflation, and similar macro-economic influences; natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes and floods; outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1(swine) flu, Zika fever and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19); war, terrorist activities, social unrest, or threats and heightened security measures instituted in response to these events; and the financial or operational conditions of transportation-related industries and its impact on travel. 
 Reduced consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We are subject to risks from products liability claims. We face an inherent risk of product liability claims. For example, we could be sued if any product we sell allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit sales of our products. Even a successful defense of these hypothetical future cases would require significant financial and management resources. If we are unable to successfully defend these hypothetical future cases, we could face at least the following potential consequences: decreased demand for our products;
 injury to our reputation;
 costs to defend the related litigation;
 diversion of management s time and our resources;
 substantial monetary awards to users of our products;
 product recalls or withdrawals; and
 loss of revenue.
 
 Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. While we intend to maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties in our business. It is also not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Due to the nature of our business, we may have difficulty obtaining insurance because, compared to non-cannabis industries, (i) there are only a limited number of insurers willing to insure companies involved in the cannabis industry, (ii) there are fewer insurance products available to companies involved in the cannabis industry, (iii) insurance coverage generally is more expensive for companies involved in the cannabis industry, and (iv) available insurers, insurance products, and cost of coverage fluctuates frequently. Failure to obtain adequate insurance coverage on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain business interruption insurance for most of our properties and operations. Any business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We may be exposed to risk of fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors and consultants. We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent unauthorized conduct that violates: (i) government regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal, state and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data; or (v) contractual arrangements, including confidentiality requirements. It may not always be possible for us to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by us to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or contractual requirements. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

 Failure to execute our strategies and external market conditions could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact profitability. As of December 31, 2022, we have goodwill of approximately 94.6 million and other intangible assets of approximately 107.7 million (net of accumulated amortization), which represents approximately 63 of our total assets as of that date. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based upon the fair value of each reporting unit. We assess the impairment of other intangible assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management s estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would reduce earnings in such period. Risks Related to our Common Stock and Preferred Stock We may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing securities that would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. We may raise additional capital in the future. Such capital raising transactions may take the form of equity issuances, debt raising, issuance of derivative securities, or a combination thereof. If we issue any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock in connection with any capital raising transaction, our existing stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon such issuance or upon the future conversion or exercise of such securities. Further, derivative securities, such as convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Common Stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Common Stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible securities), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock. Depending on the terms available to us, if these activities result in significant dilution, it may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of Common Stock. Any additional financing that we secure may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to, or pari passu with, those of our Common Stock or our other outstanding securities. Any issuances by us of securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other derivative securities or instruments senior to our shares of Common Stock. We cannot be certain how the repayment of any debt obligations will be funded, and we may issue further equity or debt in order to raise funds to repay such obligations, including funding that may be highly dilutive. The holders of any securities or instruments we may issue may have rights superior to the rights of holders of our Common Stock. If we experience dilution from the issuance of additional securities and we grant superior rights to new securities over holders of our Common Stock, it may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of Common Stock, and you may lose all or part of your investment. There is no assurance that there will continue to be an active trading market for our Common Stock. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQX operated by the OTC Markets Group and listed on the NEO exchange. There is no assurance that a market for our Common Stock will continue. In the absence of a public trading market, or sufficient trading volume in the public market, an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our Company.

 Any adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock could make it difficult for us to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, or in anticipation that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock, if and when such market develops in the future. The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in the future. We expect that the market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate in response to one or more of the following factors, many of which are beyond our control: competitive pricing pressures; our ability to market our products and services on a cost-effective and timely basis; our inability to obtain working capital financing, if needed; changing conditions in the market; changes in market valuations of similar companies; stock market price and volume fluctuations generally; regulatory developments; fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; additions or departures of key personnel; future sales of our Common Stock or other securities; and future issuances of shares of Common Stock upon exercise or conversion of derivative securities, such as our outstanding Preferred Stock, Investor Notes, warrants and options. 
 The price at which our stockholders purchase shares of our Common Stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. Our stockholders may be unable to sell their shares of Common Stock at or above such purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to such stockholders and which could include the complete loss of such stockholders investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of stock price volatility. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and our resources away from our business. Any of the risks described above could adversely affect our sales and profitability and also the price of our Common Stock. The market price for our Common Stock will be particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a limited operating history and lack of profits, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our stockholders may be unable to sell their Common Stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to such stockholders. While there is a market for our Common Stock, our stock price in the future may be particularly volatile when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies with large public floats that trade on a national securities exchange. The volatility in our share price will be attributable to a number of factors. First, our Common Stock is, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of our Common Stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we are a speculative or risky investment due to our limited operating history, lack of profitability, and uncertainty surrounding future market acceptance for our products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company with a large public float trading on a national securities exchange. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our Common Stock will be at any time.

 FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our Common Stock, which could depress the price of our Common Stock. FINRA has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer before recommending an investment to a customer. Before recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit investors ability to buy and sell our shares of Common Stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares of Common Stock, and thereby depress the price per share of Common Stock. Because we hold a license to operate a cannabis business in Colorado and New Mexico, our stockholders may be required to make filings with the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division or the New Mexico Cannabis Control Division and we may be forced to redeem shares of our capital stock held by stockholders who are deemed unsuitable to be owners of our Company. We hold various licenses from the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division and the New Mexico Cannabis Control Division to operate a cannabis business in Colorado and New Mexico. As a result, beneficial owners with a 10 or greater interest are required to make filings with, and to be found suitable to be equity owners of a cannabis business in Colorado, by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division. Our Bylaws provide that for as long as we hold (directly or indirectly) a license for a governmental agency to conduct our business, which license is conditioned upon some or all of our stockholders possessing certain qualifications, we may redeem any and all of our shares of capital stock to the extent necessary to prevent loss of such license or to reinstate such license. If we at any time determine, in our sole discretion, that one of our stockholders or an affiliate of a stockholder is unsuitable to be a direct or indirect equity owner of a cannabis business in Colorado or any other jurisdiction we may operate in where we are subject to other similar licensing or suitability requirements, we have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem such stockholder s shares of capital stock at a redemption price described in Exhibit 4.1 to this Report. After redemption, a stockholder would only be allowed to own up to 9.99 of the Company. Company funds used to redeem an unsuitable stockholder will reduce funds available for operations and distributions. This redemption right may negatively impact potential investors willingness to invest in our Common Stock, which could negatively impact the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition, the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation related to the Preferred Stock and the Indenture provide for a similar redemption right in favor of the Company that is specific to the Preferred Stock and the Investor Notes if a holder of such securities or one of its affiliates is determined by an applicable state governmental authority to be unsuitable or disqualified from owning a direct or indirect interest in the Company. Our future results of operations may vary significantly, which could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. It is possible that our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not necessarily serve as meaningful indicators of or benchmarks for future performance. You should not rely on the results of any one quarter or year as an indication of our future performance. It is also possible that in some future quarters or years, our revenues and operating results will fall below our expectations or the expectations of market analysts and investors. If we do not meet these expectations, the price of our Common Stock may decline significantly. Our Preferred Stock, our right to issue additional preferred stock, our classified Board of Directors, the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the concentration of Board appointment rights with a few insiders may delay or prevent a take-over that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our Preferred Stock and provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt.

 The existence and terms of our Preferred Stock and our Investor Notes, such as the ability of a majority of the holders of the Preferred Stock to require payment of a liquidation preference upon a change of control, the right of Note Holders to require the Company to repurchase for cash the Investor Notes in connection with a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), or the ability to convert shares of Preferred Stock and Investor Notes into Common Stock and the resulting changes in ownership interests of the Company, may prevent or impede a change of control transaction for the Company that could otherwise be in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. Further, holders of Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on any matter presented to the Company s stockholders for their action or consideration at any meeting (or by written consent in lieu of meeting), voting together with the holder of Common Stock as a single class. Therefore, holders of Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome on all matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of a change of control transaction for the Company. Further, our authorized capital consists of 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share. Our Board of Directors, without further vote by the stockholders, has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences, price and restrictions, including but not limited to voting and dividend rights, of any such shares of preferred stock. The rights of the holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be affected by the rights of holders of preferred stock that our Board of Directors may issue in the future. In addition, we have a classified Board of Directors, which means that one-half of our directors are eligible for election each year. Therefore, if stockholders desire to change the composition of the Board of Directors, it may take at least two years to remove a majority of the existing directors or to change all directors. Having a classified Board of Directors may also, among other things, delay mergers, tender offers or other possible transactions that may be favored by some or a majority of stockholders, and may delay or frustrate stockholder action to change the then-current Board of Directors and management. Certain members of our Board and principal stockholders also maintain the contractual right to nominate individuals to occupy eight of our nine director seats so long as they maintain certain agreed-upon ownership amounts, and our Board is required to recommend such nominees for election to the Board so long as the ownership requirements are met. This could frustrate our stockholders ability to nominate and successfully appoint qualified directors independent of management. The concentration of Board appointment rights in a small number of insiders could also create conflicts of interest that might result in actions not in the best interest of our stockholders if such conflicts are not sufficiently managed and assessed in accordance with sound corporate governance principles. Our management and principal stockholders could significantly influence or control matters requiring a stockholder vote, and other stockholders may not have the ability to influence corporate transactions. Currently, management and our principal stockholders beneficially own a significant amount of our outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock. As a result, management and such principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. As of March 1, 2023, our executive officers and directors controlled more than a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, based on the number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock outstanding as of such date or convertible into Common Stock within 60 days of such date. Therefore, management and our principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a change of control transaction for the Company. We are classified as a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock and other securities less attractive to investors. We are classified as a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K. As such, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if

 investors will find our Common Stock and other securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock or other securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation in the value of our Common Stock. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms and provisions of our financing agreements, including but not limited to our Loan Agreement, the Indenture, and the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation related to our Preferred Stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any contractual provisions related to the payment of dividends that we may be a party to at the time. To the extent we do not pay dividends, our shares of Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price appreciates, for which there can be no guarantee. In addition, investors must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize a return on their investment; if the price of our Common Stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock. Our Preferred Stock ranks senior to our Common Stock but junior to all of our existing and future liabilities in the event of a liquidation, winding up or dissolution of our business. In the event of liquidation, winding up or dissolution, our assets would be available to make payments to holders of our Preferred Stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid, and to holders of our Common Stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid and holder of our Preferred Stock have been paid. Our Preferred Stock ranks structurally senior to our Common Stock, but junior to all of our existing and future liabilities and those of our subsidiaries, such as our Loan Agreement and the Investor Notes, as well as the capital stock of our subsidiaries held by third parties and employees, whether now existing or created in the future, that issues shares or other equity interests to third parties or employees. In the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of the Company, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries liabilities, to pay any amounts to the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, or, thereafter, to pay any amounts to the holders of the Common Stock then outstanding. Any liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Company or of any of our wholly or partially-owned subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on holders of the Preferred Stock or holders of the Common Stock. Risks Relating to Information Technology, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property We may be subject to risks related to our information technology systems, including the risk that we may be the subject of a cyber-attack and the risk that we may be in non-compliance with applicable privacy laws. We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology IT ), services in connection with our operations. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our vendors protect our networks, equipment, IT systems and software against damage from several threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism, theft, malware, ransomware and phishing attacks. Any of these and other events could result in IT system failures, delays or increases in capital expenses. Our operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as preemptive expenses to mitigate the risk of failures. The failure of IT systems or a component of IT systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We collect and store personal information about our consumers and are responsible for protecting that information from privacy breaches. Some of our consumers purchase our products for medical use. There are several laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information and other personal information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, in the U.S., the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Privacy Act ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLBA ), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA ), and the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA and together with the Privacy Act, the GLBA, HIPAA, and COPPA the U.S. Privacy Regulations ), the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), the privacy rules under Canada s Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (the PIPEDA ), and similar laws in other jurisdictions, protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure to the minimum level reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. A privacy breach may occur through an internal procedural or process failure, an IT malfunction or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Theft of data for competitive purposes, particularly patient lists and preferences, is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated through employee collusion, negligence, or deliberate cyber-attack. Moreover, if we are found to be in violation of the U.S. Privacy Regulations, the GDPR, the PIPEDA, or other laws, including as a result of data theft and privacy breaches, we could be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. While we have implemented security resources to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Significant disruption to our information technology system or breaches of data security could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property as a result of our participation in the cannabis industry. When entering into confidentially agreements with our employees, consultants, and corporate clients, we take what we believe are commercially reasonable steps to control access to and protect the distribution of our technologies, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties may attempt to disclose, obtain, or use our products, solutions, or technologies. We cannot be certain that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary solutions or technologies. Further, this is particularly difficult in foreign countries where the laws or law enforcement may not provide as robust protection of the Company s proprietary rights as compared to United States laws and law enforcement. As of the date of this report, we are shipping nutrients outside of the United States, but we do not currently conduct any operations outside of the United States or any territory thereof. The Company does not have current plans to expand its operations to foreign jurisdictions. Because the manufacture, cultivation) sale, possession and use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, cannabis-related businesses may have restricted intellectual property rights particularly with respect to obtaining trademarks and enforcing patents. If we are unable to register or maintain our trademarks, or file for or enforce patents on any of our inventions, such an inability could materially affect our ability to protect our name and proprietary technologies. In addition, cannabis businesses may face court action by third parties under RICO. Our intellectual property rights could be impaired as a result of our cannabis-related business, and we could be named as a defendant in an action asserting a RICO violation. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims of infringement against us. Others may claim rights to the same technology or trade secrets we currently utilize or may utilize in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us. Any such claims, or any resultant litigation, should it occur, could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our contractual proprietary rights. In addition, even if we were to win any such litigation, such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of time and attention, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. Any claims or litigation may also result in limitations on our ability to use such trademarks, patents and other intellectual property unless we enter into arrangement with such third parties, which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms.

 General Risk Factors We are dependent upon our management and corporate support employees to continue our growth. There are no assurances we will be able to continue or sustain our growth. However, if we are able to continue and sustain our growth in a sustainable fashion, we will need to significantly expand our administrative facilities, which we believe is and will remain necessary to address potential market opportunities. Rapid growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. Our success is principally dependent on our competent management personnel and our corporate support staff for the operation of our business. We may not be able to hire or retain qualified staff. If qualified and skilled staff are not attracted and retained, growth of our business may be limited. The ability to provide high quality service will depend on attracting and retaining qualified staff, as well as professionals with experience relevant to our market, including marketing, technology, and general experience in the cannabis industry. There will be competition for personnel with these skill sets. Some technical job categories may experience severe shortages in the United States due to general economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of experience, and other similar constraints on the U.S. labor market. Our ability to deliver quality services depends on our ability to manage and expand our marketing, operational and distribution systems, recruit additional qualified employees, and train, manage, and motivate both current and new employees. Failure to effectively manage our employees and labor resources would have a material adverse effect on our business. The general market conditions in the United States may have a significant impact on our business. The success of our business is affected by general economic and market conditions. We will remain susceptible to future economic recessions or downturns, and any significant adverse shift in general economic conditions, whether local, regional or national, could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. During such periods of adverse economic conditions, we may experience reduced demand for our products and services, which will result in, among other things, decreased revenues and financial losses. In addition, during periods of adverse economic conditions, we may have difficulty accessing financial markets or face increased funding costs, which could make it more difficult or impossible for us to obtain additional financing if needed. We cannot ensure that we will always be able to maintain adequate internal controls. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to help prevent fraud. Although we will undertake several procedures and will implement a number of safeguards, in each case, in order to help ensure the reliability of our financial reports, including those imposed under U.S. securities law, we cannot be certain that such measures will ensure that we will always be able to maintain adequate internal controls over financial processes and disclosure. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market s confidence in our consolidated financial statements and materially adversely affect the value or trading price of our securities, which could in turn impact our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. The estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot assure, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. Any potential litigation related to the estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing

 our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, harm our business, and cause our share price to decline. Climate change could exacerbate certain of the risks inherent in our agricultural operations. Climate change could result in increasing frequency and severity of weather-related events, resource shortages, changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages and changing temperatures, any of which can damage or destroy crops, resulting in us having no or limited cannabis to process. If we are unable to harvest cannabis through our proprietary cultivation operations, our ability to meet customer demand, generate sales, and maintain operations will be impacted. Climate change is most likely to disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and costs of materials and resources needed for production, and it could increase insurance, compliance, and other operating costs. While most of our cultivation operations are conducted indoors, we may be directly or indirectly exposed to climate change risk from natural disasters, changes in weather patterns and severe weather, which may result in physical damage to our cultivation and processing facilities, potentially requiring expenditures to respond during the event, to recover from the event, and to possibly modify existing or future infrastructure requirements to prevent recurrence. Such damage may result in disrupted operations, and it may be difficult for us to continue its business for a substantial period of time, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results and could cause the market value of our stock to decline. In addition, climate change has continued to attract the focus of governments, the scientific community and the general public as an important threat, given the emission of greenhouse gases and other activities continue to negatively impact the planet. We face the risk that our operations will be subject to government initiatives aimed at countering climate change, which could impose constraints on our operational flexibility or require additional expenses or infrastructure changes to comply with such initiatives. Epidemics, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other health crises could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The global outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus known as COVID-19 resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. These measures, which include the implementation of travel bans, self-imposed quarantine periods and social distancing, caused material disruption to businesses globally, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global equity markets have experienced significant volatility and weakness. Governments and central banks have reacted with significant monetary and fiscal interventions designed to stabilize economic conditions. The duration and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown at this time, as is the efficacy of the government and central bank interventions. It is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of these developments or their impact on our financial results and condition. Thus far, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Nonetheless, our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of such a risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including our retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our products. These risks could also adversely affect our customers financial condition, resulting in reduced spending for the products we sell. Moreover, any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, including COVID-19, could cause our employees to avoid public spaces, which could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and manage our businesses. Shelter-in-place or other such orders by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations if employees who cannot work remotely are not able to report to work. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our stores or other facilities. Although our dispensaries were considered essential services through the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore were allowed to remain operational, there can be no guarantee that our adult-use operations will continue to be allowed to remain open during a pandemic or other health crisis or that our retail dispensary operations would be deemed essential.

 The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent its further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, growth strategies and results of operations. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events. The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks, social unrest, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other natural disasters, emergence or continuation of a pandemic (such as COVID-19), or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), could create economic and financial disruptions, which could lead to operational difficulties that could impair our ability to manage our business. We operate in a new and novel industry for which there is no precedent or historical data to indicate how the industry, or the Company, would be impacted by such an event. Tax and accounting requirements may change in ways that are unforeseen to us and we may face difficulty or be unable to implement or comply with any such changes. We are subject to numerous tax and accounting requirements, and changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, or varying interpretations of current rules or practices could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results, the manner in which we conduct our business or the marketability of any of our products. Our operations, and any expansion thereto, will require us to comply with the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, which may vary substantially. Complying with the tax laws of these jurisdictions can be time consuming and expensive and could potentially subject us to penalties and fees in the future if we were to fail to comply. Due to our limited financial resources, litigation could negatively impact our financial condition even if such claims are without merit. Litigation is used as a competitive tactic by both established companies seeking to protect their existing position in a given market and emerging companies attempting to gain access to a market. In such litigation, complaints may be filed on a variety of grounds, including but not limited to antitrust violations, breach of contract, trade secret, patent or copyright infringement, patent or copyright invalidity and unfair business practices. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether or not meritorious, we are likely to incur substantial expense and diversion of management attention, which could result in market confusion and the reluctance of licensees and distributors to commit resources to our operations. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations is costly, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and requires us to maintain and have available specialized systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current periodic reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our operating costs and expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. Being a public company, rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. Also, our business and financial condition are visible to the public, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Even if potential future claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve such claims could divert the attention and resources of management and adversely affect our business and operating results.

The real property owned by Emerald Fields Merger Sub, LLC in Manitou, Colorado, is subject to a first priority security interest in favor of the Indenture Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Note Investors pursuant to the Indenture. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. On June 7, 2019, the Company filed a complaint against ACC Industries Inc. and Building Management Company B, L.L.C., in state district court located in Clark County, Nevada, alleging, amongst other causes of action, breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment and seeking general, special and punitive damages. On July 17, 2019, the parties stipulated to stay the case in favor of arbitration. On February 25, 2020 ACC Industries Inc. filed a counterclaim against the Company alleging breach of contract. The Company discovered new facts that lead it to believe that a related entity not previously named as a party to the arbitration, ACC Enterprises, LLC ACC ), should be brought in as a party to the arbitration. Based upon the new facts, the Company filed a motion to amend the complaint to add new claims and ACC as a party. On September 1, 2020, the arbitrator granted the Company s motion and permitted the Company to amend the complaint to add ACC as a party. On September 1, 2020, the Company filed an amended complaint and added intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, civil conspiracy, aiding and abetting, successor liability and fraudulent concealment claims. The Company began arbitration proceedings on November 2, 2020. The Company completed arbitration in February 2021. On May 14, 2021, the Arbitrator entered an award in favor of the Company in the aggregate amount of 1,935,273, subject to an offset equal to 150,000, for a total net award of 1,785,273. After the arbitration award was entered, a receiver was appointed over ACC and its affiliates due to the death of the only owner who had a valid cannabis establishment registration agent card. An automatic litigation stay was entered upon the appointment of the receiver. During the receivership, ACC s owners have had internal ownership disputes and ACC has had financial difficulties. The receiver has taken the position that ACC should be liquidated. On April 28, 2022, the receiver received approval from the court to liquidate ACC s assets. On May 24, 2022, upon the completion of a bidding procedure for certain ACC assets, the court approved the sale of certain ACC assets to the only and prevailing bidder. The finality of that sale is in progress and near completion. On July 26, 2022, the court approved a creditors claim process. The Company complied with the claim process and is awaiting formal approval from the receiver. The Company believes its claim will be approved and will continue to participate in the receivership. The Company will file a motion to terminate the

Table of Contents 
 receivership and request the court distribute the proceeds obtained from the asset sale. The Company is the largest creditor and believe the assets will be distributed pro rata. The Company is not aware of the total amount of proceeds or the number of creditors who have perfected a claim against the proceeds. On July 6, 2018, the Company filed a complaint in the Eight Judicial Court, Clark County, Nevada against Vegas Valley Growers VVG ). In the complaint, the Company alleges breach by VVG of the Technologies License Agreement dated April 27, 2017 between the parties and seeks general, special and punitive damages in the amount of 3,876,850. On August 28, 2018, VVG filed an Answer and Counterclaim against the Company. On August 2, 2019, a jury found in favor of the Company and awarded the Company damages totaling 2,773,321 plus pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys fees. In March 2020, VVG filed its opening appeal brief with the Nevada Supreme Court. The Company s response brief was due on May 15, 2020. After VVG filed its opening brief in March 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Strike portions of the brief and record. On August 27, 2020, the court ordered VVG to supplement its brief and the record. On October 27, 2020, the Company, in a joint request with VVG, filed a motion to extend its time to file its answering brief. The Company filed its answering brief in January 2021. VVG s reply brief was filed in March 2021. On July 23, 2021, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the trial court s damage award but remanded the case to the trial court to properly calculate post-judgment interest. After the affirmance, VVG filed a petition for rehearing with the Nevada Supreme Court arguing it overlooked or misapprehended material facts in the record. The Company answered the rehearing petition arguing that it did not. On December 22, 2021, the Company received 3,577,200 for most of the outstanding receivable plus interest and legal fees. There remained an unpaid balance of 12,438 in long term accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. A second disbursement was made in January 2022 in the amount of 362,698 which constituted accrued interest. The Company reached a resolution on the outstanding attorney s fees owed to the Company, which VVG paid in full. The Company filed a notice with the Court indicating that the attorney s fees and all other monetary awards in the case had been paid in full, which was the end of the remaining issues in the legal proceeding. The legal proceeding is now considered to be resolved and closed. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not Applicable.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Report. OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY Established in 2014 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, Medicine Man Technologies, Inc., is a vertically integrated cannabis company with experienced retail leadership and operations in Colorado and New Mexico. The Company is focused on building a premier, vertically-integrated cannabis company by taking its retail operating playbook to other states where it can develop a differentiated leadership position. The Company strives for a high-performance culture that combines customer-centric thinking and data science to test, measure, and drive decisions and outcomes. DEVELOPMENTS 2022 Highlights The Company continued to execute its growth strategy during 2022 by completing a number of key acquisitions and further developing existing operations. Some of the Company s achievements for the year include: 
 Entry into the New Mexico market in February 2022 with the acquisition of ten R. Greenleaf retail dispensaries, four cultivation facilities, and one manufacturing facility from RGA prior to adult-use legalization taking effect in New Mexico; Expansion of retail footprint and cultivation capacity in Colorado with the acquisitions of: 
 o two Emerald Fields retail dispensaries located in Glendale, Colorado and Manitou, Colorado from MCG; o one indoor cultivation facility located in Denver, Colorado from Brow; o two retail dispensaries located in Aurora, Colorado, and Denver, Colorado from Lightshade; o two retail dispensaries located in Boulder, Colorado from Drift; and o one retail dispensary and one indoor cultivation facility located in Denver, Colorado from Urban Dispensary.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs 2021 2022 2021 Total revenue 159,379,219 108,420,239 50,958,980 47 Total cost of goods and services 74,349,421 59,066,545 15,282,876 26 Gross profit 85,029,798 49,353,694 35,676,104 72 Total operating expenses 72,174,964 38,944,528 33,230,436 85 Income (loss) from operations 12,854,834 10,409,166 2,445,668 23 Total other income (expense) (16,424,385) 8,506,128 (24,930,513) (293) Provision for income taxes (benefit) 14,898,064 4,396,164 10,501,900 239 Net income (loss) (18,467,615) 14,519,130 (32,986,745) (227) Earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders - basic (0.49) 0.17 (0.66) (396) Earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders - diluted (0.49) (0.06) (0.43) 788 Weighted average number of shares outstanding - basic 53,637,003 43,339,092 Weighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted 53,637,003 101,368,958 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Total Assets 322,882,733 285,030,792 Long-Term Liabilities 143,338,054 106,197,948 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Revenue Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled 159,379,219, compared to revenues of 108,420,239 representing an increase of 50,958,980, or 47 . This increase was influenced by a number of factors, including consummation of identified acquisitions, new store openings, entrance into the New Mexico market, and adult-use legalization taking effect in New Mexico in 2022. In 2022, the Company completed seven acquisitions and opened six new stores not related to acquisitions, which increased the Company s retail presence from 18 dispensaries as of December 31, 2021 to 41 dispensaries as of December 31, 2022. Based on publicly available sales data, management estimates that overall cannabis sales in the New Mexico market increased approximately 75 as compared to 2021 sales as a result of increased adult-use recreational cannabis sales following its legalization in April 2022.

Table of Contents 
 Cost of Goods and Services Cost of goods and services for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled 74,349,421 compared to cost of goods and services of 59,066,545 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 15,282,876, or approximately 26 . This increase was due to the opening of six new stores in 2022, as well the consummation and integration of seven acquisition transactions. The Company also increased its cultivation capacity from two cultivation facilities as of December 31, 2021 to five cultivation facilities as of December 31, 2022, which inherently increased cost of goods and services. Gross Profit Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 85,029,798 compared to gross profit of 49,353,694 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of approximately 72 . The change in gross profit is driven by the factors that influenced revenue and cost of goods and services for 2022 discussed above. While the Company s cost of goods and services expense increased in 2022, it increased at a lower rate than the Company s consolidated revenue, which increased by 47 in 2022, as compared to an increase in cost of goods and services of 26 during 2022. This is due to increased vertical integration and improved internal cost of operations that pass through to retail margins along with operation synergies leveraging internal economies of scale in each state where the Company operates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled 72,174,964, compared to operating expenses of 38,944,528 during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 33,230,436 or approximately 85 . This increase was largely due to increased selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes certain one-time impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2022, and increased salary expenses. SG A The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses SG A is predominantly attributable to expenses related to acquisition activity and increased overhead associated with entry into the New Mexico market. The Company consummated three acquisitions in 2021 as compared to seven acquisitions in 2022, and the Company was required to expend additional resources on non-reoccurring acquisition services in 2022 due to this increased activity. SG A related to acquisition activity totaled 6,822,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, up from 2,779,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Rent payments for Retail leases increased approximately 163 during 2022 as a result of acquisitions and new store openings, which also caused SG A to increase as compared to the prior period. Impairments During 2022, the Company discontinued operations related to its consulting business, one cultivation facility in New Mexico acquired in the R. Greenleaf acquisition, and one cultivation facility in Colorado acquired in the Star Buds acquisitions. The Company had approximately 11.7 million of goodwill impairment, of which 3,708,226 is related to discontinued of its consulting practice in 2022, which is reported under other income (expense) section of the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income as a loss on business disposition. Salary and Labor Costs The Company s workforce increased from 281 full-time employees as of December 31, 2021 to 658 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022, causing operating expenses for salary and compensation to increase as compared to the prior year. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled 16,424,385, compared to other income, net of 8,506,128 during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase in expenses of 24,930,513, or

 approximately 293 . The largest driver of this change was the increased interest obligations associated with the Investor Notes and the loss on disposition of assets, which was partially offset by the gain on derivative liability. Interest expenses related to the Investor Notes totaled 30,139,645, which includes 17,093,370 in cash interest. The non-cash portion of the interest totaled 13,046,275, which includes amortization of the debt discount and closing costs associated with the Investor Notes and 4,118,390 of interest that is paid as an accretion to the principal of the Investor Notes for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to accrued interest of 1,425,278 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, the Company recognized a loss on disposition of assets of 4,684,366 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes 3,708,226 of goodwill related to the discontinuation of the Company s consulting business and 875,400 of intangible impairment also related to discontinued operations of a cultivation facility in Colorado. The remaining 100,740 of the loss recorded is related to other assets and liabilities written off for these discontinued operations. Net Income (Loss) As a result of the factors discussed above, we generated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, of 18,467,615, compared to net income of 14,519,130 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue by Segment 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs 2021 2022 2021 Retail 141,254,893 73,761,010 67,493,883 92 Wholesale 17,819,938 34,434,091 (16,614,153) (48) Other 304,388 225,138 79,250 35 Total revenue 159,379,219 108,420,239 50,958,980 47 Retail revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 141,254,893, an increase of 67,493,883 or 92 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Retail revenues was primarily driven the by acquisition of seven new dispensaries in Colorado, the Company s acquisition of ten R. Greenleaf dispensaries in February 2022, the opening of six new stores independent of acquisitions, and the legalization of adult-use recreational cannabis sales coming into effect in New Mexico in April 2022. Prior to consummation of the acquisition to acquire R. Greenleaf, the Company did not have active operations in New Mexico. Revenues for the Wholesale segment were 17,819,938 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 16,614,153 or 47 compared to December 31, 2021. Wholesale revenues decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to over-supply and negative pricing pressure in the wholesale market. Based on published pricing data from the State of Colorado, the average price per pound of cannabis flower decreased from 1,220 per pound in 2021 to 706 per pound in 2022. This is a year-over-year decrease of 42 in average retail price, which correlates directly to wholesale pricing. Other revenues were 304,388 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 79,250 or 35 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Other revenue was primarily driven by increased organizational promotional activity with retail vendors in an effort to increase store traffic. Management discontinued its historical licensing and consulting practices as the company prioritizes its strategic growth initiatives. As such, Other revenue is expected to be derived from promotional activities and other potential non-retail and wholesale activities rather than consulting-based services in future periods. DRIVERS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenue The Company derives its revenue from three revenue streams: (i) Retail, which sells finished goods sourced internally and externally to the end consumer in retail stores; (ii) Wholesale, which is the cultivation of flower and biomass used internally and/or sold externally and the manufacturing of biomass into distillate for integration into internally and externally 
 50 

Table of Contents 
 developed products, such as edibles and internally developed products such as vapes and cartridges under the Purplebee s brand; and (iii) Other, which includes other income and expenses, such as in-store advertising and corporate operations. Gross Profit Gross profit is revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid for finished goods such as flower, edibles, and concentrates, as well as manufacturing and cultivation labor, packaging cost and labor, supplies and overhead such as rent, utilities and other related costs. Cannabis costs are affected by market supply. Gross margin measures our gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses other than the costs of goods sold consists of selling costs to support customer relations, marketing and branding activities. It also includes spend on corporate infrastructure required to support the Company s ongoing business. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is derived from Operating Income, which is adjusted for one-time expenses including merger and acquisition and capital-raising costs, non-cash related compensation costs, goodwill impairment, costs related to discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, and other one-time expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, please see the section entitled Non-GAAP Measures below. Average Basket Size Average Basket Size is calculated based on the average dollar value of all total items purchased by a single customer during a single visit to one of the Company s retail dispensary stores. Management monitors and utilizes Average Basket Size to assess consumer preferences and behavior, effectiveness of consistent reward and discount offerings, and product performance. Management believes this metric can be useful to investors for a better understanding of average customer spend and revenue across all Company retail dispensaries. Recorded Customer Visits The Recorded Customer Visits metric reports the number of customers that have visited any of the Company s retail dispensary stores and made a purchase. Customer visits are recorded at the time of purchase. If a customer makes multiple purchases in a day, each purchase is counted as an individual visit. Management uses Recorded Customer Visits to monitor and assess Company performance in the markets where it operates, consumer acceptance of the Company s brand and products, customer retention, and store traffic. Recorded Customer Visits is a useful non-financial metric for investors to contextualize the Company s assessment of overall market performance from a customer and sales perspective and evaluate consumer appetite for cannabis products. Same Store Sales and Stacked IDs The Company utilizes Same Store Sales and Stacked Identical Store Sales Stacked IDs to evaluate and monitor organic sales of existing dispensaries. Management believes these metrics are useful for investors to assess management of our retail stores and to distinguish revenue and growth from operations from revenue and growth from acquisitions. Same Store Sales and Stacked IDs are both expressed as a percentage that indicates the relative increase or decrease to revenue for certain retail stores from the relevant previous reporting period. Same Store Sales are calculated by comparing revenue from sales for all dispensaries owned by the Company and open for operations for more than one year against the revenue from the sales for the same dispensaries for the previous year. Stacked IDs, which is derived from Same Store Sales, reflects Same Store Sales compared against the revenue from the sales of the same dispensaries for the previous two years. When the Company reports Same Store Sales and Stacked IDs for stores that it has not owned for more than one year, the comparison is made against validated sales data from prior owners of such stores provided to the Company upon acquisition. Consolidated Stacked IDs for 2022 were 7.9 .

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 38,949,253 and 106,400,216, respectively to meet its current obligations. The Company had negative operating working capital of 14,595,528 as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 12,662,059 as compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease in operating working capital is primarily driven by the use of cash for the Company s growth and to satisfy debt obligations. During 2022, the Company paid a total of approximately 62.4 million in cash for acquisitions, and it entered into nine new real property leases, each of which tended to negatively impact operating working capital. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had total current liabilities of 47,420,826 and 45,263,179, respectively. Current liabilities increased from 2021 due to overall expansion and growth. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and lease liabilities increased by 206 , 84 , and 135 , respectively, as compared to the prior period in large part due to new store openings, acquisition integration, and operational development such as expansions, improvements, and remodels of existing facilities. The overall decrease in current liabilities is attributable to the change is derivative liabilities, which is influenced by the Company s stock price and other market conditions outside of the Company s control. The Company is an early-stage growth company, generating cash from operational revenue and capital raises. The Company predominantly relies on internal capital that is generated through operational revenue and any other internal sources of liquidity to meet its short-term and certain long-term capital demands. Management believes the Company s current projected growth and revenue from operation of preexisting and newly acquired assets will be sufficient to meet its current obligations as they become due. The Company also relies on a combination of internal and external capital to meet its long-term obligations, with internal liquidity sourced from operational revenue and external financing acquired from various sources, including commercial loan arrangements, capital raises and private placement transactions, and cash from the Investor Notes. Management believes this combination of internal cash generated from operations and external liquidity will be sufficient to meet the Company s long-term obligations; however, it is possible the Company will seek additional external financing to meet capital needs in the future. The Company maintains the unused portion of the funds received from the Investor Notes for future acquisitions and execution of its strategic growth initiatives. Trends Impacting Liquidity While management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to support its capital needs, certain factors may positively or negatively impact the Company s liquidity and financing opportunities. Due to our participation in the cannabis industry and the regulatory framework governing cannabis in the United States, our debt and loan arrangements are sometimes subject to higher interest rates than are market for other industries, which has an unfavorable impact on our liquidity and capital resources. We also tend to incur higher banking fees and rates than businesses in other industries. Additionally, the cash requirements to service our debt obligations increase with the passage of time due to interest accrual, which increases constraints on our capital resources and tends to reduce liquidity in the amount of such accruals. We currently anticipate meeting these cash requirements from operating revenue and cash on hand. While participation in the cannabis industry tends to negatively impact certain aspects of capital resources more than other industries, this could change in the future with changes to federal law. If the federal government enacts laws permitting the banking and financial industries to engage with the cannabis industry, such as passage of the SAFE Banking Act, which passed in the House of Representatives in 2022 but did not pass in the U.S. Senate, the Company anticipates that this could have a positive impact on the Company s liquidity because it will open up financing and refinancing opportunities not otherwise widely available to cannabis companies at this time due to the current regulatory landscape. One of our strategic goals is to grow our business through acquisitions, which also tends to negatively impact liquidity during periods when we consummate an identified acquisition. We expect to continue executing this strategy in future periods, meeting such capital requirements in connection therewith from both internal capital and external financing (including unused funds from the Investor Notes), which will decrease liquidity.

 The wholesale cannabis market has experienced downward pricing pressure from over-supply of certain cannabis products in the market, which has affected retail margins in certain periods and will likely impact the relationship between cost and revenue if and/or when supply is constrained. However, we maintain the ability to shift between external sales and internal use or transfer of our wholesale products due to vertical integration based on market conditions, which may mitigate some of the negative impacts of wholesale market downturns. Wholesale pricing can affect margins positively or negatively depending on market conditions, but profit as a percentage of revenue tends to have an inverse relationship with market pricing conditions. Wholesale pricing increases could reduce retail margins and also generate positive profitability in the wholesale segment, and vice versa. The Company anticipates that the wholesale market will likely remain depressed relative to previous recent years, which can negatively impact the Company s overall liquidity. Increasing inflation may also negatively impact our liquidity, as our cost of goods and services may increase without corresponding increases to revenue. Inflation increases could also impact our incremental borrowing rate and ability to obtain external financing on similar terms as previous financing arrangements. Increasing inflation and general economic downturn in the United States could also negatively impact revenue to the extent such factors affect consumer behavior. Additional factors or trends that have impacted or could potentially impact liquidity in future periods include general economic conditions such as market saturation, inflation, and general economic downturn. Cash Flows Net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were as follows: 

For the Periods Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities 11,356,512 8,397,712 Net cash used in investing activities (79,184,371) (81,163,754) Net cash provided by financing activities 376,895 177,935,023 Operating activities During 2022, the Company had approximately 11.4 million of net cash provided by operating activities, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 8.4 million in 2021, representing an overall increase in cash provided by operating activities of approximately 3 million when compared to the prior period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven by improved focus on working capital throughout 2022 as the size of the overall business increased when compared to 2021. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately 1.98 million in 2022 as compared to the prior year. Cash used in investing activities is driven by acquisition activity, purchases of property, plant and equipment for existing entities, and strategic investment opportunities. The slight decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a shift in structure of acquisition consideration, using less cash in closing deals in favor of more stock consideration. While the number of acquisition transactions increased in 2022 when compared to 2021, the overall cash consideration for these transactions was less in 2022. Financing activities Cash provided from financing activities decreased by approximately 177.6 million as compared to the prior year, which is largely due to cash from the Investor Notes, the seller notes, and the Loan Agreement, all of which resulted in cash inflows in 2021.

The deferred Nuevo Note incurs 5 interest per year, payable on the first of each month. The principal is due February 7, 2025. The Nuevo Note is unsecured. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments and Contingencies Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of debt and interest related payments, lease obligations, and purchase price obligations for acquisitions. Management believes that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures, debt services, working capital needs, and other contractual obligations for the next twelve months. We may need to obtain additional external financing to meet our material long-term obligations, and management believes the Company will need additional financing to continue execution of its growth strategy in future periods.

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated Financial Statements), the ones that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty, judgment and complexity are revenue recognition, stock based compensation, derivative instruments, income taxes, goodwill and commitments and contingencies are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances We have three main revenue streams: (i) retail sales, (ii) wholesale sales, and (iii) other revenues from revenues from marketing and promotional activities and other miscellaneous sources not otherwise directly related to our retail and wholesale operations. During 2022, we ceased providing licensing and consulting services, strategically discontinued that portion of our business operations, and are no longer providing these services. The Company s retail and wholesale sales are recorded at the time that control of the products is transferred to customers. In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to customers, we consider several indicators, including significant risks and rewards of products, our right to payment, and the legal title of the products. Based on the assessment of control indicators, our sales are generally recognized when products are delivered to customers. The Company s other revenue, typically from marketing and promotional services, is recognized when our obligations to our client are fulfilled, which is determined when milestones in the contract are achieved. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations. Certain criteria are required to be met in order to recognize revenue. If these criteria are not met, then the associated revenue is deferred until the criteria are met. A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received in advance of the delivery of goods or services. We identify revenue contracts upon acceptance from the customer when such contract represents a single performance obligation to sell our products. Stock Based Compensation We account for share-based payments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation and, accordingly, we record compensation expense for share-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock and restricted stock awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our stock compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under ASC 718 when stock or options are awarded for previous or current service without further recourse. Income Taxes ASC 740, Income Taxes requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill arising from our acquisitions is attributable to the value of the potential expanded market opportunity with new customers. Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life, whichever is 
 57 

Table of Contents 
 shorter. Our amortizable intangible assets consist of licensing agreements, product licenses and registrations, and intellectual property or trade secrets. Their estimated useful lives range from 3 to 15 years. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. We perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process performed at the reporting unit level. Step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by considering both the income approach and market approaches. The fair values calculated under the income approach and market approaches are weighted based on circumstances surrounding the reporting unit. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit, which are discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. For the discount rate, we rely on the capital asset pricing model approach, which includes an assessment of the risk-free interest rate, the rate of return from publicly traded stocks, our risk relative to the overall market, our size and industry and other risks specific to us. Other significant assumptions used in the income approach include the terminal value, growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. The market approaches use key multiples from guideline businesses that are comparable and are traded on a public market. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one. In this step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, strategic plans, and future market conditions, among others. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Changes in assumptions and estimates could cause us to perform an impairment test prior to scheduled annual impairment tests. We performed our annual fair value assessment as of December 31, 2022 on our subsidiaries with material goodwill on our respective balance sheets and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 11,719,306, of which 3,708,226 is presented under loss from disposal of assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income as it is related to ceased operations during 2022. No such impairment existed as of December 31, 2021. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not applicable.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. These controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022, at the reasonable assurance level. Inherent Limitations Management, including our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdown can occur because of simple error or mistake. In particular, many of our current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure that neither human error nor system weakness has resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data. MANAGEMENT ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 2013 Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, which were identified in conjunction with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to SEC rules that permit us, as a non-accelerated filer, to provide only management s report on internal control over financial reporting. Therefore, this Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION. None. ITEM 9C.
