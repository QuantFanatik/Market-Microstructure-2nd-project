 forward-looking statements. Generally, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, 
 anticipate, project, will, should, could, may, plan 
and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these

as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report and those described
from time to time in reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PART 1 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a commercial real estate finance company.
Our primary investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over time primarily through consistent
current income dividends and other distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by
originating, structuring and investing in first mortgage loans and alternative structured financings secured by commercial real estate
properties. Our current portfolio is comprised primarily of senior secured loans to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry.
We expect cannabis lending will continue to be a principal investment strategy for the foreseeable future; however, we expect to also
lend to or invest in companies or properties that are not related to the cannabis industry if they provide return characteristics consistent
with our investment objective. From time to time, we may also invest in mezzanine loans, preferred equity or other forms of joint venture
equity to the extent consistent with our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act and maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust REIT ). We may enter into credit
agreements with borrowers that permit them to incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the loans we extend to such companies
under such credit agreements. There is no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective. We commenced operations on March 30,
2021 and completed our initial public offering IPO in December 2021. 

We believe that cannabis operators limited
access to traditional bank and non-bank financing has provided attractive opportunities for us to make loans to companies that exhibit
strong fundamentals but require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can provide
in the current regulatory environment. We believe that continued state-level legalization of cannabis for medical and adult use creates
an increased loan demand by companies operating in the cannabis industry and property owners leasing to cannabis tenants. Furthermore,
we believe we are differentiated from our competitors because we seek to target operators and facilities that exhibit lower-risk characteristics
on a relative basis, which we believe include generally limiting exposure to ground-up construction, lending to cannabis operators with
operational and/or profitable facilities, diversification of geographies and distribution channels, among other factors. 

We are externally managed by Chicago Atlantic
REIT Manager, LLC (our Manager ). Our Manager and its affiliates seek to originate real estate loans between 5 million
and 200 million, generally with one- to five-year terms and amortization when terms exceed three years. We generally act as co-lenders
in such transactions and intend to hold up to 50 million of the aggregate loan amount, with the remainder to be held by affiliates
or third party co-investors. We may revise such concentration limits from time to time as our loan portfolio grows. Other investment
vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager may co-invest with us or hold positions in a loan where we have also invested,
including by means of allocating commitments, participating in loans or other means of syndicating loans. We will not engage in a co-investment
transaction with an affiliate where the affiliate has a senior position to the loan held by us. To the extent that an affiliate provides
financing to one of our borrowers, such loans will be working capital loans or loans that are subordinate to our loans. We may also serve
as co-lenders in loans originated by third parties and, in the future, we may also acquire loans or loan participations. 

Our loans are generally secured by real estate
and, when lending to owner-operators in the cannabis industry, also other collateral, such as equipment, receivables, intellectual property,
licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations governing such borrowers. 

As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio is comprised
primarily of first mortgages to established multi-state or single-state cannabis operators or property owners. We consider cannabis operators
to be established if they are state-licensed and are deemed to be operational by the applicable state regulator. We do not own any warrants
or other forms of equity in any of our portfolio companies that are involved in the cannabis industry, and we will not take warrants
or equity in such issuers until permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. federal laws and regulations. 

We impose strict loan covenants and seek personal
or corporate guarantees for additional protection. As of December 31, 2022, 13.6 of the loans held in our portfolio are backed by personal
or corporate guarantees. We aim to maintain a diversified portfolio across jurisdictions and across verticals, including cultivators,
processors, dispensaries, and other businesses ancillary thereto. In addition, we may invest in borrowers that have equity securities
that are publicly traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange CSE in Canada and/or over-the-counter in the United States. 

1 

We are an externally managed Maryland corporation
that elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that we have qualified as a REIT and that our method of operations will
enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since
qualification as a REIT depends on us continuing to satisfy numerous asset, income and distribution tests described under U.S.
Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation, , which in turn depend, in part, on our operating results. We also intend
to operate our business in a manner that will permit us and our subsidiaries to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration
under the Investment Company Act. 

Our Manager 

We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant
to our Management Agreement. Our senior management team is provided by our Manager and includes John Mazarakis, our Executive Chairman,
Anthony Cappell, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Andreas Bodmeier, our Co-President and Chief Investment Officer, and Peter Sack, our
Co-President. Our Manager is supported by additional investment professionals with significant expertise in executing our investment
strategy and accounting, operational, and legal professionals. 

Our Manager s Investment Committee, which
is comprised of John Mazarakis, Anthony Cappell, Dr. Andreas Bodmeier, and Peter Sack, advises and consults with our Manager and its
investment professionals with respect to our investment strategy, portfolio construction, financing, investment guidelines, and risk
management, and approves all of our investments. The investment professionals of our Manager have over 100 years of combined experience
in private credit, real estate lending, retail, real estate acquisitions and development, investment advice, risk management, and consulting.
Collectively, the investment professionals have originated, underwritten, structured, documented, managed, or syndicated over 8.0 billion
in credit and real estate transactions, which includes loans to cannabis operators, loans to companies engaged in activities unrelated
to cannabis, as well as commercial real estate loans. The depth and breadth of the management and investment team allows our Manager
to address all facets of our operations. 

Pursuant to our Management Agreement with our
Manager, our Manager manages our loan portfolio and our day-to-day operations, subject at all times to the further terms and conditions
set forth in our Management Agreement and such further limitations or parameters as may be imposed from time to time by our board of
directors (our Board ). Under our Management Agreement, our Manager has contractual responsibilities to us, including to
provide us with a management team (whether our Manager s own employees or individuals for which our Manager has contracted with
other parties to provide services to its clients), who will be our executive officers, and the Manager s Investment Committee.
Our Manager will use its commercially reasonable efforts to perform its duties under our Management Agreement. 

The initial term of our Management Agreement
is for three years and shall continue until May 1, 2024. After the initial term, our Management Agreement shall automatically renew
every year for an additional one-year period, unless we or our Manager elect not to renew. Our Management Agreement may be terminated
by us or our Manager under certain specified circumstances. 

The following table summarizes the compensation,
fees and expense reimbursements that we pay to our Manager under our Management Agreement. A portion or all of the fees may be paid in
shares of our common stock, at the sole discretion of our Manager.

Our Competitive Strengths 

We expect demand for financing in the cannabis
market to continue to rise due to recent and future state legalization of cannabis for recreational and medical use, while federal prohibition
on cannabis use and commercialization hampers certain commercial and financial activities. We believe we are well positioned to maintain
and expand our position as a credible source of financing for cannabis industry operators and other property owners with the goal of
becoming the lender of choice to leading cannabis industry operators, due to the following factors: 

Leading Cannabis Lending Platform. Chicago
Atlantic Group, LLC (our Sponsor and its affiliates have originated and closed 52 loans totaling approximately 1.8 billion
to companies operating in the cannabis industry, making their first loan to a cannabis operator in April 2019. We believe we are a leading
capital provider in the cannabis ecosystem with the requisite domain expertise, deep relationships, nimble execution capabilities, stringent
underwriting standards, and strong risk analytics to become the lender of choice in the industry. We believe our broad network of deep
relationships allows us to originate a substantial number of loans that are not broadly marketed. We believe we are differentiated from
our competitors because we seek to target operators and facilities that exhibit lower-risk characteristics on a relative basis, which
we believe include generally limiting exposure to ground-up construction, lending to cannabis operators with operational and profitable
facilities, diversification of geographies and distribution channels, among other factors. 

Sizable Portfolio with Compelling Risk-Adjusted
Returns That is Secured by Different Types of Collateral. We believe our current portfolio investments have attractive risk-adjusted
returns. As of December 31, 2022, the yield to maturity YTM IRR on our loans is 19.7 on a weighted average basis and
ranges from 14.2 to 25.9 through coupons, OID, unused fees, and exit fees. Our loans are primarily secured by real property and certain
personal property, including licenses, equipment, and other assets to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the regulations governing
our borrowers. 

Disciplined, Credit-First 
Underwriting Process. We have developed a systematic underwriting process that applies a consistent approach
to credit review and approval, with a focus on evaluating credit first and then appropriately assessing the risk-reward profile of each
loan. We subject all of our potential loans and operators to rigorous underwriting criteria. Our assessment of credit is paramount, as
we seek to minimize potential credit losses through effective due diligence, structuring, and covenant design. We seek to customize each
transaction structure and financial and operational covenants to reflect risks identified through the underwriting and due diligence
process with the goal of maximizing risk-adjusted returns. Our Manager s investment professionals have extensive experience with
and the ability to execute on innovative financing solutions that meet the needs of cannabis operators. We also seek to actively supplement
our origination and credit underwriting activities through site visits and consistent dialogue with operators and outside capital partners,
if any. 

Our Team s Track Record in Identifying
Market Inefficiencies. Members of our Manager s Investment Committee have had successful careers
in private credit, real estate lending, acquisitions, and development, consumer retail, investments, risk management, and consulting.
We believe that our willingness and ability to invest and lend in market niches encumbered by regulatory uncertainty, where constrained
or less nimble market participants are absent, offers us a distinct advantage. We believe our focus on identifying opportunities in such
markets provides for commensurate returns relative to risk. Our relentless pursuit of all relevant information in connection with each
transaction is a discrete focus of our investment team. We believe by carefully assessing specific challenges and because we possess
the ability to understand and quantify the risks involved, we are able to effectively capitalize on market inefficiencies. We believe
these types of assets provide an attractive, and often overlooked, investment opportunity. 

Nimble Execution. We believe we have
nimble execution capabilities, with the ability to redeploy capital more quickly than the typical REIT land ownership models because we
offer shorter terms on our loans than typical equity REITs. Our current portfolio as of February 28, 2023 has an average maturity of 2.0
years with significant prepayment protections, whereas we believe that certain competitors with typical equity REIT land ownership models
have long-term leases averaging approximately 16 years. The duration of our loans, as compared to the length of leases usually employed
by equity REITs, allows us to redeploy our capital with more flexibility as market changes occur instead of being locked in for longer
periods of time. This model also allows our borrowers to retain control of their real estate assets, which is important to their businesses
and allows for more flexibility regarding their capital structure.

Our Growth Strategy 

Objective 

Our primary investment objective is to provide
attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over time, primarily through consistent current income dividends and other distributions
and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by originating, structuring and investing in a diversified
portfolio of income-producing first mortgage loans and alternative structured financings secured by commercial real estate properties.
Our current portfolio is comprised primarily of senior loans to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry, secured by real estate,
equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations governing
such borrowers. We intend to grow the size of our portfolio by continuing the track record of our business by making loans to leading
operators and property owners in the cannabis industry. 

Key elements of our strategy include: 

Targeting loans for origination and investment that typically have the following characteristics: 

principal balance greater than
 5 million; 

real estate collateral coverage
of at least one times the principal balance; 

secured by commercial real estate
properties, including cannabis cultivation facilities, processing facilities and dispensaries; and 

well-capitalized operators with
substantial experience in particular real estate sectors and geographic markets. 

Diversifying our financing sources with increased access to equity and debt capital, which may
 provide us with a lower overall cost of funding and the ability to hold larger loan sizes, among other things. 

We intend to continue providing financing to
state-licensed cannabis cultivators, processors, distributors, retailers, vertically-integrated cannabis firms, non-plant touching manufacturers,
suppliers, and service providers to such industries, and other businesses ancillary thereto, located in the U.S. and Canada. We will
continue to focus on operators with strong collateral, in the form of real estate, equipment and receivables owned by the borrower, and
may opportunistically invest in all asset lien cash flow loans, to the extent that allows us to maintain our qualification
as a REIT, with a strict focus on adhering to conservative underwriting criteria. Our Manager will regularly evaluate loans and intends
to retain an independent third-party valuation firm to provide input on the valuation of unquoted assets, which our Manager considers
along with various other subjective and objective factors when making any such evaluation. The collateral underlying our loans is located
in states in the U.S. that we believe have attractive regulatory environments for companies operating in the cannabis industry, economic
conditions and commercial real estate fundamentals. 

An evaluation of the real estate and other collateral
is an important part of our Manager s underwriting process, but we may be limited in our ability to foreclose on certain collateral.
If we expect that exercising rights and remedies available to us would lead to a lower recovery, we may instead seek to sell a defaulted
loan to a third party or force the sale of collateral underlying the loan as permitted in our standard loan agreements. There may be no
readily available market for our loans, so we can provide no assurances that a third party would buy such loans or that the sales price
of such loans would be sufficient to recover our outstanding principal balance. For more information, see Risk Factors 
Certain assets of our borrowers may not be used as collateral or transferred to us due to applicable state laws and regulations governing
the cannabis industry, and such restrictions could negatively impact our profitability . 

We may diversify our portfolio by also lending
or investing in properties that are not related to the cannabis industry if they provide return characteristics consistent with our investment
objective. From time to time, we may invest in mezzanine loans, preferred equity or other forms of joint venture equity. 

We draw upon our Manager s expertise in
sourcing, underwriting, structuring and funding capabilities to implement our growth strategy. We believe that our current growth strategy
provides significant potential opportunities to our stockholders for attractive risk-adjusted returns over time. However, to capitalize
on the appropriate loan opportunities at different points in the economic and real estate investment cycle, we may modify or expand our
growth strategy from time to time. 

Manager s Investment Committee 

The Manager s Investment Committee overseeing
the loan portfolio and the loan origination process for us is focused on managing our credit risk through a comprehensive investment
review process. As part of the investment process, the Manager s Investment Committee must approve each loan before commitment
papers are issued. 

In addition, the Audit Committee of our Board
may assist our Board in its oversight of the determination of the fair value of assets that are not publicly traded or for which current
market values are not readily available by evaluating various subjective and objective factors, including input provided by an independent
valuation firm that we currently retain to provide input on the valuation of such assets.

Our Portfolio 

Overview 

As of February 28, 2023, loans to 24 different borrowers
comprise our portfolio, totaling approximately 364.1 million in total principal amount, with approximately 14.9 million in
potential future fundings to such borrowers. As of February 28, 2023, our loan portfolio had a weighted-average yield-to-maturity internal
rate of return YTM IRR of 19.1 and was secured by real estate and, with respect to certain of our loans, substantially
all assets in the borrowers and certain of their subsidiaries, including equipment, receivables, and licenses. The YTM IRR on our loans
is designed to present the total annualized return anticipated on the loans if such loans are held until they mature, which is consistent
with our operating strategy. YTM IRR summarizes various components of such return, such as cash interest, paid-in-kind interest, original
issue discount, and exit fees, in one measure that is comparable across loans. YTM IRR is calculated using various inputs, including (i)
cash and paid-in-kind PIK interest, which is capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the applicable
loan, (ii) original issue discount OID ), (iii) amortization, (iv) unused fees, and (v) exit fees. Certain of our loans
have extension fees, which are not included in our YTM IRR calculations, but may increase YTM IRR if such extension options are exercised
by borrowers. 

As of February 28, 2023, approximately 83.9 of our
portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans, and 16.1 of our portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans. As of such date, all of
our loans had prepayment penalties.

 Certain loans are subject to contractual extension options and may be subject to performance based on other conditions as stipulated in the loan agreement. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities stated herein as certain borrowers may have the right to prepay with or without a contractual prepayment penalty. The Company may also extend contractual maturities and amend other terms of the loans in connection with loan modifications.

 P = Prime Rate and depicts floating rate loans that pay interest at the Prime Rate plus a specific percentage; PIK = paid-in-kind interest; subtotal represents weighted average interest rate.

 P I = principal and interest. I/O = interest only. P I loans may include interest only periods for a portion of the loan term. 

(6) 
 Estimated YTM includes a variety of fees and features that affect the total yield, which may include, but is not limited to, OID, exit fees, prepayment fees, unused fees and contingent features. OID is recognized as a discount to the funded loan principal and is accreted to income over the term of the loan. The estimated YTM calculations require management to make estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the timing and amounts of loan draws on delayed draw loans, the timing and collectability of exit fees, the probability and timing of prepayments and the probability of contingent features occurring. For example, certain credit agreements contain provisions pursuant to which certain PIK interest rates and fees earned by us under such credit agreements will decrease upon the satisfaction of certain specified criteria which we believe may improve the risk profile of the applicable borrower. To be conservative, we have not assumed any prepayment penalties or early payoffs in our estimated YTM calculation. Estimated YTM is based on current management estimates and assumptions, which may change. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Collateral Overview 

Our loans to cannabis operators are secured by
various types of assets of our borrowers, including real property and certain personal property, including licenses, equipment, receivables,
and other assets to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the regulations governing our borrowers. As such, we do not have liens
on cannabis inventory and cannot foreclose on liens on state licenses as they are generally not transferable. See Risk Factors
 Certain assets of our borrowers may not be used as collateral or transferred to us due to applicable state laws and regulations
governing the cannabis industry, and such restrictions could negatively impact our profitability. 

The table below represents the real estate collateral
securing our loans as of December 31, 2022. The real estate collateral values in the table below were measured at the time of underwriting
and based on various sources of data available at such time. In addition, the real estate that secures our loans is appraised by a third
party at least once a year, or more frequently as needed. 

In the event that a borrower defaults on its
loan, we have a number of potential remedies that we may pursue, depending on the nature of the default, the size of the loan, the value
of the underlying collateral and the financial condition of the borrower. We may seek to sell the loan to a third party, provide consent
to allow the borrower to sell the real estate to a third party, institute a foreclosure proceeding to have the real estate sold or evict
the tenant, have the cannabis operations removed from the property and take title to the underlying real estate. We believe the appraised
value of the real estate underlying our loans impacts the amount of the recovery we would receive in each such scenario. However, the
amount of any such recovery will likely be less than the appraised value of the real estate and may not be sufficient to pay off the
remaining balance on the defaulted loan. 

7 

We may pursue a sale of a defaulted loan if we
believe that such sale would yield higher proceeds or that the sale could be accomplished more quickly than through a foreclosure proceeding
while yielding proceeds comparable to what would be expected from a foreclosure sale. To the extent that we determine that the proceeds
are more likely to be maximized through instituting a foreclosure sale or through taking title to the underlying property, we will be
subject to the rules and regulations under state law that govern foreclosure sales and NASDAQ listing standards that do not permit us
to take title to real estate while it is being used to conduct cannabis-related activities. If we foreclose on properties securing our
loans, we may have difficulty selling such properties and may be forced to sell a property to a lower quality operator or to a party
outside of the cannabis industry. Therefore, appraisal-based real estate collateral values shown in the table below may not equal the
value of such real estate if it were to be sold to a third party in a foreclosure or similar proceeding. We may seek to sell a defaulted
loan prior to commencing a foreclosure proceeding or during a foreclosure proceeding to a purchaser that is not required to comply with
NASDAQ listing standards. We believe a third-party purchaser that is not subject to NASDAQ listing standards may be able to realize greater
value from real estate and other collateral securing our loans. However, we can provide no assurances that a third party would buy such
loans or that the sales price of such loans would be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal balance, accrued interest, and fees.
See Risk Factors We will not own real estate as long as it is used in cannabis-related operations due to current statutory
prohibitions and exchange listing standards, which may delay or limit our remedies in the event that any of our borrowers default under
the terms of their mortgage loans with us .

 Senior Real Estate Corporate Loans are structured as loans to owner operators secured by real estate.
 Senior Loans are loans to a property owner and leased to third party tenant.

(2) 
 Real estate is based on appraised value as is, or on a comparable cost basis, as completed. The
 real estate values shown in the collateral table are estimates by a third-party appraiser of the market value of the subject real
 property in its current physical condition, use, and zoning as of the appraisal date. The appraisals assume that the highest and
 best use is use as a cannabis cultivator or dispensary, as applicable. The appraisals recognize that the current use is highly regulated
 by the state in which the property is located; however, there are sales of comparable properties that demonstrate that there is a
 market for such properties. The appraisals utilize these comparable sales for the appraised property s value in use. For properties
 used for cannabis cultivation, the appraisals use similar sized warehouses in their conclusion of the subject s as-is 
 value without licenses to cultivate cannabis. However, the appraised value is assumed to be realized from a purchase by another state-licensed
 cannabis operator or a third-party purchaser that would lease the subject property to a state-licensed cannabis operator. The regulatory
 requirements related to real property used in cannabis-related operations may cause significant delays or difficulties in transferring
 a property to another cannabis operator, as the state regulator may require inspection and approval of the new tenant/user. 

(3) 
 Certain affiliated co-lenders subordinated their interest in the real
 estate collateral to the Company, thus increasing the collateral coverage for the applicable loan. 

(4) The real estate collateral coverage ratio represents a weighted average
real estate collateral coverage ratio. 

Further, the value may also be determined using
the income approach, based on market lease rates for comparable properties, whether dispensaries or cultivation facilities. It indicates
the value to a third-party owner that leases to a dispensary or cultivation facility. 

Finally, the appraisal contains a value based
on the cost for another operator to construct a similar facility, which we refer to as the cost approach. We believe the
cost approach provides an indication of what another state-licensed operator would pay for a separate facility instead of constructing
it itself. 

The appraisal s opinion of value reflects
current conditions and the likely actions of market participants as of the date of appraisal. It is based on the available information
gathered and provided to the appraiser and does not predict future performance. Changing market or property conditions can and likely
will have an effect on the subject s value. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

In May 2021, in connection with the Company s
acquisition of its wholly-owned financing subsidiary, Chicago Atlantic Lincoln, LLC CAL ), the Company was assigned a secured
revolving credit facility (the Revolving Loan ). The Revolving Loan had an original aggregate borrowing base of up to 10,000,000
and bore interest, payable in cash in arrears, at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (x) Prime Rate plus 1.00 and (y) 4.75 . The
Company incurred debt issuance costs of 100,000 related to the origination of the Revolving Loan, which were capitalized and are subsequently
being amortized through maturity. The maturity date of the Revolving Loan was the earlier of (i) February 12, 2023 and (ii) the date on
which the Revolving Loan is terminated pursuant to terms in the Revolving Loan Agreement. 

On December 16, 2021, CAL entered into an amended
and restated Revolving Loan agreement (the First Amendment and Restatement ). The First Amendment and Restatement increased
the loan commitment from 10,000,000 to 45,000,000 and decreased the interest rate, from the greater of the (1) Prime Rate plus 1.00 
and (2) 4.75 to the greater of (1) the Prime Rate plus the applicable margin and (2) 3.25 . The applicable margin is derived from a floating
rate grid based upon the ratio of debt to equity of CAL and increases from 0 at a ratio of 0.25 to 1 to 1.25 at a ratio of 1.5 to 1.
The First Amendment and Restatement also extended the maturity date from February 12, 2023 to the earlier of (i) December 16, 2023 and
(ii) the date on which the Revolving Loan is terminated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Loan agreement. The Company has the option
to extend the initial term for an additional one-year term, provided no events of default exist and the Company provides the required
notice of the extension pursuant to the First Amendment and Restatement. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 859,500 related
to the First Amendment and Restatement, which were capitalized and are subsequently being amortized through maturity. 

On May 12, 2022, CAL entered into a second amended
and restated Revolving Loan agreement (the Second Amendment and Restatement ). The Second Amendment and Restatement increased
the loan commitment from 45,000,000 to 65,000,000. No other material terms of the Revolving Loan were modified as a result of the execution
of the Second Amendment and Restatement. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 177,261 related to the Second Amendment and Restatement,
which were capitalized and are subsequently amortized through maturity. 

On November 7, 2022, CAL entered into a third amended
and restated Revolving Loan agreement (the Third Amendment and Restatement ). The Third Amendment and Restatement increased
the loan commitment from 65,000,000 to 92,500,000. No other material terms of the Revolving Loan were modified as a result of the execution
of the Third Amendment and Restatement. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 323,779 related to the Third Amendment and Restatement,
which were capitalized and are subsequently amortized through maturity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unamortized debt issuance costs
related to the Revolving Loan and the First, Second and Third Amendments and Restatements of 805,596 and 868,022, respectively, are
recorded in other receivables and assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Revolving Loan incurs unused fees at a rate of 0.25 per annum which
began on July 1, 2022 pursuant to the Second Amendment and Restatement. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
borrowed 58.0 million against the Revolving Loan, which incurred an effective interest rate of 7.75 including the unused fee rate of
0.25 , and 34.5 million available under the Revolving Loan. 

The Third Amendment and Restatement provides for certain
affirmative covenants, including requiring us to deliver financial information and any notices of default, and conducting business in
the normal course. Additionally, the Company must comply with certain financial covenants including: (1) maximum capital expenditures
of 150,000, (2) maintaining a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.35 to 1, and (3) maintaining a leverage ratio less than 1.50
to 1. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants with respect to the Revolving Loan.

On February 27, 2023, CAL entered into the First Amendment
to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. This amendment extended the contractual maturity date of the Revolving
Loan until December 16, 2024. The Company retained its option to extend the initial term for an additional one-year period, provided no
events of default exist and the Company provides 365 days notice of the extension pursuant to this amendment. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding
balance of 58.0 million and 34.5 million available under the Revolving Loan. 

Government Regulation 

Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision,
and licensing under various United States, state, provincial, and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. In general, lending is
a highly regulated industry in the United States and we are required to comply with, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions
of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the USA Patriot Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and U.S. federal
and state securities laws and regulations. In addition, certain states have adopted laws or regulations that may, among other requirements,
require licensing of lenders and financiers, prescribe disclosures of certain contractual terms, impose limitations on interest rates
and other charges, and limit or prohibit certain collection practices and creditor remedies. We are required to comply with the applicable
laws and regulations in the states in which we do business. We actively monitor proposed changes to relevant legal and regulatory requirements
in order to maintain our compliance. 

Federal Laws Applicable to the Cannabis Industry 

Cannabis (with the exception of hemp containing
no more than 0.3 THC by dry weight) is illegal under U.S. federal law. In those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized,
its use remains a violation of federal law pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the CSA . The CSA
classifies marijuana (cannabis) as a Schedule I controlled substance, and as such, both medical and adult use cannabis are illegal under
U.S. federal law. Moreover, on two separate occasions the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the CSA trumps state law. That means that the
federal government may enforce U.S. drug laws against companies operating in accordance with state cannabis laws, creating a climate
of legal uncertainty regarding the production and sale of cannabis. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis
(and the President approves such amendment), there is a risk that the federal law enforcement authorities responsible for enforcing the
CSA, including the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ and the Drug Enforcement Agency DEA ), may enforce current
federal law. 

Under the Obama administration, the DOJ previously
issued memoranda, including the so-called Cole Memo on August 29, 2013, providing internal guidance to federal prosecutors
concerning enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions under the CSA. This guidance essentially characterized use of federal law enforcement
resources to prosecute those complying with state laws allowing the use, manufacture and distribution of cannabis as an inefficient use
of such federal resources where states have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and have also implemented strong and effective
regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. Conduct in compliance
with those laws and regulations was not a priority for the DOJ. Instead, the Cole Memo identified a list of federal enforcement priorities,
including preventing interstate diversion or distribution of cannabis to minors, to focus enforcement efforts against operations that
implicated these priorities. 

On January 4, 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General
Jeff Sessions issued a written memorandum rescinding the Cole Memo and related internal guidance issued by the DOJ regarding federal
law enforcement priorities involving cannabis (the Sessions Memo ). The Sessions Memo instructs federal prosecutors to enforce
the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutors when deciding whether to pursue
prosecutions related to cannabis activities. As a result, federal prosecutors could, and still can, use their prosecutorial discretion
to decide to prosecute actors compliant with their state laws. The Sessions Memo states that these principles require federal
prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set
by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular
crimes on the community. The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ s well-established general principles, previous
nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately. Although there have not been
any identified prosecutions of state law compliant cannabis entities, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not
enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future and it remains unclear what impact the Sessions Memo will have on the regulated
cannabis industry, if any. 

Jeff Sessions resigned as U.S. Attorney General
on November 7, 2018. On February 14, 2019, William Barr was confirmed as U.S. Attorney General. However, in a written response to questions
from U.S. Senator Cory Booker made as a nominee, Attorney General Barr stated I do not intend to go after parties who have complied
with state law in reliance on the Cole Memo. The DOJ under Mr. Barr did not take a formal position on federal enforcement of laws
relating to cannabis. Mr. Barr has stated publicly that his preference would be to have a uniform federal rule against cannabis, but,
absent such a uniform rule, his preference would be to permit the existing federal approach of leaving it up to the states to make their
own decisions. During Attorney General Merrick Garland s confirmation process, after being nominated by President Biden, he stated
 I do not think it is the best use of the Department s limited resources to pursue prosecution of those who are complying
with the law in states that have legalized and are effectively regulating marijuana. While Attorney General Garland s view
aligns with the policies set forth in the Cole Memo, the Cole Memo has not been formally re-adopted or updated, and there can be no assurances
that DOJ or other law enforcement authorities will not seek to vigorously enforce existing laws. 

10 

One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended
to federal appropriations legislation, remains in place. Commonly referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer or Rohrabacher-Farr 
Amendment, this so-called rider provision has been appended to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts since 2015. Under the
terms of the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer rider, the federal government is prohibited from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce
federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. On December 27, 2020,
Congress passed an omnibus spending bill that again included the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, extending its application until September
30, 2021. The amendment was recently renewed through September 2023 as a rider to the 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act. There is no
assurance that Congress will approve inclusion of a similar prohibition on DOJ spending in the appropriations bills for future years.
In United States v. McIntosh , the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this provision prohibits
the DOJ from spending funds from relevant appropriations acts to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use
cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. However, the Ninth Circuit s opinion, which only applies in
the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii and Idaho, also held that persons who do not strictly comply with all state laws and
regulations regarding the distribution, possession and cultivation of medical-use cannabis have engaged in conduct that is unauthorized,
and in such instances the DOJ may prosecute those individuals. Similarly, the United States Circuit Court for the First Circuit also considered
the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment in United States v. Bilodeau and likewise concluded that the Amendment does not prohibit federal
prosecution of persons and entities engaged in medical cannabis operations that violate state law. In that same opinion, however, the
Court concluded that strict compliance with the law is not necessary, such that technical noncompliance could not lead to
prosecution. 

Federal prosecutors have significant discretion
and no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where our borrowers operate will not choose to strictly
enforce the federal laws governing cannabis production, processing or distribution. Any change in the federal government s enforcement
posture with respect to state-licensed cannabis operators, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial
districts where our borrowers operate, would result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant
losses with respect to our investments, which would adversely affect the trading price of our securities. 

State Laws Applicable to the Cannabis Industry 

In most states that have legalized cannabis in
some form, the growing, processing and/or dispensing of cannabis generally requires that the operator obtain one or more licenses in
accordance with applicable state requirements. In addition, many states regulate various aspects of the growing, processing and/or dispensing
of cannabis. Local governments in some cases also impose rules and regulations on the manner of operating cannabis businesses. As
a result, applicable state and local laws and regulations vary widely, including, but not limited to, product testing, the level of enforcement
by state and local authorities on non-licensed cannabis operators, state and local taxation of regulated cannabis products, local municipality
bans on operations and operator licensing processes and renewals. 

There is no guarantee that state laws legalizing
and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed, amended or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will
not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends or
repeals the CSA with respect to medical and/or adult-use cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendment or repeal
there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law. If the federal government begins
to enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing applicable
state laws are repealed or curtailed, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely
affected. 

Laws Applicable to Financial Services for Cannabis Industry 

All banks are subject to federal law, whether
the bank is a national bank or state-chartered bank. At a minimum, all banks maintain federal deposit insurance which requires adherence
to federal law. Violation of federal law could subject a bank to loss of its charter. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated
by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter
statutes and the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks must report to the federal government any suspected
illegal activity, which would include any transaction associated with a cannabis-related business. These reports must be filed even though
the business is operating in compliance with applicable state and local laws. Therefore, financial institutions that conduct transactions
with money generated by cannabis-related conduct could face criminal liability under the Bank Secrecy Act for, among other things, failing
to identify or report financial transactions that involve the proceeds of cannabis-related violations of the CSA. 

11 

Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the
Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the 2014
FinCEN Memorandum outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance
with federal enforcement priorities. Concurrently with the FinCEN Memorandum, the DOJ issued supplemental guidance directing federal prosecutors
to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memo with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money
transmitter and Bank Secrecy Act offenses based on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. The FinCEN Memorandum sets forth extensive
requirements for financial institutions to meet if they want to offer bank accounts to cannabis-related businesses and echoed the enforcement
priorities of the Cole Memo. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report SAR in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money
laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis
terminated based on the financial institution s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside
of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. This is a level of scrutiny that is
far beyond what is expected of any normal banking relationship. 

As a result, many banks are hesitant to offer
any banking services to cannabis-related businesses, including opening bank accounts. While we currently maintain banking relationships,
our inability to maintain those accounts or the lack of access to bank accounts or other banking services in the future, would make it
difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges.
Similarly, if our borrowers are unable to access banking services, they will not be able to enter into loan agreements with us, as our
agreements require interest payments to be made by check or wire transfer. 

The rescission of the Cole Memo has not yet affected
the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN
Memorandum itself. Although the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, it is unclear whether the current administration will continue to follow
the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum. The DOJ continues to have the right and power to prosecute crimes committed by banks and financial
institutions, such as money laundering and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, that occur in any state including states that have in
some form legalized the sale of cannabis. Further, the conduct of the DOJ s enforcement priorities could change for any number
of reasons. A change in the DOJ s priorities could result in the DOJ s prosecuting banks and financial institutions for crimes
that were not previously prosecuted. 

The increased uncertainty surrounding financial
transactions related to cannabis activities may also result in financial institutions discontinuing services to the cannabis industry. 

Seasonality 

Our business has not been, and we do not expect
it to become subject to, material seasonal fluctuations. 

U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections
856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable period ended December 31, 2021. We believe that we have qualified as a REIT
and that our method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. 

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT,
we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders
annually. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation (i.e., at both the corporate and stockholder levels)
that typically results from investment in a corporation. 

Notwithstanding our qualification as a REIT,
we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as follows: 

we will be taxed at normal corporate rates on any undistributed net income (including undistributed
 net capital gains); 

if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or the 95 gross income tests (discussed below), but nonetheless
 maintain our qualification as a REIT because other requirements are met, we will be subject to a 100 tax on the greater of (1) the
 amount by which we fail the 75 test and (2) the amount by which we fail the 95 test, in either case, multiplied by a fraction intended
 to reflect our profitability; 

if we should fail to satisfy the asset tests or other requirements applicable to REITs, as described
 below, yet nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable
 requirements are met, we may be subject to an excise tax; 

12 

we will be subject to a tax of 100 on net income from any prohibited transaction 

we will be subject to tax, at the highest corporate rate, on net income from (1) the sale or other
 disposition of foreclosure property (generally, property acquired by us through foreclosure or after a default on a
 loan secured by the property or a lease of the property and for which an election is in effect) that is held primarily for sale to
 customers in the ordinary course of business or (2) other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property; 

if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (1) 85 of our REIT ordinary
 income for the year, (2) 95 of our REIT capital gain income for the year and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior years,
 we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the Required Distribution over the sum of (a) the amounts actually distributed
 plus (b) the amounts with respect to which certain taxes are imposed on us; 

if we acquire any asset from a C corporation (that is, a corporation generally subject
 to the full corporate level tax) in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the
 basis of the asset in the hands of the C corporation, and we recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during a five-year period
 beginning on the date that we acquired the asset, then the asset s built-in gain generally will be subject to
 tax at the highest regular corporate rate; 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT because we failed to distribute by the end of the
 relevant year any earnings and profits we inherited from a taxable C corporation during the year (e.g., by tax-free merger or
 tax-free liquidation), and the failure is not due to fraud with intent to evade tax, we generally may retain our REIT status
 by paying a special distribution, but we will be required to pay an interest charge on 50 of the amount of undistributed non-REIT earnings
 and profits; 

a 100 tax may be imposed on certain transactions between us and our taxable REIT subsidiaries
 TRSs that do not reflect arm s length terms; 

we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if
 we fail to satisfy the record keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the ownership of our
 common stock; 

certain of our subsidiaries, if any, may be C corporations, the earnings of which could be subject
 to federal corporate income tax; and 

we and our subsidiaries, if any, may be subject to a variety of taxes, including state and local
 income taxes, property taxes and other taxes on our assets and operations and could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions
 not presently contemplated. 

We will use the calendar year both for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes. 

Requirements for Qualification. To
qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must elect to be treated as a REIT and must meet various (a) organizational
requirements, (b) gross income tests, (c) asset tests and (d) annual distribution requirements. 

Organizational Requirements. A REIT must
be organized as a corporation, trust or association: 

(1) 
 that is managed by one or more trustees or directors; 

(2) 
 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates
 of beneficial interest; 

(3) 
 that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code; 

(4) 
 that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specified provisions
 of the Code; 

(5) 
 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; 

13 

(6) 
 at all times during the last half of each taxable year, after the first taxable year, not more
 than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, or by application of certain constructive ownership
 rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals 
 and 

(7) 
 that meets other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets. 

The Code provides that conditions (1) through
(4) must be met during our entire taxable year, and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of
12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. The Charter provides for restrictions regarding
transfer of our capital stock, in order to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and (6)
above. 

We will be treated as having satisfied condition
(6) above if we comply with the regulatory requirements to request information from our stockholders regarding their actual ownership
of our common stock, and we do not know, or in exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that we failed to satisfy this condition.
If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements for any taxable year we will be subject to a penalty of 25,000, or 50,000 if
such failure was intentional. However, if our failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalties will
be imposed. 

Gross Income Tests. We must satisfy the
following two separate gross income tests each year: 

75 Gross Income Test. At least 75 of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited
 transactions, income from certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains) must consist of income derived directly
 or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (generally including rents from real property,
 dividends from other REITs, and interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property),
 or some types of temporary investment income. 

95 Gross Income Test. At least 95 of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited
 transactions, income from certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains) must consist of items that satisfy the
 75 gross income test and certain other items, including dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities
 (or from any combination of these types of income). 

Interest income that we receive will satisfy
the 75 gross income test (as described above) to the extent that it is derived from a loan that is adequately secured by a mortgage
on real property or on interests in real property (including, in the case of a loan secured by both real property and personal property,
such personal property if it does not exceed 15 of the total fair market value of all of the property securing the loan). If a loan
is secured by both real property and other property (and such other property is not treated as real property as described above), and
the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing
the loan, determined as of (a) the date we agreed to acquire or originate the loan or (b) in the event of a significant modification, 
the date we modified the loan, then a part of the interest income from such loan equal to the percentage amount by which the loan exceeds
the value of the real property will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75 gross income test, but may be qualifying income
for purposes of the 95 gross income test. 

From time to time, we may invest in mezzanine
loans. The IRS has provided a safe harbor with respect to the treatment of a mezzanine loan as a loan and therefore as a qualifying asset
for purposes of the REIT asset tests, but not rules of substantive law. Pursuant to the safe harbor, if a mezzanine loan meets certain
requirements, it will be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived
from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75 income test. However, structuring
a mezzanine loan to meet the requirements of the safe harbor may not always be practical. To the extent that any of our mezzanine loans
do not meet all of the requirements for reliance on the safe harbor, such loans might not be properly treated as qualifying loans for
REIT purposes. 

If we receive contingent interest that is based
on the cash proceeds realized upon the sale of the property securing the loan, then the income attributable to the participation feature
will be treated as gain from the sale of the underlying real property and will satisfy both the 75 and 95 gross income tests provided
that the property is not held by the borrower as inventory or dealer property. Interest income that we receive from a loan in which all
or a portion of the interest income payable is contingent on the gross receipts or sales of the borrower will generally be qualifying
income for purposes of both the 75 and 95 gross income tests. 

14 

We may receive fee income in a number of circumstances,
including from loans that we originate. Fee income, including prepayment penalties, loan assumption fees and late payment charges that
are not compensation for services, generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75 and 95 gross income tests if it
is received in consideration for us entering or having entered into an agreement to make a loan secured by real property or an interest
in real property and the fees are not determined by income or profits of the borrower. Other fees generally are not qualifying income
for purposes of either gross income test. Fees earned by any TRSs are not included in computing the 75 and 95 gross income tests, and
thus neither assist nor hinder our compliance with these tests. 

Prohibited Transactions. Net income from
prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 tax. The term prohibited transaction generally includes a sale or other disposition
of property (other than foreclosure property) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
Whether property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the specific
facts and circumstances. The Code provides a safe harbor pursuant to which sales of assets held for at least two years and meeting certain
additional requirements will not be treated as prohibited transactions, but compliance with the safe harbor may not always be practical.
We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) will be treated as, or as having
been, held as inventory or for sale to customers and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary
course of our business. 

Effect of Subsidiary Entities. A
TRS is a corporation in which we directly or indirectly own stock and that jointly with us elects to be treated as our TRS under Section
856( l of the Code. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal income tax and state and local income tax, where applicable, as a regular
C corporation. Generally, a TRS can engage in activities that, if conducted by us other than through a TRS, could result in the receipt
of non-qualified income or the ownership of non-qualified assets. However, several provisions regarding the arrangements between
a REIT and its TRSs ensure that a TRS will be subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. For example, we will be
obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or certain other amounts or on certain expenses deducted by the
TRS if the economic arrangements among us, our borrowers and/or the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. 

We may own interests in one or more TRSs that
may receive management fee income and/or hold assets or generate income that could cause us to fail the REIT income or asset tests or
subject it to the 100 tax on prohibited transactions. Our TRSs may incur significant amounts of U.S. federal, state and local income
taxes and, if doing business or owning property outside of the United States, significant non-U.S. taxes. 

Relief Provisions for Failing the 75 or the
95 Gross Income Tests. If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless
qualify as a REIT for that year if we are entitled to relief under provisions of the Code. Relief provisions are generally available
if: 

following our identification of the failure to meet the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable
 year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests
 for such taxable year; and 

our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. 

However, it is not possible to state whether
in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. As discussed above, even if the relief provisions
apply, a tax will be imposed with respect to some or all of our excess nonqualifying gross income, reduced by approximated expenses. 

Asset Tests. We must satisfy the following
tests relating to the nature of our assets at the close of each quarter of our taxable year: 

at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (including
 (1) our allocable share of real estate assets held by partnerships in which we own an interest, (2) stock or debt instruments held
 for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of our stock offering or long-term (at least five years) debt offering,
 cash and government securities, (3) stock in other REITs and (4) certain mortgage-backed securities and loans); 

not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the
 75 asset class; 

15 

of the investments included in the 25 asset class, the value of any one issuer s securities
 owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets (unless the issuer is a TRS), and we may not own more than 10 of
 the vote or value of any one issuer s outstanding securities (unless the issuer is a TRS or we can avail ourselves of the rules
 relating to certain securities and straight debt summarized below); 

not more than 20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more
 TRS; and 

not more than 25 of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly
 offered REITs that are not secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property. 

The term securities generally includes
debt securities issued by a partnership or another REIT. However, straight debt securities and certain other obligations,
including loans to individuals or estates, certain specified loans to partnerships, certain specified rental agreements and securities
issued by REITs are not treated as securities for purposes of the 10 value asset test. Straight debt 
means a written unconditional promise to pay on demand or on a specified date a sum certain in cash if (i) the debt is not convertible,
directly or indirectly, into stock, (ii) the interest rate and interest payment dates are not contingent on profits, the borrower s
discretion, or similar factors (subject to certain specified exceptions), and (iii) the issuer is either not a corporation or partnership,
or the only securities of the issuer held by us, and certain of our TRSs, subject to a de minimis exception, are straight debt and other
specified assets. 

The above asset tests must be satisfied not only
on the date that we acquire securities in the applicable issuer, but also at the close of each quarter in which we acquire any security
or other property. After initially meeting the asset tests at the beginning of any quarter, we will not lose our REIT status if we fail
to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in the relative values of our assets. If the failure
to satisfy the asset tests results from the acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter, the failure can be cured by
a disposition of sufficient non-qualifying assets or acquisition of sufficient qualifying assets within 30 days after the close
of that quarter. Although we plan to take steps to ensure that we satisfy such steps for any quarter with respect to which retesting
is to occur, there can be no assurance that such steps will always be successful, or will not require a reduction in our overall interest
in an issuer. If we fail to cure the noncompliance with the asset tests within this 30-day period, we could fail to qualify as a
REIT. 

In certain cases, we may avoid disqualification
for any taxable year if we fail to satisfy the asset tests after the 30-day cure period. We will be deemed to have met certain of the
REIT asset tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets for such tests (i) does not exceed the lesser of (a) 1 of the total
value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or (b) 10,000,000, and (ii) we dispose of the non-qualifying assets
within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered. For violations due
to reasonable cause rather than willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above, we may avoid disqualification
as a REIT, after the 30-day cure period, by taking steps including (i) the disposition of sufficient assets to meet the asset test
within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered, (ii) paying a
tax equal to the greater of (a) 50,000 or (b) the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets,
and (iii) disclosing certain information to the IRS. If we fail the asset test and cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions,
we may fail to qualify as a REIT. 

Annual Distribution Requirements. We are
required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (i) the
sum of (a) 90 of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (b)
90 of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) the sum of specified items of noncash income. Dividends
must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return
for that year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after the declaration. To the extent that we do not distribute
all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 , but less than 100 , of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will be subject
to tax on the undistributed amount at regular ordinary and capital gains corporate tax rates, as applicable. We may designate all or
a portion of our undistributed net capital gains as being includable in the income of our stockholders as gain from the sale or exchange
of a capital asset. If so, the stockholders receive an increase in the basis of their stock in the amount of the income recognized. Stockholders
are also to be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the capital gains tax imposed on us on the undistributed amounts and
receive a corresponding decrease in the basis of their stock. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year
at least the sum of (1) 85 of our REIT ordinary income for that year, (2) 95 of our REIT capital gain net income for that year and
(3) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the Required Distribution
over the sum of (a) the amounts actually distributed and (b) the undistributed amounts on which certain taxes are imposed on us. We intend
to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy all annual distribution requirements. 

16 

From time to time, we may experience timing differences
between (1) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (2) the inclusion of that income and deduction
of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income. Further, from time to time, we may be allocated a share of net capital gain attributable
to the sale of depreciated property that exceeds our allocable share of cash attributable to that sale. Additionally, we may incur cash
expenditures that are not currently deductible for tax purposes. As such, we may have less cash available for distribution than is necessary
to meet our annual 90 distribution requirement or to avoid tax with respect to capital gain or the excise tax imposed on specified undistributed
income. To meet the 90 distribution requirement necessary to qualify as a REIT or to avoid tax with respect to capital gain or the excise
tax imposed on specified undistributed income, we may find it appropriate to arrange for short-term (or possibly long-term) borrowings
or to pay distributions in the form of taxable stock dividends (discussed immediately below) or engage in other potentially adverse transactions. 

Under some circumstances, we may be able to rectify
a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency dividends to stockholders in a later year,
which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a
REIT or taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends. However, we will be required to pay interest based upon the amount of any
deduction taken for deficiency dividends. 

Record Keeping Requirements. To elect
taxation as a REIT under applicable Treasury regulations, we must maintain records and request information from our stockholders designed
to disclose the actual ownership of our stock. We intend to comply with these requirements. 

Affiliated REITs. If
any REIT in which we acquire an interest fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, that failure could, depending on
the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to REITs, including the
requirement that REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10 of the securities of another corporation that is not
a REIT or a TRS, as further described above. 

Failure to Qualify as a REIT. If
we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year and the relief provisions do not
apply, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in
which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us, nor will we be required to make those distributions. If we fail to so qualify
and the relief provisions do not apply, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to
stockholders generally will be taxable at capital gain rates if certain minimum holding period requirements are met, and, subject to
specified limitations of the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Unless entitled to
relief under specific statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be
entitled to statutory relief. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act made significant structural
reforms to the financial services industry. For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, various federal agencies have promulgated, or
are in the process of promulgating, regulations with respect to various issues that may affect our Company. Certain regulations have
already been adopted and others remain under consideration by various governmental agencies, in some cases past the deadlines set in
the Dodd-Frank Act for adoption. It is possible that regulations that will be adopted in the future will apply to us or that existing
regulations that are currently not applicable to us will begin to apply to us as our business evolves. 

Investment Company Act 

We have not been and are not currently required to
be registered under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. 

Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company
Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing,
reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that
is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes
to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of the issuer s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government
securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40 test. Real estate mortgages are excluded from the
term investment securities. 

17 

We rely on the exception set forth in Section 3(c)(5) of the Investment
Company Act, which excludes from the definition of investment company [a]ny person who is not engaged in the business of issuing
redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged
in one or more of the following business . . . (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real
estate. The SEC generally requires that, for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5) to be available, at least 55 of an entity s
assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as qualifying interests, and
at least another 25 of the entity s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying interests or real estate-type interests (with
no more than 20 of the entity s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). We believe we qualify for the exemption under this section
and our current intention is to continue to focus on originating and investing in loans collateralized by real estate so that at least
55 of our assets are qualifying interests and no more than 20 of our assets are miscellaneous assets. However, if, in
the future, we do acquire assets that do not meet this test, we may qualify as an investment company and be required to
register as such under the Investment Company Act, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 

The Investment Company Act provides certain protections
and imposes certain restrictions on registered investment companies, none of which are currently applicable to us. Our governing documents
do not permit any transfer of shares of our common stock that would result in us becoming subject to regulation as an investment company.
If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation
with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons
(as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry
concentration, and other matters. 

Competition 

We operate in a competitive market for the origination
and acquisition of attractive lending opportunities. We compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, debt
funds, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, institutional investors,
investment banking firms, financial institutions, private equity and hedge funds, and other entities. Some of our competitors are substantially
larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several of our competitors, including other
REITs, have recently raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital and may have investment objectives that overlap
with our investment objective, which may create additional competition for lending and other investment opportunities. Some of our competitors
may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us or are only available to us on substantially
less attractive terms. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance
of an exclusion or exemption from the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or
different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more lending relationships
than we do. Competition may result in realizing fewer investments, higher prices, acceptance of greater risk, greater defaults, lower
yields or a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs. In addition, competition for attractive investments could delay the investment
of our capital. 

In the face of this competition, we have access
to our Manager s professionals and their financing industry expertise, which may provide us with a competitive advantage in competing
effectively for attractive investment opportunities and help us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential
investments. Although we believe our Manager s expertise and our flexible funding structure provide us with valuable competitive
advantages, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional
information concerning these competitive risks, see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy . 

Human Capital 

We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant
to the Management Agreement between our Manager and us. Our officers also serve as officers or employees of our Manager and/or its affiliates.
We do not have any employees. 

18 

Additional Information 

We file with or submit to
the SEC annual, quarterly, and current periodic reports, proxy statements and other information meeting the informational requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). This information is available on our website at www.investors.refi.reit.
 The information on our website is not deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. These documents also may be accessed
through the SEC s electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system via electronic means, including on the SEC s homepage,
which can be found at www.sec.gov . 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

An investment in our common stock involves
a high degree of risk and should be considered highly speculative. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider
the following risk factors, which address the material risks concerning our business and an investment in our common stock. If any of
the risks discussed below occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, funds from operations, internal rate of return, financial condition
and results of operations, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected, in which
case the value of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in
the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. 

Risk Factors Summary 

The following is a summary of the principal risks
and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and/or results of operations, and these adverse
impacts may be material. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed descriptions of the risks and uncertainties
included in this Item 1A below and you should read this summary together with those more detailed descriptions. These principal risk
and uncertainties relate to, among other things: 

Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy 

We were recently formed and have limited operating history, and may not be able to successfully
 operate our business, integrate new assets and/or manage our growth or to generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions
 to our stockholders. 

Competition for the capital that we provide may reduce the return of our loans, which could adversely
 affect our operating results and financial condition. 

We are externally managed by our Manager and our growth and success depends on our Manager, its
 key personnel and investment professionals, and our Manager s ability to make loans on favorable terms that satisfy our investment
 strategy and otherwise generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. If our Manager overestimates the yields or incorrectly prices
 the risks of our loans or if there are any adverse changes in our relationship with our Manager, we may experience losses. 

Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry and Related Regulations 

We provide loans to established companies operating in the cannabis industry, which involves significant
 risks, including the risk to our business of strict enforcement against our borrowers of the federal illegality of cannabis, and
 the lack of liquidity of such loans. As a result, we could lose all or part of any of our loans. 

Our ability to grow our business depends on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. New
 laws that are adverse to our borrowers may be enacted, and current favorable state or national laws or enforcement guidelines relating
 to cultivation, production and distribution of cannabis may be modified or eliminated in the future, which would impede our ability
 to grow our business under our current business plan and could materially adversely affect our business. 

19 

We will not own real estate as long as it is used in cannabis-related operations due to current
 statutory prohibitions and exchange listing standards, which may delay or limit our remedies in the event that any of our borrowers
 default under the terms of their mortgage loans with us. 

If we foreclose on properties securing our loans, we may have difficulty selling the properties
 due to the nature of specialized industrial cultivation/processing cannabis properties and the potentially limited number of high-quality operators
 for such properties, as well as for retail/dispensary cannabis properties. 

Certain assets of our borrowers may not be used as collateral or transferred to us due to applicable
 state laws and regulations governing the cannabis industry, and such restrictions could negatively impact our profitability. 

As a debt investor, we are often not in a position to exert influence on borrowers, and the stockholders
 and management of such companies may make decisions with which we disagree that could decrease the value of loans to such borrower. 

Risks Related to Sources of Financing Our Business 

Our growth depends on external sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 

Interest rate fluctuations could increase our financing costs, which could lead to a significant
 decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our loans. 

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 

There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager, including conflicts
 created by our Manager s compensation arrangements with us, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests
 of our stockholders. 

Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act may impose significant
 limits on our operations. Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the
 Investment Company Act. 

Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT 

Failure to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as
 a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders. 

We may incur significant debt, and our governing documents contain no limit on the amount of debt
 we may incur. 

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

We may in the future pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, including
 borrowings, offering proceeds or the sale of assets, which means we would have less funds available for investments or less income-producing assets,
 which may reduce your overall return. 

The value of our common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially. 

20 

Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy 

We were recently formed and have limited operating history,
and may not be able to operate our business successfully or to generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders. 

We were formed on March 30, 2021 and have
a limited operating history. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of loans to 22 different borrowers. We are subject to all
of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that we will not achieve our investment
objective and that the value of your investment could decline substantially. We cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our
business successfully or profitably, or implement our operating policies. Our ability to provide attractive returns to our stockholders
is dependent on our ability both to generate sufficient cash flow to pay our investors attractive distributions and to achieve capital
appreciation, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do either. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate
sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and make or sustain distributions to stockholders. Our limited resources
may also materially and adversely impact our ability to successfully implement our business plan. The results of our operations and the
implementation of our business plan depend on several factors, including the availability of opportunities to make loans, the availability
of adequate equity and debt financing, the federal and state regulatory environment relating to the cannabis industry (which are described
below under Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry and Related Regulations ), conditions in the financial
markets and economic conditions. 

Competition for the capital that we provide may reduce the return
of our loans, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 

We compete as an alternative financing provider
of debt financing to companies in the cannabis industry. Several competitors have recently entered the marketplace, and these competitors
may prevent us from making attractive loans on favorable terms. Our competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be able
to compete more effectively as a capital provider. In particular, larger companies may enjoy significant competitive advantages that
result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 

Additionally, some of our competitors may have
higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans, deploy more aggressive
pricing and establish more relationships than us. Our competitors may also adopt loan structures similar to ours, which would decrease
our competitive advantage in offering flexible loan terms. In addition, due to a number of factors (including, but not limited to, potentially
greater clarity and/or unification of the laws and regulations governing cannabis by states and the federal government, including through
federal legislation or descheduling of cannabis, which may, in turn, encourage additional federally-chartered banks to provide their
services to cannabis-related businesses), the number of entities and the amount of funds competing to provide suitable capital may increase,
resulting in loans with terms less favorable to investors. Moreover, we strategically benefit from the cannabis industry s currently
constrained access to U.S. capital markets and if such access is broadened, including if the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE and/or the Nasdaq Stock Market were to permit the listing of plant-touching cannabis companies in the U.S., the demand among U.S. cannabis
companies for private equity investments and debt financings, including our target loans, may materially decrease and could result in
our competing with financial institutions that we otherwise would not. Any of the foregoing may lead to a decrease in our profitability,
and you may experience a lower return on your investment. Increased competition in providing capital may also preclude us from making
those loans that would generate attractive returns to us. 

Our loans lack of liquidity may adversely affect our
business. 

Our existing portfolio includes, and our future
loans will likely include, loans for which no public market exists, which are less liquid than publicly traded debt securities and other
securities. Certain of our target investments such as secured loans, mezzanine and other loans (including participations) and preferred
equity, in particular, are also particularly illiquid due to a variety of factors, which may include a short life, potential unsuitability
for securitization and greater difficulty of recovery in the event of a default or insolvency by the company to which we have provided
a loan. The illiquidity of our loans may make it difficult for us to sell such loans if the need or desire arises. Further, applicable
laws and regulations restricting the ownership and transferability of loans to regulated cannabis companies in conjunction with many
parties not wishing to invest in cannabis businesses as a result of cannabis being federally illegal may make it difficult for us to
sell or transfer such loans to third parties. In addition, many of the loans we make, to the extent they constitute securities, will
not be registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in a prohibition against their transfer, sale, pledge or disposition
except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of, or otherwise in accordance with, those laws. As a result,
we may be unable to dispose of such loans in a timely manner or at all. If we are required and able to liquidate all or a portion of
our portfolio quickly, we could realize significantly less value than that which we had previously recorded for our loans and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to sell our assets at a profit in the future. Further, we may face other restrictions on our ability
to liquidate a loan in a company to the extent that we or our Manager have or could be attributed as having material, non-public information
regarding such company. Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions or changes
in our strategic plan may therefore be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

21 

Our real estate investments are subject to risks particular
to real property. These risks may result in a reduction or elimination of or return from an investment secured by a particular property. 

Real estate investments are subject to various
risks, including: 

acts of nature, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, which may result in
 uninsured losses; 

acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of such acts; 

adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions; 

changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related
 costs of compliance with laws and regulations and ordinances; 

costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions including, but not
 limited to, indoor mold; and 

the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses. 

If any of these or similar events occurs, it
may cause borrowers to default on their obligations to us and, thereby, reduce our return from an affected property or investment and
reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. 

All of our assets may be subject to recourse. 

All of our assets, including any investments
made by us and any funds held by us, may be available to satisfy all of our liabilities and other obligations. If we become subject to
a liability, parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to our assets generally and not be limited to any particular
asset, such as the asset representing the investment giving rise to the liability. 

Our existing portfolio is, and our future portfolio may be,
concentrated in a limited number of loans, which subjects us to an increased risk of significant loss if any asset declines in value
or if a particular borrower fails to perform as expected. 

Our existing portfolio is, and our future loans
may be, concentrated in a limited number of loans. If a significant loan to one or more companies fails to perform as expected, such
a failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, and the magnitude of such
effect could be more significant than if we had further diversified our portfolio. A consequence of this limited number of loans is that
the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of loans perform poorly, if we need to write
down the value of any one loan, if a loan is repaid prior to maturity and we are not able to promptly redeploy the proceeds and/or if
an issuer is unable to obtain and maintain commercial success. While we intend to diversify our portfolio of loans as we deem prudent,
we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification. As a result, our portfolio could be concentrated in relatively few loans and in
a limited number of borrowers. 

Our portfolio of loans is concentrated in certain
property types or in particular industries, such as cannabis, that are subject to higher risk of default, or secured by properties concentrated
in a limited number of geographic locations, economic and business downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset which
may result in defaults on a number of our loans within a short time period, which may reduce our net income and the value of our common
stock and accordingly reduce our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Further, since we focus on limited-license states, there
may be fewer, if any, buyers for a distressed property. Accordingly, we may not be able to receive the full value of the collateral if
we exercise our remedies under our loan in connection with a default. 

We may lend to multiple borrowers that share
a common sponsor. We do not have a limit on the amount of total gross offering proceeds that can be held by multiple borrowers that share
the same sponsor. We may face greater credit risk to the extent a large portion of our portfolio is concentrated in loans to multiple
borrowers that share the same sponsor.

Our existing portfolio contains loans to companies with operations
that are geographically concentrated in Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New
Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, and we will be subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in those
states and any other state in which we in the future have lending exposure. 

Our existing portfolio contains loans to companies
with operations that are geographically concentrated in Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri,
Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. While our investment strategy includes a focus on providing loans to companies
with operations in states that limit the number of cannabis license issuances in order to protect the value of our collateral, circumstances
and developments related to operations in these markets that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and
results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors: 

the development and growth of applicable state cannabis markets; 

the responsibility of complying with multiple and likely conflicting state and federal laws, including
 with respect to retail sale, distribution, cultivation and manufacturing of cannabis, licensing, banking, and insurance; 

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other laws; 

difficulties and costs of managing operations in certain locations; 

potentially adverse tax consequences; 

the impact of national, regional or state specific business cycles and economic instability; and 

access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain
 locations. 

We will not own real estate as long as it is used in cannabis-related
operations due to current statutory prohibitions and exchange listing standards, which may delay or limit our remedies in the event that
any of our borrowers default under the terms of their mortgage loans with us. 

Although we will have the contractual ability
to foreclose on, and take title to, the properties securing our mortgage loans upon a default by the borrower, we will not take title
to and own such real estate as long as it is used in cannabis-related operations due to current statutory prohibitions, including Section
856 of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (the CSA ), which relates to, among other things, the management
or control of properties that are used for the manufacturing, distributing or using of any controlled substances. Taking title to real
estate used in cannabis-related activities or owning equity in cannabis-related businesses would also violate NASDAQ listing requirements.
As a result, in the event of a borrower default, to the extent we determine that taking title to the underlying real estate is the optimal
method of maximizing recovery on the defaulted loan, we will be forced to evict the borrower from the real estate and engage a third
party to ensure all cannabis is removed from the subject property prior to taking possession. The regulatory requirements related to
real property used in cannabis-related operations may cause significant delays or difficulties in transferring a property to another
cannabis operator. In addition, any alternative uses of cannabis-related properties may be limited due to the specialized nature of the
facilities or may be less profitable than the cannabis-related operations, which would adversely affect the value of the collateral securing
our loans and could result in us selling the property at a loss. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

While we may instead pursue other remedies upon
any defaults by our borrowers, including forcing a sale of the property to another cannabis operator, pursuing a judicial foreclosure
and execution thereof through a sheriff s sale without taking title to the property or using the property for non-cannabis related
operations, there can be no assurances that such remedies will be as effective as us taking direct ownership of a property used in cannabis-related
operations. 

Loans to relatively new and/or small companies and companies
operating in the cannabis industry generally involve significant risks. 

We primarily provide loans to established companies
operating in the cannabis industry, but because the cannabis industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, some of these companies
may be relatively new and/or small companies. Loans to relatively new and/or small companies operating in the cannabis industry generally
involve a number of significant risks, including, but not limited to, the following: 

these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations,
 which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral securing our loan and a reduction in the likelihood of
 us realizing a return on our loan; 

they typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares
 than larger and more established businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions
 (including conditions in the cannabis industry), as well as general economic downturns; 

they typically depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore,
 the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on such borrower
 and, in turn, on us; 

there is generally less public information about these companies. Unless publicly traded, these
 companies and their financial information are generally not subject to the regulations that govern public companies, and we may be
 unable to uncover all material information about these companies, which may prevent us from making a fully informed lending decision
 and cause us to lose money on our loans; 

23 

they generally have less predictable
operating results and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive
position; 

we, our executive officers
and directors and our Manager may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our loans to
such borrowers and may, as a result, incur significant costs and expenses in connection with such litigation; 

changes in laws and regulations,
as well as their interpretations, may have a disproportionate adverse effect on their business, financial structure or prospects compared
to those of larger and more established companies; and 

they may have difficulty accessing
capital from other providers on favorable terms or at all. 

While none of the loans in our portfolio have defaulted
as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, there can be no assurance that we will not experience defaults in the future. 

If we are unable to successfully integrate new assets and manage
our growth, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. 

We may in the future significantly increase the
size and/or change the mix of our portfolio of assets. We may be unable to successfully and efficiently integrate new assets into our
existing portfolio or otherwise effectively manage our assets or our growth effectively. In addition, increases in our portfolio of assets
and/or changes in the mix of our assets may place significant demands on our Manager s administrative, operational, asset management,
financial and other resources. Any failure to manage increases in size effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. 

We may need to foreclose on loans that are in default, which
could result in losses. 

We may find it necessary to foreclose on loans that
are in default. Foreclosure processes are often lengthy and expensive. Results of foreclosure processes may be uncertain, as claims may
be asserted by the relevant borrower or by other creditors or investors in such borrower that interfere with enforcement of our rights,
such as claims that challenge the validity or enforceability of our loan or the priority or perfection of our security interests. Our borrowers
may resist foreclosure actions by asserting numerous claims, counterclaims and defenses against us, including, without limitation, lender
liability claims and defenses, even when the assertions may have no merit, in an effort to prolong the foreclosure action and seek to
force us into a modification or buy-out of our loan for less than we are owed. Additionally, the transfer of certain collateral to us
may be limited or prohibited by applicable laws and regulations. See We may make loans that are secured by properties that are,
and will be, subject to extensive regulations, such that if such collateral was foreclosed upon those regulations may result in significant
costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

For transferable collateral, foreclosure or other
remedies available may be subject to certain laws and regulations, including the need for regulatory disclosure and/or approval of such
transfer. If federal law were to change to permit companies in the cannabis industry to seek federal bankruptcy protection, the applicable
borrower could file for bankruptcy, which would have the effect of staying the foreclosure actions and delaying the foreclosure processes
and potentially result in reductions or discharges of debt owed to us. Foreclosure may create a negative public perception of the collateral
property, resulting in a diminution of its value. Even if we are successful in foreclosing on collateral property securing our loan, the
liquidation proceeds upon sale of the underlying real estate may not be sufficient to recover our loan. Any costs or delays involved in
the foreclosure or a liquidation of the underlying property will reduce the net proceeds realized and, thus, increase the potential for
loss. 

In the event a borrower defaults on any of its obligations
to us and such debt obligations are equitized, we do not intend to directly hold such equity interests, which may result in additional
losses on our loans in such entity. 

24 

The properties securing our loans may be subject to contingent
or unknown liabilities that could adversely affect the value of these properties, and as a result, our loans. 

Properties securing our loans may be subject to
contingent, unknown or unquantifiable liabilities that may adversely affect the value of our loans. Such defects or deficiencies may include
title defects, title disputes, liens or other encumbrances on properties securing our loans to borrowers. The discovery of such unknown
defects, deficiencies and liabilities could affect the ability of our borrowers to make payments to us or could affect our ability to
foreclose and sell the properties securing such loans, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Further, we, our executive officers, directors and our Manager may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation
arising from our loans. 

We may in the future foreclose and acquire properties
without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior property owner with respect to contingent or unknown liabilities.
As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these properties, we may have to pay substantial amounts
to defend or settle the claim. If the magnitude of such unknown liabilities is high, individually or in the aggregate, our business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 

Commercial real estate-related investments that are secured,
directly or indirectly, by real property are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us. 

Commercial real estate debt instruments that are
secured by commercial property are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks
associated with loans made on the security of single-family residential property. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by
an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than upon the existence
of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower s ability
to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of an income-producing property can be affected by, among other things: 

tenant mix and tenant bankruptcies; 

success of tenant businesses; 

property management decisions,
including with respect to capital improvements, particularly in older building structures; 

property location and condition; 

competition from other properties
offering the same or similar services; 

changes in laws that increase
operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; 

any liabilities relating to
environmental matters at the property; 

changes in national, regional
or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments; 

declines in national, regional
or local real estate values; 

declines in national, regional
or local rental or occupancy rates; 

changes in interest rates and
in the state of the debt and equity capital markets, including diminished availability or lack of debt financing for commercial real
estate; 

changes in real estate tax
rates and other operating expenses; 

changes in governmental rules,
regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation; 

acts of God, terrorism, social
unrest and civil disturbances, which may decrease the availability of or increase the cost of insurance or result in uninsured losses;
and 

adverse changes in zoning laws. 

25 

In addition, we are exposed to the risk of judicial
proceedings with our borrowers and entities in which we invest, including bankruptcy or other litigation, as a strategy to avoid foreclosure
or enforcement of other rights by us as a lender or investor. In the event that any of the properties or entities underlying or collateralizing
our loans or investments experiences any of the foregoing events or occurrences, the value of, and return on, such investments could decline
and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

If our Manager overestimates the yields or incorrectly prices
the risks of our loans, we may experience losses. 

Our Manager values our potential loans based on
yields and risks, taking into account estimated future losses and the collateral securing a potential loan, if any, and the estimated
impact of these losses on expected future cash flows, returns and appreciation. Our Manager s loss estimates and expectations of
future cash flows, returns and appreciation may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates and expectations. If our
Manager underestimates the asset-level losses or overestimates loan yields relative to the price we pay for a particular loan, we may
experience losses with respect to such loan. 

The due diligence process that our Manager undertakes in regard
to investment opportunities may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment and if our Manager incorrectly
evaluates the risks of our investments, we may experience losses. 

Before making investments for us, our Manager conducts
due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances relevant to each potential investment. When
conducting diligence, our Manager may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental
and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in
varying degrees depending on the type of potential investment. Relying on the resources available to it, our Manager evaluates our potential
investments based on criteria it deems appropriate for the relevant investment. Our Manager s loss estimates may not prove accurate,
as actual results may vary from estimates. If our Manager underestimates the asset-level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular
investment, we may experience losses with respect to such investment. 

In addition, it is difficult for real estate debt
investors in certain circumstances to receive full transparency with respect to underlying investments because transactions are often
effectuated on an indirect basis through pools or conduit vehicles rather than directly with the borrower. Loan structures or the terms
of investments may make it difficult for us to monitor and evaluate investments. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Manager will
have knowledge of all information that may adversely affect such investment. 

We are subject to additional risks associated with investments
in the form of loan participation interests. 

We may in the future invest in loan participation
interests in which another lender or lenders share with us the rights, obligations and benefits of a commercial mortgage loan made by
an originating lender to a borrower. Accordingly, we will not be in privity of contract with a borrower because the other lender or participant
is the record holder of the loan and, therefore, we will not have any direct right to any underlying collateral for the loan. These loan
participations may be senior, pari passu or junior to the interests of the other lender or lenders in respect of distributions
from the commercial mortgage loan. Furthermore, we may not be able to control the pursuit of any rights or remedies under the commercial
mortgage loan, including enforcement proceedings in the event of default thereunder. In certain cases, the original lender or another
participant may be able to take actions in respect of the commercial mortgage loan that are not in our best interests. In addition, in
the event that (1) the owner of the loan participation interest does not have the benefit of a perfected security interest in the lender s
rights to payments from the borrower under the commercial mortgage loan or (2) there are substantial differences between the terms of
the commercial mortgage loan and those of the applicable loan participation interest, such loan participation interest could be recharacterized
as an unsecured loan to a lender that is the record holder of the loan in such lender s bankruptcy, and the assets of such lender
may not be sufficient to satisfy the terms of such loan participation interest. Accordingly, we may face greater risks from loan participation
interests than if we had made first mortgage loans directly to the owners of real estate collateral. 

26 

Declines in market prices and liquidity in the capital markets
can result in significant net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio, which in turn would reduce our net asset value. 

Volatility in the capital markets can adversely
affect our loan valuations. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our loans are recorded as unrealized depreciation. The effect
of all of these factors on our portfolio can reduce our net asset value (and, as a result our asset coverage calculation) by increasing
net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized and/or unrealized losses,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The loans and other assets we will obtain may be subject to impairment
charges, and we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets. 

We will periodically evaluate the loans we obtain
and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based upon factors such as
market conditions, borrower performance and legal structure. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to
make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period
in which the impairment charge is recorded. 

Any credit ratings assigned to our loans will be subject to ongoing
evaluations and revisions, and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded. 

Some of our loans may be rated by rating agencies such as Moody s
Investors Service, Fitch Ratings, Standard Poor s, DBRS, Inc. or Realpoint LLC. Any credit ratings on our loans are subject
to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a
rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce
or withdraw, or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our loans in the future, the value of our loans could significantly
decline, which would adversely affect the value of our loan portfolio and could result in losses upon disposition or, in the case of our
loans, the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us. As of December 31, 2022, none of our loans were rated
by ratings agencies. 

27 

Mezzanine loans, B-Notes and other investments that are subordinated
or otherwise junior in an issuer s capital structure, such as preferred equity, and that involve privately negotiated structures
will expose us to greater risk of loss. 

We have in the past originated, and may in the future
originate or acquire, mezzanine loans, B-Notes and other investments that are subordinated or otherwise junior in an issuer s capital
structure, such as preferred equity, and that involve privately negotiated structures. To the extent we invest in subordinated debt or
mezzanine tranches of an entity s capital structure or preferred equity, such investments and our remedies with respect thereto,
including the ability to foreclose on any collateral securing such investments, will be subject to the rights of holders of more senior
tranches in the issuer s capital structure and, to the extent applicable, contractual intercreditor and/or participation agreement
provisions, which will expose us to greater risk of loss. 

As the terms of such loans and investments are subject
to contractual relationships among lenders, co-lending agents and others, they can vary significantly in their structural characteristics
and other risks. For example, the rights of holders of B-Notes to control the process following a borrower default may vary from transaction
to transaction. Further, B-Notes typically are secured by a single property and accordingly reflect the risks associated with significant
concentration. Like B-Notes, mezzanine loans are by their nature structurally subordinated to more senior property-level financings. If
a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or on debt senior to our loan, or if the borrower is in bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will
be satisfied only after the property-level debt and other senior debt is paid in full. As a result, a partial loss in the value of the
underlying collateral can result in a total loss of the value of the mezzanine loan. In addition, even if we are able to foreclose on
the underlying collateral following a default on a mezzanine loan, we would be substituted for the defaulting borrower and, to the extent
income generated on the underlying property is insufficient to meet outstanding debt obligations on the property, we may need to commit
substantial additional capital and/or deliver a replacement guarantee by a creditworthy entity, which could include us, to stabilize the
property and prevent additional defaults to lenders with existing liens on the property. 

Loans or investments involving international real estate-related
assets are subject to special risks that we may not manage effectively, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

Our investment guidelines permit investments in
non-U.S. assets, subject to the same guidelines as investments in U.S. assets. To the extent that we invest in non-U.S. real estate-related
assets, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international investment generally, including, among others: 

currency exchange matters,
including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency
to another; 

less developed or efficient financial markets than in the United States, which may lead to potential price volatility and relative illiquidity; 

the burdens of complying with international regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; 

changes in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact the returns on our investments; 

a less developed legal or regulatory environment, differences in the legal and regulatory environment or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance; 

political hostility to investments by foreign investors; 

higher inflation rates; 

higher transaction costs; 

difficulty enforcing contractual obligations; 

fewer investor protections; 

28 

potentially adverse tax consequences; or 

other economic and political risks. 

If any of the foregoing risks were to materialize,
they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While our investment guidelines permit investments in non-U.S.
real estate assets, as of December 31, 2022, none of our loans were made to non-U.S. borrowers. 

We may not have control over certain of our loans and investments. 

Our ability to manage our portfolio of loans and
investments may be limited by the form in which they are made. In certain situations, we may: 

acquire investments subject to rights of senior classes, special servicers or collateral managers under intercreditor, servicing agreements or securitization documents; 

pledge our investments as collateral for financing arrangements; 

acquire only a minority and/or a non-controlling participation in an underlying investment; 

co-invest with others through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, thereby acquiring non-controlling interests; or 

rely on independent third-party management or servicing with respect to the management of an asset. 

Therefore, we may not be able to exercise control
over all aspects of our loans or investments. Such financial assets may involve risks not present in investments where senior creditors,
junior creditors, servicers or third parties controlling investors are not involved. Our rights to control the process following a borrower
default may be subject to the rights of senior or junior creditors or servicers whose interests may not be aligned with ours. A partner
or co-venturer may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such asset, may have economic or business interests or
goals that are inconsistent with ours, or may be in a position to take action contrary to our investment objective. In addition, we may,
in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners or co-venturers. 

Our loans and investments expose us to risks associated with
debt-oriented real estate investments generally. 

We seek to invest primarily in debt investments
in or relating to real estate-related businesses, assets or interests. Any deterioration of real estate fundamentals generally, and in
the United States in particular, could negatively impact our performance, increase the default risk applicable to borrowers, and/or make
it relatively more difficult for us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Changes in general economic conditions will affect the
creditworthiness of borrowers and/or the value of underlying real estate collateral relating to our investments and may include economic
and/or market fluctuations, changes in environmental, zoning and other laws, casualty or condemnation losses, regulatory limitations on
rents, decreases in property values, changes in the appeal of properties to tenants, changes in supply and demand of real estate products,
fluctuations in real estate fundamentals, energy and supply shortages, various uninsured or uninsurable risks, natural disasters, changes
in government regulations (such as rent control), changes in real property tax rates and operating expenses, changes in interest rates,
changes in the availability of debt financing and/or mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or
impracticable, increased mortgage defaults, increases in borrowing rates, negative developments in the economy and/or real estate values
generally and other factors that are beyond our control. 

We cannot predict the degree to which economic conditions
generally, and the conditions for real estate debt investing in particular, will improve or decline. Any declines in the performance of
the U.S. and global economies or in the real estate debt markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. Market conditions relating to real estate debt investments have evolved since the global financial crisis that
began in 2008, which has resulted in a modification to certain loan structures and/or market terms. Any such changes in loan structures
and/or market terms may make it relatively more difficult for us to monitor and evaluate our loans and investments. 

29 

We may finance first mortgage loans, which may present greater
risks than if we had made first mortgages directly to owners of real estate collateral. 

Our portfolio may include first mortgage loan-on-loan
financings, which are loans made to holders of mortgage loans that are secured by commercial real estate. While we will have certain rights
with respect to the real estate collateral underlying a first mortgage loan, the holder of the commercial real estate first mortgage loans
may fail to exercise its rights with respect to a default or other adverse action relating to the underlying real estate collateral or
fail to promptly notify us of such an event, which would adversely affect our ability to enforce our rights. In addition, in the event
of the bankruptcy of the borrower under the first mortgage loan, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the holder of the commercial
real estate loan, or the assets of the holder of the commercial real estate loan may not be sufficient to satisfy our first mortgage loan
financing. Accordingly, we may face greater risks from our first mortgage loan financings than if we had made first mortgage loans directly
to owners of real estate collateral. 

Loans on properties in transition will involve a greater risk
of loss than conventional mortgage loans. 

We may invest in transitional loans to borrowers
who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition or rehabilitation of a property. The typical borrower under
a transitional loan has usually identified an undervalued asset that has been under-managed and/or is located in a recovering market.
If the market in which the asset is located fails to improve according to the borrower s projections, or if the borrower fails to
improve the quality of the asset s management and/or the value of the asset, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on
the asset to satisfy the transitional loan, and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our investment. 

In addition, borrowers usually use the proceeds
of a conventional mortgage to repay a transitional loan. Transitional loans therefore are subject to risks of a borrower s inability
to obtain permanent financing to repay the transitional loan. In the event of any default under transitional loans that may be held by
us, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the
mortgage collateral and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the transitional loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect
to these transitional loans, it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Our loans may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our
loans. 

The debt that we invest in is typically not initially
rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such loans were rated, they would generally be below investment grade (rated lower
than Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, lower than BBB- by Fitch Ratings or lower than BBB- 
by Standard Poor s Ratings Services), which under the guidelines established by these entities is an indication of having
predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the borrower s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Therefore,
certain of our loans may result in an above average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal. While the loans we invest in are
often secured, such security does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the terms of the loan,
or that the value of any collateral will be sufficient to allow us to recover all or a portion of the outstanding amount of such loan
should we be forced to enforce our remedies. 

Any distressed loans or investments we make, or loans and investments
that later become distressed, may subject us to losses and other risks relating to bankruptcy proceedings. 

Our loans and investments may include making distressed
investments from time to time (e.g., investments in defaulted, out-of-favor or distressed bank loans and debt securities) or may involve
investments that become non-performing following our acquisition thereof. Certain of our investments may include properties
that typically are highly leveraged, with significant burdens on cash flow and, therefore, involve a high degree of financial risk. During
an economic downturn or recession, loans or securities of financially or operationally troubled borrowers or issuers are more likely to
go into default than loans or securities of other borrowers or issuers. Loans or securities of financially or operationally troubled issuers
are less liquid and more volatile than loans or securities of borrowers or issuers not experiencing such difficulties. The market prices
of such securities are subject to erratic and abrupt market movements and the spread between bid and asked prices may be greater than
normally expected. Investment in the loans or securities of financially or operationally troubled borrowers or issuers involves a high
degree of credit and market risk. 

30 

In certain limited cases (e.g., in connection with
a workout, restructuring and/or foreclosing proceedings involving one or more of our investments), the success of our investment strategy
with respect thereto will depend, in part, on our ability to effectuate loan modifications and/or restructure and improve the operations
of the borrower entities. The activity of identifying and implementing successful restructuring programs and operating improvements entails
a high degree of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and implement successful restructuring programs
and improvements with respect to any distressed loans or investments we may have from time to time. 

These financial difficulties may not be overcome
and may cause borrower entities to become subject to bankruptcy or other similar administrative proceedings. There is a possibility that
we may incur substantial or total losses on our loans and investments and, in certain circumstances, become subject to certain additional
potential liabilities that may exceed the value of our original investment therein. For example, under certain circumstances, a lender
that has inappropriately exercised control over the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed
or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating
to our investments, we may lose our entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than our original
investment and/or may be required to accept different terms, including payment over an extended period of time. In addition, under certain
circumstances, payments to us may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance,
preferential payment, or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. Furthermore, bankruptcy laws and similar
laws applicable to administrative proceedings may delay our ability to realize on collateral for loan positions held by us, may adversely
affect the economic terms and priority of such loans through doctrines such as equitable subordination or may result in a restructuring
of the debt through principles such as the cramdown provisions of the bankruptcy laws. 

Construction loans involve an increased risk of loss. 

We may invest in construction loans. If we fail
to fund our entire commitment on a construction loan or if a borrower otherwise fails to complete the construction of a project, there
could be adverse consequences associated with the loan, including, but not limited to, a loss of the value of the property securing the
loan, especially if the borrower is unable to raise funds to complete it from other sources; a borrower s claim against us for failure
to perform under the loan documents; increased costs to the borrower that the borrower is unable to pay; a bankruptcy filing by the borrower;
and abandonment by the borrower of the collateral for the loan. 

Investments in construction loans require us to make estimates
about the fair value of land improvements that may be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service. 

We may invest in construction loans, the interest
from which would be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests applicable to REITs, provided that the loan value of the
real property securing the construction loan was equal to or greater than the highest outstanding principal amount of the construction
loan during any taxable year. For purposes of construction loans, the loan value of the real property is generally the fair value of the
land plus the reasonably estimated cost of the improvements or developments (other than personal property) that secure the loan and that
are to be constructed from the proceeds of the loan. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service IRS would
not challenge our estimates of the loan values of the real property. 

31 

We may in the future enter into credit
agreements with borrowers that may permit them to incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the loans we extend to such companies
under such credit agreements. 

As of December 31, 2022, all but one of our borrowers
were restricted from incurring any debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our loans. We have invested in one position with a principal
balance of approximately 25.5 million that is subordinated to other indebtedness of the borrowers, which comprises 7.5 of our total
assets. Although our intended investment strategy is to construct a portfolio of loans secured with first priority liens on certain
assets of our borrowers, we may in the future enter into credit agreements that rank equally with, or are subordinated to, other debt
of our borrowers or that otherwise permit our borrowers to incur other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our loans under such
credit agreements. In such case, such instruments may, by their terms, provide that the holders of such other debt are entitled to receive
payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our loans. These instruments
may prohibit borrowers from paying interest on or repaying our loans in the event and during the continuance of a default under such instrument
or upon the occurrence of other specified events. In certain cases, we may, and may continue to, obtain unsecured guarantees from the
parent entities or subsidiaries of our borrowers in addition to the collateral provided by such borrowers and such guarantees may be effectively
subordinated to any secured debt of any such entities and/or structurally subordinated to any debt of such subsidiaries. Also, in the
event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a borrower, holders of securities ranking senior to our
loan to that borrower, if any, typically are entitled to receive payment in full before we can receive any distribution in respect of
our loan. After repaying such holders, the borrower may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the
case of securities or other debt ranking equally with our loans, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other
security holders in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant borrower. 

Some of our borrowers may be highly leveraged. 

Some of our borrowers may be highly leveraged, which
may have adverse consequences to these companies and to us as a creditor. These companies may be subject to restrictive financial and
operating covenants and the leverage may impair these companies ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As
a result, these companies flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business
opportunities may be limited. Further, a leveraged company s income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater
rate than if borrowed money were not used. 

There may be circumstances in which our loans could be subordinated
to claims of other creditors, or we could be subject to lender liability claims. 

If one of our borrowers were to go bankrupt, depending
on the facts and circumstances, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our loan and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that
of other creditors. In addition, we could be subject to lender liability claims if we are deemed to be too involved in a borrower s
business or exercise control over such borrower. For example, we could become subject to a lender s liability claim if, among other
things, we actually render significant managerial assistance to a borrower to which we have provided a loan. 

As a debt investor, we are often not in a position to exert influence
on borrowers, and the stockholders and management of such companies may make decisions with which we disagree and/or that could decrease
the value of loans to such borrower. 

As a debt investor, we are subject to the risk that
a borrower may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of such company may take risks or otherwise
act in ways that do not serve our interests. As a result, or due to other factors, a borrower may make decisions that could decrease the
value of our loan to such borrower. 

Due to our borrowers involvement in the regulated cannabis
industry, we currently do not have any insurance coverage. We and our borrowers have, and may continue to have, a difficult time obtaining
or maintaining the various insurance policies that are desired to operate our business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial
liabilities. 

Insurance that is otherwise readily available, such
as workers compensation, general liability, title insurance and directors and officers insurance, is more difficult
for us and our borrowers to find and more expensive, because of our borrowers involvement in the regulated cannabis industry. We
currently do not have any insurance coverage. There are no guarantees that we or our borrowers will be able to find insurance now or in
the future, or that such insurance will be available on economically viable terms. As a result, this may prevent us from entering into
certain business sectors, may inhibit our growth, may expose us to additional risk and financial liabilities and, in the case of an uninsured
loss, may result in the loss of anticipated cash flow or the value of our loan. 

32 

We do not currently have catastrophic insurance policies. 

There are certain types of losses, generally of
a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, which may be uninsurable or not economically
insurable. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, including terrorism or
acts of war, also might result in insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace an asset if it is damaged or destroyed. We do not
currently have insurance policies to protect us from the type of losses described above or restore our economic position with respect
to any of our loans. Any uninsured loss could result in the loss of anticipated cash flow from, and the asset value of, the affected asset
and the value of our loan related to such asset. In addition, we do not currently carry directors and officers insurance. 

Subject to the approval of our Manager, our Board (which must
include a majority of our independent directors) may change our investment strategies or guidelines, financing strategies or leverage
policies without the consent of our stockholders. 

Subject to the approval of our Manager, our Board
(which must include a majority of our independent directors) may change our investment strategies or guidelines, financing strategies
or leverage policies with respect to loans, originations, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions
at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in a loan portfolio with a different risk profile than that of
our existing portfolio or of a portfolio comprised of our target loans. A change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure
to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market and cannabis industry fluctuations. Furthermore, a change in our asset allocation
could result in our making loans in asset categories different from those described in this annual report on Form 10-K. These changes
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our equity and our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders. 

To the extent OID and PIK-interest constitute a portion of our
income, we are exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior
to receipt of cash representing such income. 

Our investments include original-issue-discount
instruments and contractual PIK-interest arrangements. To the extent OID or PIK-interest constitutes a portion of our income, we are exposed
to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash,
including the following: 

The higher interest rates of OID and PIK instruments reflect the payment deferral, which results in a higher principal amount at the maturity of the instrument as compared to the original principal amount of the instrument, and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and OID and PIK instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. 

Even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is supposed to occur at the maturity of the obligation. 

OID and PIK instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. OID and PIK-income may also create uncertainty about the source of our cash distributions. 

To the extent we provide loans with interest-only payments or moderate loan amortization, the majority of the principal payment or amortization of principal may be deferred until loan maturity. Because this debt generally allows the borrower to make a large lump-sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. 

For accounting purposes, any cash distributions to stockholders representing OID and PIK-income are not treated as coming from paid-in capital, even though the cash to pay them comes from the offering proceeds. 

In certain cases, our taxable
 income may exceed our net cash provided by operating activities, as a result, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution
 requirement necessary to maintain our tax treatment as a REIT. 

33 

We may pay our Manager an incentive fee on certain investments
that include a deferred interest feature. 

We underwrite our loans to generally include an
end-of-term payment, a PIK interest payment and/or OID. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the
maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are generally a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan.
The portion of our end-of-term payments which equal the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan
are recognized as non-cash income or OID until they are paid. 

We may have difficulty paying our required distributions under
applicable tax rules if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income. 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be
required to include in income certain amounts before our receipt of the cash attributable to such amounts, such as OID or PIK interest,
which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. For example, such OID or increases
in loan balances as a result of PIK interest will be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. Also, we may
be required to include in income other amounts that we will not receive in cash, including, for example, non-cash income from PIK securities,
deferred payment securities and hedging and foreign currency transactions. In addition, we intend to seek debt investments in the secondary
market that represent attractive risk-adjusted returns, taking into account both stated interest rates and current market discounts to
par value. Such market discount may be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. 

Since we may recognize income before or without
receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the U.S. federal income tax requirement to distribute generally
an amount equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to maintain our status as a REIT. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of
our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations
to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a REIT and thus
be subject to additional corporate-level taxes. However, in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement for a REIT, we may, but
have no current intention to, declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion
of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20 of such dividend) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution
will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

We may expose ourselves to risks associated with the inclusion
of non-cash income prior to receipt of cash. 

To the extent we invest in OID instruments, including
PIK loans and zero coupon bonds, investors will be exposed to the risks associated with the inclusion of such non-cash income in taxable
and accounting income prior to receipt of cash. 

The deferred nature of payments on PIK loans creates
specific risks. Interest payments deferred on a PIK loan are subject to the risk that the borrower may default when the deferred payments
are due in cash at the maturity of the loan. Since the payment of PIK income does not result in cash payments to us, we may also have
to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment
originations (and thus hold higher cash balances, which could reduce returns) to pay our expenses or make distributions to stockholders
in the ordinary course of business, even if such loans do not default. An election to defer PIK interest payments by adding them to principal
increases our gross assets and, thus, increases future base management fees to the Manager. The deferral of interest on a PIK loan increases
its loan-to-value ratio, which is a measure of the riskiness of a loan. 

More generally, market prices of OID instruments
are more volatile because they are impacted to a greater extent by interest rate changes than instruments that pay interest periodically
in cash. 

Additionally, we will be required under the tax
laws to make distributions of non-cash income to stockholders without receiving any cash. Such required cash distributions may have to
be paid from the sale of our assets without investors being given any notice of this fact. The required recognition of non-cash income,
including PIK and OID interest, for U.S. federal income tax purposes may have a negative impact on liquidity because it represents a non-cash
component of our taxable income that must, nevertheless, be distributed to investors to avoid us being subject to corporate level taxation. 

34 

Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations, including
laws and regulations governing cannabis and REITs, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations and any
failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact
our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. 

We are subject to laws and regulations at the local,
state and federal levels, including laws and regulations governing cannabis and REITs by state and federal governments. These laws and
regulations, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. We cannot predict
the nature and timing of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or their potential effect. However, any change in
these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with
current or new laws or regulations or such changes thereto, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact
our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. 

We may not be able to obtain or maintain required licenses and
authorizations to conduct our business and may fail to comply with various state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our business. 

In general, lending is a highly regulated industry
in the United States and we are required to comply with, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act of 1974 (the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act ), regulations
promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, various laws, rules and regulations related to the cannabis industry and U.S. federal
and state securities laws and regulations. In addition, certain states have adopted laws or regulations that may, among other requirements,
require licensing of lenders and financiers, prescribe disclosures of certain contractual terms, impose limitations on interest rates
and other charges, and limit or prohibit certain collection practices and creditor remedies. 

There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain,
maintain or renew any required licenses or authorizations to conduct our business or that we would not experience significant delays in
obtaining these licenses and authorizations. As a result, we could be delayed in conducting certain business if we were first required
to obtain certain licenses or authorizations or if renewals thereof were delayed. Furthermore, once licenses are issued and authorizations
are obtained, we are required to comply with various information reporting and other regulatory requirements to maintain those licenses
and authorizations, and there is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy those requirements or other regulatory requirements applicable
to our business on an ongoing basis, which may restrict our business and could expose us to penalties or other claims. 

Any failure to obtain, maintain or renew required
licenses and authorizations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements that are applicable to our business could result in material
fines and disruption to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results
and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

35 

The long-term macroeconomic effects of any
current or future global health pandemics could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of
operations. 

The long-term macroeconomic effects of any current
or future global health pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our and our borrowers business, financial condition
and results of operations. While many of the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have eased, the longer-term macroeconomic effects
on global supply chains, inflation, labor shortages and wage increases continue to impact many industries, including the regulated cannabis
industry. Moreover, with the potential for new strains of existing viruses to emerge, or other pandemics or epidemics, governments and
businesses may re-impose aggressive measures to help slow its spread in the future. 

Long-term macroeconomic effects from a pandemic
or epidemic may have a material adverse effect on our and our borrowers business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows, due to, among other factors: 

a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our borrowers locations resulting from government or such company s actions; 

the temporary inability of consumers and patients to purchase our borrowers cannabis products due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, illness, dispensary closures or limitations on operations, quarantine, financial hardship, and stay at home orders; 

difficulty accessing equity and debt capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations and our borrowers ability to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us; 

workforce disruptions for our borrowers, as a result of infections, quarantines, stay at home orders or other factors, could result in a material reduction in our borrowers cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and/or sales capacity; 

because of the federal regulatory uncertainty relating to the regulated cannabis industry, our borrowers have not been, and in the future likely will not be eligible, for financial relief available to other businesses; 

restrictions on public events for the regulated cannabis industry limit the opportunity for our borrowers to market and sell their products and promote their brands; 

delays in construction at the properties of our borrowers may adversely impact their ability to commence operations and generate revenues from projects; 

a general decline in business activity in the regulated cannabis industry would adversely affect our ability to grow our portfolio of loans to companies in the cannabis industry; and 

the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, would result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption. 

The full extent of the impact and effects of COVID-19,
and any future pandemics or epidemics, will depend on future developments, including, among other factors, how rapidly variants develop,
availability, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines along with related travel advisories, quarantines and restrictions, the recovery
time of the disrupted supply chains and industries, the impact of labor market interruptions, the impact of government interventions,
and uncertainty with respect to the duration of the global economic slowdown. COVID-19, or any future pandemics or epidemics, and
resulting impacts on the financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present
uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry and Related Regulations 

Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, and therefore, strict
enforcement of federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to execute our business plan. 

Cannabis, other than hemp, is a Schedule I controlled
substance under the CSA. Even in states or territories that have legalized cannabis to some extent, the cultivation, possession and sale
of cannabis all remain violations of federal law that are punishable by imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Moreover, individuals
and entities may violate federal law if they aid and abet another in violating these federal controlled substance laws, or conspire with
another to violate them, and violating the federal cannabis laws is a predicate for certain other crimes under the anti-money laundering
laws or The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Monitoring our compliance with these laws is a critical component of our
business. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government has the authority to regulate and criminalize the sale, possession
and use of cannabis, even for individual medical purposes, regardless of whether it is legal under state law. 

For several years, the U.S. government has not enforced
those laws against cannabis companies complying with state law and their vendors. We would likely be unable to execute our business plan
if the federal government were to reverse its long-standing hands-off approach to the state legal cannabis markets, described below, and
start strictly enforcing federal law regarding cannabis. 

On January 4, 2018, then acting U.S. Attorney
General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the Sessions Memo rescinding certain past DOJ memoranda
on cannabis law enforcement, including the Memorandum by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole (the Cole Memo issued on August 29, 2013, under President Obama s administration. Describing the criminal enforcement of federal cannabis
prohibitions against those complying with state cannabis regulatory systems as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial
resources, the Cole Memo identified a list of federal enforcement priorities, including preventing interstate diversion or distribution
of cannabis to minors, to focus enforcement efforts against operations that implicated these priorities. The Sessions Memo, which remains
in effect, states that each U.S. Attorney s Office should follow established principles that govern all federal prosecutions when
deciding which cannabis activities to prosecute. As a result, federal prosecutors could and still can use their prosecutorial discretion
to decide to prosecute even state-legal cannabis activities. Since the Sessions Memo was issued over five years ago, however, U.S. Attorneys
have not prosecuted state law compliant entities. 

Former Attorney General
William Barr testified in his confirmation hearing on January 15, 2019, that he would not upset settled expectations, 
 investments, or other reliance interest[s] arising as a result of the Cole Memo, and that he does not intend
to use federal resources to enforce federal cannabis laws in states that have legalized cannabis to the extent people are complying
with the state laws. He stated: My approach to this would be not to upset settled expectations and the reliance interest
that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum and investments have been made and so there has been reliance on it, so I don t
think it s appropriate to upset those interests. He also implied that the CSA s prohibitions of cannabis may be null
in states that have legalized cannabis: [T]he current situation is almost like a back door nullification of federal law. 
Industry observers generally have not interpreted Attorney General Barr s comments to suggest that the DOJ would proceed with cases
against participants who entered the state-legal industry after the Cole Memo had been rescinded. 

President Biden, at the time he won the Democratic Party nomination
for President, affirmed that his administration would seek to [d]ecriminalize marijuana use and legalize marijuana for medical
purposes at the federal level allow states to make their own decisions about legalizing recreational use and automatically
expunge all past marijuana convictions for use and possession. While his promise to decriminalize marijuana likely would mean that
the federal government would not criminally enforce the Schedule II status against state legal entities, the implications are not entirely
clear. Although the U.S. Attorney General could order federal prosecutors not to interfere with cannabis businesses operating in compliance
with states laws, the President alone cannot legalize medical cannabis, and as states have demonstrated, legalizing medical cannabis
can take many different forms. Although President Biden issued a proclamation in October 2022 asking the Secretary of Health and Human
Services and the Attorney General to review expeditiously . . . how marijuana is scheduled under federal law, the agencies
have not released a formal update on their progress. Even in an expedited format, the re- or descheduling process could take months, or
even years. A total de-scheduling of cannabis is unlikely, but entirely removing it from the schedule under the Controlled Substances
Act would similarly eliminate the money laundering and aiding-and-abetting risks currently posed by providing financial services to cannabis
businesses. Rescheduling cannabis to CSA Schedule II would ease certain research restrictions, it would not make the state medical or
adult use programs federally legal. Additionally, President Biden has not appointed any known proponents of cannabis legalization to the
Office of National Drug Control Policy transition team. Furthermore, while industry observers are hopeful that changes in Congress, along
with a Biden presidency, will increase the chances of banking reform, such as the SAFE Banking Act, we cannot provide assurances that
a bill legalizing cannabis would be approved by Congress. 

37 

Federal prosecutors have significant discretion,
and no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where we make a loan will not choose to strictly enforce
the federal laws governing cannabis manufacturing or distribution. Any change in the federal government s enforcement posture with
respect to state-licensed cultivation of cannabis, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial districts
where we make our loans, would result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant losses with
respect to our loans to cannabis industry participants in the United States, which would adversely affect our operations, cash flow and
financial condition. 

We believe that the basis for the federal government s perceived
d tente with the cannabis industry extends beyond the strong public sentiment and ongoing prosecutorial discretion. Since 2014,
versions of the U.S. omnibus spending bill have included a provision prohibiting the DOJ, which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration,
from using appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. In United States v. McIntosh ,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds to prosecute individuals
who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. The court noted
that, if the provision were not continued, prosecutors could enforce against conduct occurring during the statute of limitations even
while the provision were previously in force. Similarly, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit also considered the provision
in United States v. Bilodeau and likewise concluded that the provision does not prohibit federal prosecution of persons and entities
engaged in medical cannabis operations that violate state law. In that same opinion, however, the Court concluded that strict 
compliance with the law is not necessary, such that technical noncompliance could not lead to prosecution. Other courts that have considered
the issue have ruled similarly, although courts disagree about which party bears the burden of proof of showing compliance or noncompliance
with state law. 

Our loans do not prohibit our borrowers from engaging
in the cannabis business for adult-use that is permissible under state and local laws. Consequently, certain of our borrowers currently
(and may in the future) cultivate adult-use cannabis with the proceeds of our loans, if permitted by such state and local laws now or
in the future. This could subject our borrowers to greater and/or different federal legal and other risks as compared to businesses where
cannabis is cultivated exclusively for medical use, which could materially adversely affect our business. 

Our ability to grow our business depends on current state laws
pertaining to the cannabis industry. New laws that are adverse to our borrowers may be enacted at the federal or state level, and current
favorable state or national laws or enforcement guidelines relating to cultivation, production and distribution of cannabis may be modified
or eliminated in the future, which would impede our ability to grow our business under our current business plan and could materially
adversely affect our business. 

Continued development of the cannabis industry depends
upon continued legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level, along with no significant adverse regulatory efforts at the federal
level. The status quo of, or progress in, the regulated cannabis industry, while encouraging, is not assured and any number of factors
could slow or halt further progress in this area. While there may be ample public support for legislative action permitting the manufacture
and use of cannabis, numerous factors impact and can delay the legislative and regulatory processes. For example, many states that legalized
medical-use and/or adult-use cannabis have seen significant delays in the drafting and implementation of industry regulations and issuance
of licenses. In addition, burdensome regulations at the state level could slow or stop further development of the medical-use and/or adult-use
cannabis industry, such as limiting the medical conditions for which medical-use cannabis can be recommended, restricting the form in
which medical-use or adult-use cannabis can be consumed, or imposing significant taxes on the growth, processing and/or retail sales of
cannabis, each of which could have the impact of dampening growth of the cannabis industry and making it difficult for cannabis businesses,
including our borrowers, to operate profitably in those states. Any one of these factors could slow or halt additional legislative authorization
of cannabis, which could harm our business prospects. 

FDA regulation of cannabis could negatively affect the cannabis
industry, which would directly affect our financial condition. 

Should the federal government legalize cannabis
for adult-use and/or medical-use, it is possible that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA may have some role
in regulating certain cannabis product. Indeed, after the U.S. government removed hemp and its extracts from the CSA as part of the Agriculture
Improvement Act of 2008, then FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement reminding the public of the FDA s continued authority
 to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD C
Act and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. He also reminded the public that it s unlawful under
the FD C Act to introduce food containing added cannabidiol CBD or tetrahydrocannabinol THC into interstate
commerce, or to market CBD or THC products, as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived, 
and regardless of whether health claims are made, because CBD and THC entered the FDA testing pipeline as the subject of public substantial
clinical investigations for GW Pharmaceuticals Sativex (THC and CBD) and Epidiolex (CBD). The memo added that, prior to introduction
into interstate commerce, any cannabis product, whether derived from hemp or otherwise, marketed with a disease claim (e.g., therapeutic
benefit, disease prevention, etc.) must first be approved by the FDA for its intended use through one of the drug approval pathways. Notably,
the FDA can look beyond the product s express claims to find that a product is a drug. The definition of drug 
under the FDCA includes, in relevant part, articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
of disease in man or other animals as well as articles intended for use as a component of [a drug as defined in the other
sections of the definition]. 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1). In determining intended use, the FDA has traditionally
looked beyond a product s label to statements made on websites, on social media, or orally by the company s representatives. 

38 

While the FDA has not yet enforced against the cannabis
industry, it has sent numerous warning letters to sellers of CBD products making health claims. The FDA could turn its attention to the
cannabis industry. In addition to requiring FDA approval of cannabis products marketed as drugs, the FDA could issue rules and regulations
including certified good manufacturing practices related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of cannabis. It is also
possible that the FDA would require that facilities where cannabis is grown register with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed
regulations. Cannabis facilities are currently regulated by state and local governments. In the event that some or all of these federal
enforcement and regulations are imposed, we do not know what the impact would be on the cannabis industry, including what costs, requirements
and possible prohibitions may be enforced. If we or our borrowers are unable to comply with the regulations or registration as prescribed
by the FDA, we and/or our borrowers may be unable to continue to operate our and their business in its current form or at all. 

We and our borrowers may have difficulty accessing the service
of banks and other financial institutions, and we may be limited in our ability to provide debt to participants in the cannabis industry,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

Certain financial transactions involving proceeds
from the trafficking of cannabis can form a basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter
statute and the Bank Secrecy Act. Previous guidance issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a division of the U.S. Department
of the Treasury, clarified how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations
under the Bank Secrecy Act. While the federal government has not initiated financial crimes prosecutions against state-law compliant cannabis
companies or their vendors, the government theoretically could, at least against companies in the adult-use markets. The continued uncertainty
surrounding financial transactions related to cannabis activities may result in financial institutions discontinuing services to the cannabis
industry or limit our ability to provide loans to the cannabis industry. 

Consequently, those businesses involved in the regulated
cannabis industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships, which could increase over time. Our inability to
maintain our current bank accounts or service our lending relationships would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase
our operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges and could result in our inability to implement
our business plan. 

The terms of our loans require that our borrowers
make payments on such loans via check, ACH, or wire transfer. Only a small percentage of financial institutions in the United States currently
provide banking services to licensed companies operating in the cannabis industry. The inability of our current and potential borrowers
to open accounts and continue using the services of banks will limit their ability to enter into debt arrangements with us or may result
in their default under our debt agreements, either of which could materially harm our business, operations, cash flow and financial condition. 

Laws and regulations affecting the regulated cannabis industry
are continually changing, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, and we cannot predict the impact that future
regulations may have on us. 

Local, state and federal cannabis laws and regulations
have been evolving rapidly and are subject to varied interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with
compliance or alter our business plan and could negatively impact our borrowers or prospective borrowers, which in turn could negatively
impact our business. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed
business. We can know neither the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications nor the effect additional governmental
regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. For example, if cannabis is
no longer illegal under federal law, we may experience a significant increase in competition. Accordingly, any change in these laws or
regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with these laws or
regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition,
impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. 

39 

Applicable state laws may prevent us from maximizing our potential
income. 

Depending on the state, and the laws of that particular
state, we may not be able to fully realize our potential to generate profit. For example, some states have residency requirements for
those directly involved in the cannabis industry, which may impede our ability to contract with cannabis businesses in those states. Furthermore,
cities and counties are being given broad discretion to ban certain cannabis activities. Even if these activities are legal under state
law, specific cities and counties may ban them. 

Loans to cannabis businesses may be forfeited to the federal
government. 

Any assets used in conjunction with the violation
of federal law are potentially subject to federal forfeiture, even in states that have legalized cannabis. In July 2017, the DOJ issued
a new policy directive regarding asset forfeiture, referred to as the equitable sharing program. This policy directive represents
a reversal of DOJ s policy under President Obama s administration, and allows for forfeitures to proceed that are not in accord
with the limitations imposed by state-specific forfeiture laws. This policy directive could lead to increased use of asset forfeitures
by local, state and federal enforcement agencies. If the federal government decides to initiate forfeiture proceedings against cannabis
businesses, such as the cannabis facilities that are owned or utilized by our borrowers, our loans to our borrowers would likely be materially
and adversely affected. 

We may have difficulty accessing bankruptcy courts. 

Because cannabis is illegal under federal law, federal
bankruptcy protection is currently not available to parties who engage in the cannabis industry or cannabis-related businesses. Recent
bankruptcy rulings have denied bankruptcies for dispensaries upon the justification that businesses cannot violate federal law and then
claim the benefits of federal bankruptcy for the same activity and upon the justification that courts cannot ask a bankruptcy trustee
to take possession of, and distribute cannabis assets as such action would violate the CSA. Therefore, we may not be able to seek the
protection of the bankruptcy courts, and this could materially affect our business or our ability to obtain credit. 

The loans we make may include Canadian entities within their
corporate structure that have the ability to seek insolvency protections in Canada, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 

The loans that we make may include U.S.-based companies
operating in the cannabis industry with at least one Canadian entity within their corporate structure for the purpose of listing on the
CSE. In May 2020, a U.S.-based cannabis company that is listed on the CSE filed for, and was granted, insolvency protection under the
Companies Creditors Arrangement Act pursuant to Canadian law. If the applicable borrower obtains bankruptcy protections in Canada,
it could restrict our ability, or create additional costs or delays involved in our efforts, to foreclose on the collateral, which will
reduce the net proceeds realized and, thus, increase the potential for loss. 

We may make loans that are secured by properties that are, and
will be, subject to extensive regulations, such that if such collateral was foreclosed upon those regulations may result in significant
costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

We may make loans that are secured by properties
that are, and will be, subject to various local laws and regulatory requirements, and we would be subject to such requirements if such
collateral was foreclosed upon. Local property regulations may restrict the use of collateral or our ability to foreclose on the collateral.
Among other things, these restrictions may relate to cultivation of cannabis, the use of water and the discharge of wastewater, fire and
safety, seismic conditions, asbestos-cleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements. Due to current statutory prohibitions and exchange
listing standards, we will not own any real estate used in cannabis-related operations. While our loan agreements and related mortgages
provide for foreclosure remedies, receivership remedies and/or other remedies that would allow us to cause the sale or other realization
of real property collateral, the regulatory requirements and statutory prohibitions related to real property used in cannabis-related
operations may cause significant delays or difficulties in realizing upon the expected value of such real property collateral. We make
no assurance that existing regulatory policies will not materially and adversely affect the value of such collateral, or that additional
regulations will not be adopted that would increase such potential material adverse effect. The negative effect on such collateral could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

40 

If we foreclose on properties securing our loans, we may have
difficulty selling the properties due to the nature of specialized industrial cultivation/processing cannabis properties and the potentially
limited number of high-quality operators for such properties, as well as for retail/dispensary cannabis properties. 

Specialized industrial cultivation/processing cannabis
properties are highly specialized and require substantial investment to make them suitable for such uses. In addition, there may be a
limited number of high-quality operators of specialized industrial cultivation/processing and retail/dispensary cannabis properties or
a limited number of operators in a particular market that have completed the state-licensing process. As a result, if we foreclose on
properties securing our loans, we may have difficulty selling such properties and may be forced to sell a property to a lower quality
operator. To the extent there is a change in law or we are unable to find a suitable cannabis operator, we may be forced to sell a property
at a loss to a party outside of the cannabis industry. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect the value of our assets
and our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. 

Certain assets of our borrowers may not be used as collateral
or transferred to us due to applicable state laws and regulations governing the cannabis industry, and such restrictions could negatively
impact our profitability. 

Each state that has legalized cannabis in some form
has adopted its own set of laws and regulations that differ from one another. In particular, laws and regulations differ among states
regarding the collateralization or transferability of cannabis-related assets, such as cannabis licenses, cannabis inventory, and ownership
interests in licensed cannabis companies. Some state laws and regulations where our borrowers operate may prohibit the collateralization
or transferability of certain cannabis-related assets. Other states may allow the collateralization or transferability of cannabis-related
assets, but with restrictions, such as meeting certain eligibility requirements, utilization of state receiverships, and/or upon approval
by the applicable regulatory authority. Prohibitions or restrictions on our ability to acquire certain cannabis-related assets securing
the loans of our borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

Specifically, there is no limitation under state
law on foreclosing on the real estate underlying the loans that we hold; however, to the extent the real estate is still being used in
cannabis-related activities, we will not foreclose and take title to such real estate as doing so would violate NASDAQ listing standards.
If we determine to foreclose on the real estate underlying a defaulted loan, we would have a third party collateral manager evict the
tenant and have the cannabis equipment and inventory removed from such property. With respect to equipment, receivables and cash accounts,
there are no limitations under state law regarding our ability to foreclose on such collateral. Foreclosing on pledged equity is subject
to approval by the applicable state regulator as it would trigger a change of control, which has to be approved by the state regulator,
in its discretion. Our loans are secured by liens on equity, including the equity in the entity that holds the state-issued license to
cultivate, process, distribute, or retail cannabis, as the case may be, but we will not take title to such equity as doing so would violate
NASDAQ listing standards. We also cannot foreclose on liens on state licenses as they are generally not transferable, nor do we have liens
on cannabis inventory. 

Our ability to force a sale of our real estate
collateral in Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania is governed
by judicial foreclosure. Under judicial foreclosure, we can enforce a judgment in foreclosure by a writ of execution. The writ directs
the sheriff, clerk, special master, referee or other authorized person, as the case may be, to levy on and sell the real property, commonly
at a properly noticed public auction. In Maryland, Massachusetts and West Virginia, a trustee or appointed auctioneer sells the property
at a public sale. 

41 

We cannot take the position of mortgagee-in-possession
as long as the property is used by a cannabis operator, but we can request that the court appoint a receiver to manage and operate the
subject real property until the foreclosure proceedings are completed. The appointment of a receiver to manage the property does not render
us a mortgagee-in-possession. A receiver serves as an officer of the court, appointed to preserve the value of the real property and the
income from the real property during the pendency of foreclosure proceedings or trustee sales. 

Equipment, receivables, and cash in deposit accounts
may be collected under state Uniform Commercial Code UCC ). In all states, we are permitted for non-real estate
collateral (e.g., equipment) to pursue a judicial action and execute on a judgment via sheriffs sale. 

While we cannot foreclose under UCC and take title
or sell equity in a licensed cannabis business, a potential purchaser of a delinquent or defaulted loan could. However, the transfer of
ownership of equity in a licensed cannabis business requires state regulator approval, which can take significant time. 

In addition, if a borrower defaults on a loan from
us and we seek to cause a sale of the collateral, the sales of such assets may be forced upon the borrower at such point when time may
be of the essence. Therefore, the assets may be made available to a limited number of potential purchasers, and particularly in limited-license
states in which we focus, the sales prices may be less than the prices obtained with more time in a larger market. As a result, the sale
of such collateral may not result in sufficient proceeds to repay our loan and could have a material and adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value
of properties that we may acquire upon foreclosure of the properties securing our loans. 

To the extent we foreclose on properties securing
our loans, we may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from such foreclosed properties. In particular, cannabis cultivation
and manufacturing facilities may present environmental concerns of which we are not currently aware. Under various federal, state and
local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released
on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the
release of such hazardous substances. Accordingly, if environmental contamination exists on properties we acquire or develop after acquisition,
we could become subject to liability for the contamination. 

The presence of hazardous substances may adversely
affect an owner s ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property
securing one of our loans becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn
may adversely affect the value of the relevant loan held by us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

If we foreclose on any properties securing our loans,
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial
remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to any properties
securing our loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders. 

The market value of properties securing our loans acquired by
us upon foreclosure may decrease if they cannot be used for cannabis related operations. 

Properties used for cannabis operations, particularly
cultivation and manufacturing facilities, are generally more valuable than if used for other purposes. If we are unable to sell a property
securing our loans to a licensed cannabis company for similar use and we, therefore, must foreclose on such property, we may recover significantly
less than the expected value of the foreclosed property, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
liquidity and results of operations.

Risks Related to Sources of Financing Our Business 

Our growth depends on external sources of capital, which may
not be available on favorable terms or at all. 

We intend to grow by expanding our portfolio of
loans, which we intend to finance primarily through newly issued equity or debt. We may not be in a position to take advantage of attractive
lending opportunities for growth if we are unable, due to global or regional economic uncertainty, changes in the state or federal regulatory
environment relating to our business, our own operating or financial performance or otherwise, to access capital markets on a timely basis
and on favorable terms or at all. In addition, U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least
90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain and certain non-cash
income, and that it pay U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of
its taxable income. Because we intend to grow our business, this limitation may require us to raise additional equity or incur debt at
a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. 

Our access to capital will depend upon a number
of factors over which we have little or no control, including, but not limited to: 

general economic or market conditions; 

the market s view of the quality of our assets; 

the market s perception of our growth potential; 

the current regulatory environment with respect to our business; and 

our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions. 

If general economic instability or downturn leads
to an inability to borrow at attractive rates or at all, our ability to obtain capital to finance our loans to borrowers could be negatively
impacted. In addition, while we do not consider our Company to be engaged in the cannabis industry, banks and other financial institutions
may be reluctant to enter into lending transactions with us, particularly secured lending, because we invest in companies involved in
the cultivation, manufacturing and sale of cannabis. 

If we are unable to obtain capital on terms and
conditions that we find acceptable, we likely will have to reduce the loans we make. In addition, our ability to refinance all or any
debt we may incur in the future, on acceptable terms or at all, is subject to all of the above factors, and will also be affected by our
future financial position, results of operations and cash flows, which additional factors are also subject to significant uncertainties,
and therefore we may be unable to refinance any debt we may incur in the future, as it matures, on acceptable terms or at all. All of
these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

Global economic, political and market conditions could have a
significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, including a negative impact on our
ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms. 

Downgrades by rating agencies to the U.S. government s
credit rating or concerns about its credit and deficit levels in general could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which
may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated portfolio and our ability to access the debt markets on favorable
terms. In addition, a decreased U.S. government credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may weigh
heavily on our financial performance and the value of our equity. Additionally, concerns regarding a potential increase in inflation would
likely cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise. 

Deterioration in the economic conditions in the
Eurozone and globally, including instability in financial markets, may pose a risk to our business. In recent years, financial markets
have been affected at times by a number of global macroeconomic and political events, including the following: large sovereign debts and
fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe and in emerging markets jurisdictions, levels of non-performing loans on the balance sheets
of European banks, the potential effect of any European country leaving the Eurozone, the potential effect of the United Kingdom leaving
the European Union, and market volatility and loss of investor confidence driven by political events. Market and economic disruptions
have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence
and default on consumer debt and home prices, among other factors. We cannot assure you that market disruptions in Europe, including the
increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions, will not impact the global economy, and we cannot assure
you that assistance packages will be available, or if available, be sufficient to stabilize countries and markets in Europe or elsewhere
affected by a financial crisis. To the extent uncertainty regarding any economic recovery in Europe negatively impacts consumer confidence
and consumer credit factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. 

43 

Various social and political circumstances in the
U.S. and around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, including rising trade tensions between the United States and China,
and other uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in the U.S. and foreign, trade, economic and other policies with other countries,
terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health
epidemics), may also contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide.
Specifically, the rising conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and resulting market volatility, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries have imposed
sanctions or other restrictive actions against Russia. Any of the above factors, including sanctions, export controls, tariffs, trade
wars and other governmental actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline. These market and economic disruptions could also negatively
impact the operating results of our borrowers. 

We may incur significant debt, which may subject us to restrictive
covenants and increased risk of loss and may reduce cash available for distributions to our stockholders, and our governing documents
contain no limit on the amount of debt we may incur. 

Subject to market conditions and availability, we
may incur significant debt through bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), public and private debt issuances
and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements. The percentage of leverage we employ will
vary depending on our available capital, our ability to obtain and access financing arrangements with lenders, debt restrictions contained
in those financing arrangements and the lenders and rating agencies estimate of the stability of our loan portfolio s
cash flow. Our governing documents contain no limit on the amount of debt we may incur, and we may significantly increase the amount of
leverage we utilize at any time without approval of our stockholders. Leverage can enhance our potential returns but can also exacerbate
our losses. Incurring substantial debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including,
but not limited to, the risks that: 

our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt we incur or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in such debt, which is likely to result in (i) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (ii) our inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements, and/or (iii) the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale; 

we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, or at all; 

to the extent we borrow debt that bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense; 

our default under any loan with cross-default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness; 

44 

incurring debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that loan yields will increase with higher financing costs; 

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on the debt we may incur, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, stockholder distributions, including distributions currently contemplated or necessary to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, or other purposes; and 

we are not able to refinance debt that matures prior to the loan it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all. 

There can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy
will be successful. If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability
to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. 

Interest rate fluctuations could increase our financing costs,
which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our loans. 

Our primary interest rate exposures will relate
to the financing cost of our debt. To the extent that our financing costs will be determined by reference to floating rates, the amount
of such costs will depend on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, (i) for collateralized debt, the value and liquidity
of the collateral, and for non-collateralized debt, our credit, (ii) the level and movement of interest rates, and (iii) general market
conditions and liquidity. In a period of rising interest rates, our interest expense on floating-rate debt would increase, while any additional
interest income we earn on our floating-rate loans may not compensate for such increase in interest expense. At the same time, the interest
income we earn on our fixed-rate loans would not change, the duration and weighted average life of our fixed-rate loans would increase
and the market value of our fixed-rate loans would decrease. Similarly, in a period of declining interest rates, our interest income on
floating-rate loans would decrease, while any decrease in the interest we are charged on our floating-rate debt may not compensate for
such decrease in interest income and interest we are charged on our fixed-rate debt would not change. Any such scenario could materially
and adversely affect us. 

Additionally, the Federal Reserve has raised the
Federal Funds Rate multiple times in 2022 and may continue to do so in 2023. These developments, along with the United States government s
credit and deficit concerns, global economic uncertainties and market volatility and the impacts of COVID-19, could cause interest rates
to be volatile, which may negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms . 

Recent macroeconomic trends, including
inflation and rising interest rates, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

During the year ended
December 31, 2022, inflation in the United States has accelerated and is currently expected to continue at an elevated level in the near-term.
Rising inflation could have an adverse impact on any variable rate debt we may incur in the future, and our general and administrative
expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our interest income and other revenue. The Federal Reserve has raised interest
rates multiple times in 2022 to combat inflation and restore price stability and rates may continue to rise in 2023. To the extent our
borrowing costs increase faster than the interest income earned from our floating-rate loans, such increases may adversely affect our
cash flows. 

Any bank credit facilities that we may use in the future to finance
our operations may require us to provide collateral or pay down debt. 

We may utilize bank credit facilities (including
term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our loans if they become available on acceptable terms. We may not have the funds available
to repay our debt at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources,
which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot meet these requirements, lenders could accelerate our indebtedness,
increase the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow funds from it, which could materially and adversely affect
our financial condition and ability to implement our investment strategy. In addition, if a lender files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent,
our loans may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us, at least temporarily, of the benefit of such
loans. Such an event could restrict our access to bank credit facilities and increase our cost of capital. The providers of bank credit
facilities may also require us to maintain a certain amount of cash or set aside assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position
that would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. As a result, we may not be able to obtain leverage as fully as we would choose,
which could reduce the return on our loans. If we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition and prospects
could deteriorate rapidly. 

In addition, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to obtain bank credit facilities on favorable terms, or at all. Banks and other financial institutions may be reluctant to enter
into lending transactions with us. 

45 

Adoption of the Basel III standards and other proposed supplementary
regulatory standards may negatively impact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements. 

In response to various financial crises and the
volatility of financial markets, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted the Basel III standards several years ago to reform,
among other things, bank capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk. United States regulators have elected to implement
substantially all of the Basel III standards and have even implemented rules requiring enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards,
which impose capital requirements more stringent than those of the Basel III standards for the most systematically significant banking
organizations in the United States. Adoption and implementation of the Basel III standards and the supplemental regulatory standards adopted
by United States regulators may negatively impact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements due
to an increase in capital requirements for, and constraints on, the financial institutions from which we may borrow. 

Moreover, in January 2019, the Basel Committee published
its revised capital requirements for market risk, known as Fundamental Review of the Trading Book FRTB ), which are expected
to generally result in higher global capital requirements for banks that could, in turn, reduce liquidity and increase financing and hedging
costs. The impact of FRTB will not be known until after any resulting rules are finalized and implemented by the United States federal
bank regulatory agencies. 

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 

Provisions in our Charter and our amended and restated bylaws
(our Bylaws may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition
would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. 

Our Charter and our Bylaws contain provisions that
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our Charter and Bylaws include,
among others, provisions that: 

authorize our Board, without stockholder approval, to cause us to issue additional shares of our common stock or to raise capital through the creation and issuance of our preferred stock, debt securities convertible into common stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our Board in its sole discretion may determine; 

authorize blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board without stockholder approval, subject to certain specified limitations, and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights senior to our common stock; 

specify that only our Board, the chairman of our Board, our chief executive officer or president or, upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast, our secretary can call special meetings of our stockholders; 

establish advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of individuals for election to our Board; 

provide that a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, may fill any vacancy on our Board, whether resulting from an increase in the number of directors or otherwise; and 

provide our Board the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our Bylaws and to make new Bylaws. 

46 

These provisions, alone or together, could delay
or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. 

Any provision of our Charter or Bylaws that has
the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our common
stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Any person or entity purchasing or
otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our
Charter and Bylaws described above. 

Our Board may approve the issuance of stock, including preferred
stock, with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us. 

Our Charter permits our Board, without any action
by our stockholders, to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series. Our Board may also classify or reclassify any
unissued shares of stock and set or change the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock, which rights may be superior
to those of our common stock. Thus, our Board could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and conditions
which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding
common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common stock. 

Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or
MGCL, could inhibit changes of control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control
transactions that could involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests. 

We are a Maryland corporation and subject to the
MGCL. Under the MGCL, certain business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder 
or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified
in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as: (a) any
person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of a corporation;
or (b) an affiliate or associate of a corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of such corporation. 

A person is not an interested stockholder under
the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested
stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or
after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors. 

After the expiration of the five-year period described
above, any business combination between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder must generally be recommended by the board
of directors of such corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: 

80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of such corporation; and 

two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of such corporation, other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected, or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. 

47 

These supermajority vote requirements do not apply
if the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under the MGCL, for their shares in the form of cash
or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. The MGCL also permits various
exemptions from these provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the
interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. By resolution of our Board, we have opted out of the business combination provisions
of the MGCL and provide that any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions
of the MGCL, provided that the business combination is first approved by our Board (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates
or associates of such persons). 

In addition, under the MGCL, holders of our control
shares (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer,
would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control
share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares have no
voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled
to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. Our Bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition
Act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that this exemption will not be amended or
eliminated at any time in the future. 

Additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL
permits our Board, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our Charter or Bylaws, to implement certain
takeover defenses, such as a classified board, some of which we do not have. 

Our Bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland
as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders and provide that
claims relating to causes of action under the Securities Act may only be brought in federal district courts, which could limit stockholders 
ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, if any, and could discourage
lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, if any. 

Our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction,
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any Internal
Corporate Claim, as such term is defined in the MGCL, (b) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf (other than actions
arising under federal securities laws), (c) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any of our directors, officers
or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (d) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL or our Charter or Bylaws or (e) any other action asserting a claim against us
or any of our directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These choice of forum provisions
will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other claim for
which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection
of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any claim arising under the Securities Act. 

These exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability
of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors,
officers, or employees, if any, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees, if any. Alternatively,
if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may
incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and operating results. For example, under the Securities Act, federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all
suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, the exclusive forum provisions described above do not apply to any actions
brought under the Exchange Act. 

48 

Ownership limitations contained in the Charter may restrict change
of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. 

For us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, not
more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (including certain
entities treated as individuals for this purpose) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. For the purpose of assisting our
qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, among other purposes, our Charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership
by any person of more than a certain percentage, currently 9.8 , in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the
outstanding shares of our common stock or 9.8 in value of our outstanding shares of all classes or series of our stock, which we refer
to as the ownership limits. The constructive ownership rules under the Code and our Charter are complex and may cause shares
of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person. As a result,
the acquisition of less than 9.8 of our outstanding common stock or all classes or series of our stock by a person could cause a person
to own constructively in excess of 9.8 of the outstanding shares of our common stock or in excess of 9.8 of the outstanding shares of
all class and series of our stock, respectively, and thus violate the ownership limits. There can be no assurance that our Board, as permitted
in the Charter, will not decrease the ownership limits in the future. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess
of the ownership limits without the consent of our Board will result either in the shares in excess of the limit being transferred by
operation of the Charter to a charitable trust, and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares will not have any rights in
such shares, or in the transfer being void. The ownership limits may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third
party, even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the
price of our common stock (and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our REIT status). In addition, our Board
has granted conditional exceptions to the ownership limits to affiliates of our Sponsor, which may limit our Board s power to increase
the ownership limits or grant further exemptions in the future. 

Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment
Company Act may impose significant limits on our operations. Your investment return in our common stock may be reduced if we are required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

We intend to continue to conduct our operations
so that we will be exempt from the provisions of the Investment Company Act pursuant to an exemption contained in 3(c)(5)(C) thereunder.
The Investment Company Act provides certain protection to investors and imposes certain restrictions on registered investment companies
(including, for example, limitations on the ability of registered investment companies to incur leverage), none of which will be applicable
to us. 

We rely on the exception set forth in Section 3(c)(5)
of the Investment Company Act, which excludes from the definition of investment company [a]ny person who is not engaged in the
business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and
who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses . . . (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens
on and interests in real estate. The SEC generally requires that, for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5) to be available,
at least 55 of an entity s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as qualifying
interests, and at least another 25 of the entity s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying interests or real estate-type
interests (with no more than 20 of the entity s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). 

We classify our assets for purposes of our 3(c)(5)(C)
exemption based upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff and interpretive guidance provided by the SEC and its staff. These no-action
positions are based on specific factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face. No assurance
can be given that the SEC or its staff will concur with our classification of our assets. In addition, the SEC or its staff may, in the
future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act. If we are required
to reclassify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exemption from the definition of an investment company provided by
Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. 

A change in the value of any of our assets could
negatively affect our ability to maintain our exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act. To maintain compliance with
the applicable exemption under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need
to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain. In addition, we may have to acquire additional assets that we might not otherwise have
acquired or may have to forego opportunities to acquire assets that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our investment
strategy. 

A failure by us to maintain this exemption would
require us to significantly restructure our investment strategy. For example, because affiliated transactions are generally prohibited
under the Investment Company Act, we would not be able to enter into transactions with any of our affiliates if we are required to register
as an investment company, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate the business and pay distributions. If
we were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal
and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement,
and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of such entity and liquidate its business. 

49 

Rapid and steep declines in the values of our real estate-related
investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or exemption from the Investment Company Act. 

If the market value or income potential of real
estate-related investments declines as a result of increased interest rates or other factors, we may need to increase our real estate
loans and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exemption from the Investment
Company Act. If the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish.
This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of any non-qualifying assets that we may own. We may have to make investment
decisions that we otherwise would not make absent REIT and Investment Company Act considerations. 

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action
against our directors and officers are limited. 

Our Charter eliminates the liability of our directors
and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law
and our Charter, our directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability
resulting from: 

actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or 

active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action adjudicated. 

Our Charter obligates us to indemnify each of our
directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those
or certain other capacities, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, from and against any claim or liability to which such person
may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving
in such other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors
and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders
may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions
in our Charter or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best
interests. 

Future joint venture investments could be adversely affected
by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and liquidity and disputes
between us and our joint venture partners. 

We may in the future make investments through joint
ventures. Such joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present when we originate or acquire investments without partners,
including the following: 

we may not have exclusive control over the investment or the joint venture, which may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest; 

joint venture agreements often restrict the transfer of a partner s interest or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire and/or on advantageous terms; 

50 

any future joint venture agreements may contain buy-sell provisions pursuant to which one partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between buying the other partner s interest or selling its interest to that partner; 

we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the investment or joint venture, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as with respect to acquisitions or dispositions; 

a partner may, at any time, have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals; 

a partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives, including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act; 

a partner may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions or may become bankrupt, which may mean that we and any other remaining partners generally would remain liable for the joint venture s liabilities; 

our relationships with our partners are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the applicable joint venture agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to own or operate the interests or investments underlying such relationship or may need to purchase such interests or investments at a premium to the market price to continue ownership; 

disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent our Manager and our officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business and could result in subjecting the investments owned by the joint venture to additional risk; or 

we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of a partner, and the activities of a partner could adversely affect our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT or our exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, even though we do not control the joint venture. 

Any of the above may subject us to liabilities in
excess of those contemplated and adversely affect the value of our future joint venture investments. 

Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager and its Affiliates 

Our future success depends on our Manager and its key personnel
and investment professionals. We may not find a suitable replacement for our Manager if our Management Agreement is terminated or if such
key personnel or investment professionals leave the employment of our Manager or otherwise become unavailable to us. 

We rely on the resources of our Manager to manage
our day-to-day operations, as we do not separately employ any personnel. We rely completely on our Manager to provide us with investment
advisory services and general management services. Each of our executive officers also serve as officers or employees of our Manager.
Our Manager has significant discretion as to the implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. Accordingly,
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts
of the officers, key personnel and investment professionals of our Manager as well as the information and deal flow generated by such
individuals. The officers, key personnel and investment professionals of our Manager source, evaluate, negotiate, close and monitor our
loans; therefore, our success depends on their continued service. The departure of any of the officers, key personnel and investment professionals
of our Manager could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

None of our officers are obligated to dedicate any
specific portion of their time to our business. Each of them may have significant responsibilities for other investment vehicles managed
by affiliates of our Manager. As a result, the time these individuals may be able to devote to the management of our business could be
limited. Further, when there are turbulent conditions in the real estate markets or distress in the credit markets, the attention of our
Manager s personnel and our executive officers and the resources of our Manager may also be required by other investment vehicles
managed by affiliates of our Manager. 

In addition, we offer no assurance that our Manager
will remain our manager or that we will continue to have access to our Manager s officers, key personnel and investment professionals
due to the termination of the Management Agreement, our Manager being acquired, or due to other circumstances. Currently, we are managed
by our Board and our officers and by our Manager, as provided for under our Management Agreement. The initial term of the Management Agreement
will expire on May 1, 2024, and will be automatically renewed for one-year terms thereafter unless otherwise terminated. Furthermore,
our Manager may decline to renew the Management Agreement with 90 days written notice prior to the expiration of the renewal
term. If the Management Agreement is terminated and we are unable to find a suitable replacement for our Manager, we may not be able to
execute its investment strategy. 

51 

Our growth depends on the ability of our Manager to make loans
on favorable terms that satisfy our investment strategy and otherwise generate attractive risk-adjusted returns initially and consistently
from time to time. 

Our ability to achieve our investment objective
depends on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on the management and investment teams of our Manager and their ability to identify
and to make loans on favorable terms in accordance with our investment strategy as well as on our access to financing on acceptable terms.
The demands on the time of the professional staff of our Manager will increase as our portfolio grows and the management of our existing
portfolio may divert our Manager s attention from future potential loans or otherwise slow our rate of investment. Our Manager may
be unable to successfully and efficiently integrate new loans into our existing portfolio or otherwise effectively manage our assets or
our future growth effectively. We cannot assure you that our Manager will be able to hire, train, supervise, manage and retain new officers
and employees to manage future growth effectively, and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business. The failure
to consummate loans on advantageous terms without substantial expense or delay would impede our growth, would negatively affect our results
of operations and our ability to generate cash flow and make distributions to our stockholders, and could cause the value of our common
stock to decline. 

There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with
our Manager that could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders. 

We are subject to conflicts of interest arising
out of our relationship with our Manager and its affiliates. We are managed by our Manager, and our executive officers are employees of
our Manager. There is no guarantee that the policies and procedures adopted by us, the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement
or the policies and procedures adopted by our Manager and its affiliates, will enable us to identify, adequately address or mitigate these
conflicts of interest. 

Some examples of conflicts of interest that may
arise by virtue of our relationship with our Manager include: 

Manager s advisory activities. While
our Manager and its affiliates have agreed that for so long as our Manager is managing us, neither it nor any of its affiliates will sponsor
or manage any other mortgage REIT that invests primarily in loans of the same kind as our Company, our Manager and its affiliates may
otherwise manage other investment vehicles that have investment objectives that compete or overlap with, and may from time to time invest
in, our target asset classes. This may apply to existing investment vehicles or investment vehicles that may be organized in the future.
Consequently, we, on the one hand, and these other investment vehicles, on the other hand, may from time to time pursue the same or similar
loan opportunities. To the extent such other investment vehicles seek to acquire the same target assets as us, the scope of opportunities
otherwise available to us may be adversely affected and/or reduced. Our Manager or its affiliates may also give advice to such other investment
vehicles that may differ from the advice given to us even though their investment objectives may be the same or similar to ours. 

Allocation of loans. Our
Manager and its affiliates endeavor to allocate loan opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, subject to their internal policies.
The internal policies of our Manager and its affiliates, which may be amended without our consent, are intended to enable us to share
equitably with any other investment vehicles that are managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager. In general, loan opportunities
are allocated taking into consideration various factors, including, among others, the relevant investment vehicles available capital,
their investment objectives or strategies, their risk profiles and their existing or prior positions in a borrower or particular loan,
their potential conflicts of interest, the nature of the opportunity and market conditions, as well as the rotation of loan opportunities.
Nevertheless, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain loans made by investment vehicles managed
by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager. In addition, there may be conflicts in the allocation of loan opportunities among us and
the investment vehicles that our Manager or affiliates of our Manager manage in the future. 

52 

Co-investments. Other
investment vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager may co-invest with us or hold positions in a loan where we have
also invested, including by means of splitting commitments, participating in loans or other means of syndicating loans. Such loans may
raise potential conflicts of interest between us and such other investment vehicles. To the extent such investment vehicles seek to acquire
the same target assets as us, subject to the internal policies of our Manager and its affiliates described above, the scope of opportunities
otherwise available to us may be adversely affected and/or reduced. In such circumstances, the size of the investment opportunity in loans
otherwise available to us may be less than it would otherwise have been, and we may participate in such opportunities on different and
potentially less favorable economic terms than such other parties if our Manager deems such participation as being otherwise in our best
interests. Furthermore, when such other investment vehicles have interests or requirements that do not align with our interests, including
differing liquidity needs or desired investment horizons, conflicts may arise in the manner in which any voting or control rights are
exercised with respect to the relevant borrower, potentially resulting in an adverse impact on us. If we participate in a co-investment
with an investment vehicle managed by our Manager or an affiliate of our Manager and such vehicle fails to fund a future advance on a
loan, we may be required to, or we may elect to, cover such advance and invest additional funds. In addition, if we and such other investment
vehicles invest in different classes or types of debt, equity or other investments relating to the same borrower, actions may be taken
by such other investment vehicles that are adverse to our interests, including, but not limited to, during a work-out, restructuring or
insolvency proceeding or similar matter occurring with respect to such loan. 

Loans in which other investment vehicles managed
by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager hold different loans. We may invest in, acquire, sell assets to
or provide financing to investment vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager and their borrowers or purchase assets
from, sell assets to, or arrange financing from any such investment vehicles and their borrowers. Any such transactions will require approval
by a majority of our independent directors. There can be no assurance that any procedural protections will be sufficient to ensure that
these transactions will be made on terms that will be at least as favorable to us as those that would have been obtained in an arm s-length
transaction. 

Fees and expenses. We
will be responsible for certain fees and expenses as determined by our Manager, including due diligence costs, legal, accounting and financial
advisor fees and related costs, incurred in connection with evaluating and consummating loan opportunities, regardless of whether such
loans are ultimately consummated by the parties thereto. 

The ability of our Manager and its officers and employees to
engage in other business activities may reduce the time our Manager spends managing our business and may result in certain conflicts of
interest. 

Certain of our officers and directors and the officers
and other personnel of our Manager also serve or may serve as officers, directors or partners of certain affiliates of our Manager, as
well as investment vehicles sponsored by such affiliates, including investment vehicles or managed accounts not yet established, whether
managed or sponsored by affiliates or our Manager. Accordingly, the ability of our Manager and its officers and employees to engage in
other business activities may reduce the time our Manager spends managing our business. These activities could be viewed as creating a
conflict of interest insofar as the time and effort of the professional staff of our Manager and its officers and employees will not be
devoted exclusively to our business; instead, it will be allocated between our business and the management of these other investment vehicles. 

In the course of our investing activities, we pay
Base Management Fees to our Manager and will reimburse our Manager for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common
stock will invest on a gross basis and receive any distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting
in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct loans. As a result of this arrangement, our Manager s
interests may be less aligned with our interests. 

53 

Our Management Agreement with our Manager was not negotiated
on an arm s-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party, and
the manner of determining the Base Management Fees may not provide sufficient incentive to our Manager to maximize risk-adjusted returns
for our portfolio since it is based on the book value of our equity per annum and not on our performance. 

We rely completely on our Manager to provide us
with investment advisory and general management services. Our executive officers also serve as officers or employees of our Manager. Our
Management Agreement was negotiated between related parties and their terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as
if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. 

We pay our Manager Base Management Fees regardless
of the performance of our portfolio. Pursuant to the terms of our Management Agreement, our Manager receives Base Management Fees that
are calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, in an amount equal to 0.375 (1.50 on an annualized basis) of our Equity, subject
to certain adjustments, including any agency fees relating to our loans, but excluding the Incentive Compensation and any diligence fees
paid to and earned by our Manager and paid by third parties in connection with our Manager s due diligence of potential loans. Such
Base Management Fees will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Our Manager s
entitlement to the Base Management Fees, which are not based upon performance metrics or goals, might reduce its incentive to devote its
time and effort to seeking loans that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. Further, the Base Management Fee structure
gives our Manager the incentive to maximize the book value of our equity raised by the issuance of new equity securities or the retention
of existing equity value, regardless of the effect of these actions on existing stockholders. In other words, the Base Management Fee
structure will reward our Manager primarily based on the size of our equity raised and not necessarily on our financial returns to stockholders.
This in turn could hurt both our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. 

The Incentive Compensation payable to our Manager under the Management
Agreement may cause our Manager to select riskier loans to increase its Incentive Compensation. 

In addition to the Base Management Fees, our Manager
is entitled to receive Incentive Compensation under our Management Agreement. Under our Management Agreement, we pay Incentive Compensation
to our Manager based upon our achievement of targeted levels of Core Earnings. Core Earnings is generally defined in our
Management Agreement as, for a given period, the net income (loss) computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals GAAP ), excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the Incentive Compensation, (iii) depreciation and amortization,
(iv) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items
are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss); provided that Core Earnings does not exclude, in the case
of loans with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income
that we have not yet received in cash, and (v) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions
between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of such independent directors. 

In evaluating loans and other management strategies,
the opportunity to earn Incentive Compensation based on Core Earnings and realized profits, as applicable, may lead our Manager to place
undue emphasis on the maximization of Core Earnings and realized profits at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital,
in order to achieve higher Incentive Compensation. Loans with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could
result in increased risk to the value of our loan portfolio. 

Terminating our Management Agreement for unsatisfactory performance
of our Manager or electing not to renew the Management Agreement may be difficult, and terminating our Management Agreement in certain
circumstances requires payment of a substantial termination fee. 

Terminating our Management Agreement without cause
is difficult and costly. Our independent directors and the Audit Committee of our Board will review our Manager s performance and
the applicable Base Management Fees and Incentive Compensation at least annually. Upon 90 days written notice prior to the expiration
of any renewal term, our Management Agreement may be terminated upon the affirmative vote of at least a majority of our independent directors,
based upon unsatisfactory performance by our Manager that is materially detrimental to us. The Management Agreement provides that upon
any termination as described in the foregoing, we would pay our Manager a Termination Fee equal to three times the sum of the annualized
average quarterly Base Management Fees and annualized average quarterly Incentive Compensation received from us during the 24-month period
immediately preceding the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to such termination. This provision increases the cost to us of
terminating the Management Agreement and adversely affects our ability to terminate our Manager without cause. 

54 

Even if we terminate our Management Agreement for cause, we may
be required to continue to retain our Manager for 30 days following the occurrence of events giving rise to a for-cause termination. 

While we have the right to terminate our Management
Agreement for cause without paying a Termination Fee, we must provide 30 days notice to our Manager in advance of any such termination,
including in the event of our Manager s fraud, misappropriation of funds, embezzlement or bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence
or reckless disregard in the performance of its duties. As a result, we would be forced to continue to pay our Manager during such 30-day
period and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement for our Manager during this period or, if we were able to find a suitable
replacement, we may be required to compensate the new manager while continuing to pay our terminated Manager during this 30-day period,
unless our Manager waives the notice requirement. This could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, which could adversely
affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

Our Manager manages our portfolio in accordance with very broad
investment guidelines and our Board does not approve each loan and financing decision made by our Manager, which may result in us making
riskier loans than those currently comprising our existing portfolio. 

While our Board periodically reviews our loan portfolio,
it does not review all proposed loans. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, such directors may rely primarily on information provided
to them by our Manager. Our Investment Guidelines (as defined below) may be changed from time to time upon recommendation by our Manager
and approval by a majority of our Board (which must include a majority of the independent directors of our Board) and our Manager, without
stockholders consent. Furthermore, our Manager may use complex strategies and loans entered into by our Manager that may be difficult
or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our Board. Our Manager has great latitude in determining the types of loans that
are proper for us, which could result in loan returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would
materially and adversely affect our business operations and results. In addition, our Manager is not subject to any limits or proportions
with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that we may in the future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our
exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and our qualification as a REIT. Decisions made and loans entered into by
our Manager may not fully reflect your best interests. 

Our Manager may change its investment process, or elect not to
follow it, without the consent of our stockholders and at any time, which may adversely affect the performance of our portfolio. 

Our Manager may change its investment process without
the consent of our stockholders and at any time. In addition, there can be no assurance that our Manager will follow its investment process
in relation to the identification and underwriting of prospective loans. Changes in our Manager s investment process may result
in inferior, among other things, due diligence and underwriting standards, which may adversely affect the performance of our portfolio. 

While we believe that we benefit from the expertise and experience
of our Manager s key personnel and investment professionals, we have a limited operating history and our Manager has not previously
managed a REIT. 

We believe that we will benefit from the extensive
and diverse expertise and significant financing industry experience of the key personnel and investment professionals of our Manager and
its affiliates. However, investors should understand that we and our Manager are recently formed entities that have limited prior operating
history upon which to evaluate our and our Manager s likely performance and we and our Manager have not previously managed a REIT. 

55 

In addition to other analytical tools, our Manager may utilize
financial models to evaluate loan opportunities, the accuracy and effectiveness of which cannot be guaranteed. 

In addition to other analytical tools, our Manager
may utilize financial models to evaluate loan opportunities, the accuracy and effectiveness of which cannot be guaranteed. In all cases,
financial models are only estimates of future results which are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed.
There can be no assurance that our Manager s projected results will be attained and actual results may vary significantly from the
projections. General economic and industry-specific conditions, which are not predictable, can have an adverse impact on the reliability
of projections. 

Our Manager s and its affiliates liability is limited
under the Management Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify our Manager against certain liabilities. As a result, we could experience
poor performance or losses for which our Manager and its affiliates would not be liable. 

Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager
does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and will not be responsible for
any action of our Board in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Under the terms of the Management Agreement,
our Manager, its affiliates, and any of their respective members, stockholders, managers, partners, trustees, personnel, officers, directors,
employees, consultants and any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager (collectively, the Manager Parties will not be liable to us for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement, except by reason
of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the relevant Management
Agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify the Manager Parties with respect to all losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges
and claims of any nature whatsoever, and any and all expenses, costs and fees related thereto, arising from acts or omissions of the Manager
Parties not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in
accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with the members of the
Manager s Investment Committee to indemnify and advance certain fees, costs and expenses to such individuals, subject to certain
standards to be met and certain other limitations and conditions as set forth in such indemnification agreements. These protections may
lead our Manager to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 

Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT 

Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a
regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders. 

We intend to operate in a manner so as to continue
to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that our organization and method of operation will enable us to
continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we will qualify as such.
This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, and regulations
promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department thereunder Treasury Regulations as to which there are only limited judicial
and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition,
while we intend to take the position that we and certain of our affiliates are treated as separate entities for purposes of determining
whether we qualify as a REIT, there can be no guarantee that the IRS will agree with our position. If we and certain of our affiliates
are treated as the same entity for this purpose, we may not qualify as a REIT. Furthermore, future legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the U.S. tax laws or the application of the U.S. tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. 

56 

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,
we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distributions to our stockholders because: 

we would not be allowed a deduction
for distributions paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate
rates; 

we could be subject to increased
state and local taxes; and 

unless we are entitled to relief
under statutory provisions, we would not be able to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which
we were disqualified. 

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we
will no longer be required to make distributions to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of all
these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it would adversely
affect the value of our common stock. 

Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities
that reduce our cash flows. 

Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may
be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income
from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. In addition, in order
to meet the REIT qualification requirements or to avert the imposition of a 100 tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from
dealer property or inventory, we may hold certain assets through one or more to-be-formed taxable REIT subsidiaries that will be subject
to corporate-level income tax at regular rates. In addition, if we lend money to a taxable REIT subsidiary (including loans to partnerships
or limited liability companies in which a taxable REIT subsidiary owns an interest), the taxable REIT subsidiary may be unable to deduct
all or a portion of the interest paid to us, which could result in an increased corporate-level tax liability. Any of these taxes would
decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability
to exercise our business plan and liquidity and may force us to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. 

In order to maintain our REIT status and to meet
the REIT distribution requirements, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis or sell assets, even if the then-prevailing market
conditions are not favorable for these borrowings or sales. In addition, we may need to reserve cash to satisfy our REIT distribution
requirements, even though there are attractive lending opportunities that may be available. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to
our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding capital
gains and certain non-cash income. In addition, we will be subject to corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 
of our taxable income, including any net capital gain. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements
of the Code for REITs and to minimize or eliminate our corporate income tax obligation to the extent consistent with our business objectives.
Our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual
receipt of income and the recognition of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures,
the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. In addition, if the IRS were to disallow certain of our deductions,
such as management fees, depreciation or interest expense, by alleging that we, through our business operations and/or loan agreements
with state-licensed cannabis borrowers, are subject to Section 280E of the Code or otherwise, we could be unable to meet the distribution
requirements and would fail to qualify as a REIT. Likewise, any governmental fine on us would not be deductible, and the inability to
deduct such fines could cause us to be unable to satisfy the distribution requirement. 

The insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our
distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in
order to fund distributions required to maintain our REIT status. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on
the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of
our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. To address and/or mitigate some of these issues, we
may make taxable distributions that are in part paid in cash and in part paid in our equity. In such cases, our stockholders may have
tax liabilities from such distributions in excess of the cash they receive. The treatment of such taxable stock distributions is not entirely
clear, and it is possible the taxable stock distribution will not count towards our distribution requirement, in which case adverse consequences
could apply. 

57 

Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise
attractive opportunities or to liquidate otherwise attractive loans. 

To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification
of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego loans that
we might otherwise make or liquidate loans we might otherwise continue to hold. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder
our performance by limiting our ability to make and/or maintain ownership of certain otherwise attractive loans. 

Temporary investment in short-term securities
and income from such investment generally will allow us to satisfy various REIT income and asset qualifications, but only during the one-year
period beginning on the date we receive such net proceeds from our initial public offering. If we are unable to invest a sufficient amount
of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in qualifying real estate assets within such one-year period, we could fail to satisfy
the gross income tests and/or we could be limited to investing all or a portion of any remaining funds in cash. If we fail to satisfy
such income test, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, we could fail to qualify as a REIT. 

The tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to
engage in certain loans involving the sale or other disposition of property or that would otherwise subject us to a 100 penalty tax. 

A REIT s net income from prohibited transactions
is subject to a 100 tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property,
held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold a significant
amount of assets as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, the characterization of an asset
sale as a prohibited transaction depends on the particular facts and circumstances. The Code provides a safe harbor that, if met, allows
a REIT to avoid being treated as engaged in a prohibited transaction. We may sell certain assets in transactions that do not meet all
of the requirements of such safe harbor if we believe the transaction would nevertheless not be a prohibited transaction based on an analysis
of all of the relevant facts and circumstances. If the IRS were to successfully argue that such a sale was in fact a prohibited transaction,
we would be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any net income from such sale. In addition, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions
tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales, even though the sales might otherwise be beneficial to us. 

Legislative, regulatory or administrative tax changes related
to REITs could materially and adversely affect our business. 

At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws or
Treasury Regulations governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations, may be changed, possibly with
retroactive effect. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or
any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or
become effective or whether any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be
adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. 

Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced
tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. 

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for certain
qualified dividends payable to individual U.S. stockholders is 20 . Dividends payable by REITs, however, are generally not qualified dividends
and therefore are not eligible for taxation at the reduced rates. However, to the extent such dividends are attributable to certain dividends
that we receive from a taxable REIT subsidiary or to income from a prior year that was retained by us and subject to corporate tax, such
dividends generally will be eligible for the reduced rates that apply to qualified dividend income. The more favorable rates applicable
to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive
than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs,
including our equity. However, through the 2025 tax year, individual U.S. stockholders may be entitled to claim a deduction in determining
their taxable income of 20 of ordinary REIT dividends (dividends other than capital gain dividends and dividends attributable to qualified
dividend income received by us, if any). If we fail to qualify as a REIT, such stockholders may not claim this deduction with respect
to dividends paid by us. Stockholders are urged to consult tax advisers regarding the effect of this change on the effective tax rate
with respect to REIT dividends. 

58 

The ability of our Board to revoke our REIT election without
stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders. 

The Charter provides that our Board may revoke or
otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if our Board determines that it is no longer in our best
interest to attempt to, or continue to, qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income
tax on our net taxable income and we generally would no longer be required to distribute any of our net taxable income to our stockholders,
which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders. 

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge
our operational risks effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. 

The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability
to hedge risks relating to its operations. Any income from a hedging transaction that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes,
price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, if properly identified under applicable Treasury
Regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests. To the extent that we enter
into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes
of both of the gross income tests. 

To the extent the business interest deductions of our subsidiaries,
if any, are deferred or disallowed, our taxable income may exceed our cash available for distributions to stockholders. 

Code Section 163(j) limits the deductibility of
 business interest for both individuals and corporations. Certain real property trades or businesses are permitted to elect
out of this limitation, but we do not expect this election to be available to us. To the extent our interest deductions or those of our
subsidiaries, if any, are deferred or disallowed under Code Section 163(j) or any other provision of law, our taxable income may exceed
our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. As a result, there is a risk that we may have taxable income in excess of cash
available for distribution. In that event, we may need to borrow funds or take other action to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements
for the taxable year in which this phantom income is recognized. 

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

As significant beneficial owners of our Manager, our founders
can exert significant influence over our corporate actions and important corporate matters. 

Our founders, Mr. Mazarakis, our Executive
Chairman, Mr. Cappell, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Bodmeier, our Co-President, beneficially own approximately 4.1 of our
outstanding equity. Our founders also own 100 of the outstanding equity of our Manager. 

In addition, one or more private funds affiliated
with our Manager purchased 17.5 million in shares in the initial public offering at the initial public offering price. Our founders
own the general partner of each of the private funds that invested in the initial public offering and are responsible for making investment
decisions on behalf of each such fund. 

Our founders could therefore exert substantial influence
over our corporate matters, such as electing directors and approving material mergers, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or other business
combination transactions, as applicable. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control which could
have the dual effect of depriving our stockholders from an opportunity to receive a premium for their equity as part of a sale of our
Company and otherwise reducing the price of such equity. 

59 

The market price for our common stock may be volatile, which
could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. 

The market
price and liquidity of the market for our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our
control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. Some of the factors that could negatively affect or
result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include: 

our actual or projected operating
results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity or changes in business strategy or prospects; 

changes in governmental policies,
regulations or laws; 

loss of a major funding source or inability to obtain new favorable funding sources in the future; 

equity issuances by us, or
share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur; 

actual, anticipated or perceived
accounting or internal control problems; 

publication of research reports
about us, the real estate industry or the cannabis industry; 

our value of the properties
securing our loans; 

changes in market valuations
of similar companies; 

adverse market reaction to
any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future; 

additions to or departures
of the executive officers or key personnel supporting or assisting us from our Manager or its affiliates, including our Manager s
investment professionals; 

speculation in the press or
investment community about us or other similar companies; 

our failure to meet, or the
lowering of, our earnings estimates or those of any securities analysts; 

increases in market interest
rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for our common stock (if we have begun to make distributions to
our stockholders) and which could cause the cost of our interest expenses on our debt to increase; 

failure to qualify or maintain
our qualification as a REIT or exclusion from the Investment Company Act; 

price and volume fluctuations
in the stock market generally; and 

general market and economic
conditions, including the state of the credit and capital markets. 

Any of the factors listed above could materially
adversely affect your investment in our common stock, and our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the initial public
offering price, which could contribute to a loss of all or part of your investment. In such circumstances the trading price of our common
stock may not recover and may experience a further decline. 

60 

In addition, broad market and industry factors could
materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general,
and Nasdaq and the market for cannabis-related companies and REITs have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often
been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations
of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for finance companies or for those companies
in the cannabis industry or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the finance
or cannabis market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, financial condition, results
of operations or growth prospects. 

The value of our equity securities could be materially and adversely
affected by our level of cash distributions. 

The value of the equity securities of a company
whose principal business is similar to ours is based primarily upon investors perception of its growth potential and its current
and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the market value
of its underlying assets. For that reason, our equity may be valued at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share.
To the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds,
while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the price at which our equity could trade. Our failure
to meet investors expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would materially and adversely affect
the valuation of our equity. 

Future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior
to our common stock upon a bankruptcy liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for
the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the value of our stock. 

In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital
resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. As the cannabis industry continues to evolve
and to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, we expect the demand for capital to continue to increase as operators seek
to enter and build out new markets. We expect the principal amount of the loans we originate to increase and that we will need to raise
additional equity and/or debt funds to increase our liquidity in the near future. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt
securities, lenders with respect to any of our borrowings and holders of our preferred stock, if any, will receive a distribution of our
available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings by us may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders
or reduce the valuation of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions
and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings,
and holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the valuation of our common stock and diluting their ownership
interest. 

We may in the future pay distributions from sources other than
our cash flow from operations, including borrowings, offering proceeds or the sale of assets, which means we will have less funds available
for investments or less income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. 

We may in the future pay distributions from sources
other than from our cash flow from operations. We intend to fund the payment of regular distributions to our stockholders entirely from
cash flow from our operations. However, we may from time to time not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions
to stockholders. Therefore, if we choose to pay a distribution, we may choose to use cash flows from financing activities, including borrowings
(including borrowings secured by our assets) and net proceeds of this or a prior offering, from the sale of assets or from other sources
to fund distributions to our stockholders. 

To the extent that we fund distributions from sources
other than cash flows from operations, including borrowings, offering proceeds or proceeds from asset sales, the value of your investment
will decline, and such distributions may constitute a return of capital and we may have fewer funds available for the funding of loans
or less income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. Further, to the extent distributions exceed our earnings and profits,
a stockholder s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder s basis, the stockholder
will be required to recognize capital gain. 

61 

There is a risk that you may not receive distributions as holders
of our common stock or that such dividends may not grow over time. 

We intend to make regular quarterly distributions
to our stockholders, consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, any future determination
to actually pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions,
including under agreements for indebtedness, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors,
our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our Board deems relevant. We therefore
cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results and other circumstances that will allow us to make a specified level of cash
distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. 

We are an emerging growth company and a smaller
reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller
reporting companies will make shares of our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We are an emerging growth company 
as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and exemptions from
the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments
not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year
during which our total annual revenue equals or exceeds 1.235 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of
the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three
year period, more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date issued on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer under the Exchange Act. 

Similarly,
as a smaller reporting company under federal securities laws, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to, reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We may be a smaller reporting company
even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. 

We cannot predict if investors
will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage
of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company, as applicable. 

General Risk Factors 

We rely on information technology in our operations, and security
breaches and other disruptions in our systems could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business
and reputation to suffer. 

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect
and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our borrowers and business
partners, including personally identifiable information of our borrowers and employees, if any, on our networks. Despite our security
measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance
or other disruptions. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access
to our information systems or those of our borrowers for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting
data or causing operational disruption. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed,
publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial
data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation, damage to business
relationships and regulatory fines and penalties. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully
insured or indemnified by other means. Although we intend to implement processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity
risks and cyber intrusions, such measures will not guarantee that a cyber-incident will not occur and/or that our financial results, operations
or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. In addition, cybersecurity has become a top priority
for regulators around the world, and some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches
involving certain types of personal data. If we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses,
a disruption of our business, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. 

62 

We could be subject to litigation filed by or against us, including
class action litigation. 

In the past, securities class action litigation
has often been brought against a company following a period of volatility or decline in the market price of its securities. 

Legal or governmental proceedings brought by or
on behalf of third parties may adversely affect our financial results. Our investment activities may include activities that are hostile
in nature and will subject it to the risks of becoming involved in such proceedings. The expense of defending claims against us and paying
any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would be borne by us and would reduce net assets. Our Manager will be indemnified by
us in connection with such proceedings, subject to certain conditions. Similarly, we may from time to time institute legal proceedings
on behalf of ourselves or others, the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business. 

If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about
our business or if they publish negative reports or downgrade our stock, the price of our common stock could decline. 

The trading market for our common stock will rely
in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors.
We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may materially adversely
affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those
analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts
cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and interest in our stock could
decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and may also impair our ability to expand our business
with existing customers and attract new customers. 

Future sales of our capital stock or other securities convertible
into our capital stock could cause the value of our common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares of our common
stock. 

Our Board is authorized, without stockholder approval,
to cause us to issue additional shares of our common stock and to raise capital through the creation and issuance of preferred stock,
debt securities convertible into common stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our Board in its
sole discretion may determine. 

Sales of substantial amounts of our capital stock
or other securities convertible into our capital stock could cause the valuation of our capital stock to decrease significantly. We cannot
predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our equity, or the availability of our equity for future sales, on the value of our equity.
Sales of substantial amounts of our equity by any large stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect
the valuation of our equity. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control
over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could
lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would materially adversely affect our business and the trading price
of our common stock. 

Effective internal controls over financial reporting
are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or
improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. When we lose our status as an emerging growth company our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to
attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management
to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.
Any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered
public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses
or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention
or improvement. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which
could materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 

63 

Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over
financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and
the value of our common stock. 

We are obligated to maintain proper and effective
internal control over financial reporting, including the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 ). We will not be required to comply with all of the requirements of Section 404 until
we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Prior to the IPO, we were not subject to the public company internal control
framework requirements and therefore did not sufficiently design and document our control environment to be in compliance with all required
public company standards contemplated by Section 404 that we will eventually be required to meet. Beginning with this annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we are required to conduct annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest
to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company under
the JOBS Act. 

If we are not able to implement the requirements
of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our operations, financial reporting or financial results could be adversely
affected. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and
thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing
rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our financing arrangements. There could also be a
negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of our consolidated
financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements could also suffer. This could materially
adversely affect us. 

Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect
all errors or acts of fraud. 

We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal
controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. 

These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. For example, our directors
or executive officers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or arrangement causing us to fail to make any related party
transaction disclosures. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

If our assets are deemed to be plan assets, we may be exposed
to liabilities under Title I of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, and the Code. 

In some circumstances where an ERISA plan holds
an interest in an entity, the assets of the entity are deemed to be ERISA plan assets unless an exception applies. This is known as the
 look-through rule. Under those circumstances, the obligations and other responsibilities of plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries
and plan administrators, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons, under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may
be applicable, and there may be liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. We believe that our assets should not
be treated as plan assets because the shares of our common stock should qualify as publicly-offered securities that are
exempt from the look-through rules under applicable Treasury Regulations. We note, however, that because certain limitations are imposed
upon the transferability of shares of our common stock so that we may qualify as a REIT, and perhaps for other reasons, it is possible
that this exemption may not apply. If that is the case, and if we are exposed to liability under ERISA or the Code, our performance and
results of operations could be adversely affected. 

64 

Economic recessions or downturns could impair our borrowers and
harm our operating results. 

Because the operations of our borrowers are heavily
dependent on retail sales, many of our borrowers may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions and, during such periods, may
be unable to satisfy their debt service obligations to us. Therefore, during these periods, our non-performing assets may increase and
the value of our portfolio may decrease if we are required to write-down the values of our loans. Adverse economic conditions may also
decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio
and a decrease in our revenues, net income and asset values. 

A borrower s failure to satisfy financial
or operating covenants imposed by us or other creditors could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when its debt
obligations are due and foreclosure on its assets representing collateral for its obligations, which could trigger cross-defaults under
other agreements and jeopardize our borrower s ability to meet its obligations under the loans that we hold. We may incur expenses
to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting borrower. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

Not applicable. 

Item 2. Properties 

We do not own any real estate or other physical
properties materially important to our operation. Our principal executive offices are currently located at 1680 Michigan Avenue, Suite
700, Miami Beach, FL 33139. All locations are provided to us by the Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. We believe that our
office facilities are and will be suitable and adequate for our business. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently subject to any material legal
proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may become involved
in litigation or other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Furthermore, third-parties may
try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our loans. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq
Global Market under the symbol REFI. On February 28, 2023, the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq
Global Market, was 14.66 per share. There were 74 holders of record of our common stock as of February 28, 2023. This number does not
include beneficial owners who hold shares of our common stock in street name. 

There were no unregistered sales of equity securities
during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Distribution Information 

We intend to make regular quarterly distributions
to our stockholders, consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. federal income tax
law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends
paid and excluding net capital gains and certain non-cash income, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that
it annually distributes less than 100 of its REIT taxable income. As a result, in order to satisfy the requirements for us to qualify
as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income and excise tax, we intend to make regular quarterly distributions of all
or substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders out of assets legally available therefor. REIT taxable income as computed
for purposes of the foregoing tax rules will not necessarily correspond to our net income as determined for financial reporting purposes,
or our Distributable Earnings as described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations Key Financial Measures and Indicators Distributable Earnings . See U.S. Federal Income
Tax Considerations Taxation Requirements for Qualification Annual Distribution Requirements for a summary
of our distribution requirements as a REIT. 

Any future determination to actually pay dividends
or other distributions will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions,
including under agreements for indebtedness we may incur, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among
other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under
the REIT provisions of the Code, our REIT taxable income and other factors that our Board deems relevant. Under the MGCL, we generally
may only pay a dividend or other distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would be able to pay our indebtedness as
it becomes due in the usual course of business and our total assets exceed our total liabilities. 

To the extent that our cash available for distribution
is less than the amount required to be distributed under the REIT provisions of the Code, we may be required to fund distributions from
working capital or through equity, equity-related or debt financings or, in certain circumstances, asset sales, as to which our ability
to consummate loans in a timely manner on favorable terms, or at all, cannot be assured, or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution
in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 

Item 6. [Reserved] 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that
are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current
expectations and views of future events, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could
differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed above in Risk Factors and those identified below and elsewhere in this
annual report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.

Overview 

We are a commercial real estate finance company.
Our primary investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over time primarily through consistent
current income dividends and other distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by
originating, structuring and investing in first mortgage loans and alternative structured financings secured by commercial real estate
properties. Our current portfolio is comprised primarily of senior loans to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry, secured
by real estate, equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations
governing such borrowers. We intend to grow the size of our portfolio by continuing the track record of our business and the business
conducted by our Manager and its affiliates by making loans to leading operators and property owners in the cannabis industry. There is
no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective. 

Our Manager and its affiliates seek to originate
real estate loans between 5 million and 200 million, generally with one- to five-year terms and amortization when terms exceed three
years. We generally act as co-lenders in such transactions and intend to hold up to 50 million of the aggregate loan amount, with the
remainder to be held by affiliates or third party co-investors. We may revise such concentration limits from time to time as our loan
portfolio grows. Other investment vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager may co-invest with us or hold positions
in a loan where we have also invested, including by means of splitting commitments, participating in loans or other means of syndicating
loans. We will not engage in a co-investment transaction with an affiliate where the affiliate has a senior position to the loan held
by us. To the extent that an affiliate provides financing to one of our borrowers, such loans will be working capital loans or loans that
are subordinate to our loans. We may also serve as co-lenders in loans originated by third parties and, in the future, we may also acquire
loans or loan participations. Loans that have a one to two year maturity are generally interest only loans. 

Our loans are secured by real estate and, in addition,
when lending to owner-operators in the cannabis industry, other collateral, such as equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of
the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we seek to impose strict loan covenants and seek
personal or corporate guarantees for additional protection. As of December 31, 2022, 13.6 of the loans held in our portfolio are backed
by personal or corporate guarantees. We aim to maintain a portfolio diversified across jurisdictions and across verticals, including cultivators,
processors, dispensaries, as well as ancillary businesses. In addition, we may invest in borrowers that have equity securities that are
publicly traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange CSE in Canada and/or over-the-counter in the United States. 

As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio is comprised
primarily of first mortgages to established multi-state or single-state cannabis operators or property owners. We consider cannabis operators
to be established if they are state-licensed and are deemed to be operational by the applicable state regulator. We do not own any stock,
warrants to purchase stock or other forms of equity in any of our portfolio companies that are involved in the cannabis industry, and
we will not take stock, warrants or equity in such issuers until permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. federal
laws and regulations. 

We are an externally managed Maryland corporation
that elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 of the Code, commencing with our taxable period ended December 31, 2021. We
believe that our method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs
or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us continuing to satisfy numerous asset, income and distribution
tests, which in turn depend, in part, on our operating results. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us
and our subsidiaries to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act. 

Revenues 

We operate as one operating segment and are primarily
focused on financing senior secured loans and other types of loans for established state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry.
These loans are generally held for investment and are secured by real estate, equipment, licenses and other assets of the borrowers to
the extent permitted by the applicable laws and the regulations governing such borrowers. 

67 

We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest
income on loans. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 83.1 and 53.2 , respectively, of our portfolio was comprised of floating
rate loans, and 16.9 and 46.8 of our portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans, respectively. The
floating rate loans described above are variable based upon the Prime Rate plus an applicable margin, and in many cases, a Prime Rate
floor. 

The Prime
Rate during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:

(1) Rate obtained from the Wall Street Journal 

Interest on our loans is generally payable monthly.
The principal amount of our loans and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon generally become due at the applicable maturity date. In
some cases, our interest income includes a paid-in-kind PIK component for
a portion of the total interest. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable loan agreement, is accrued
in accordance with the terms of such loan agreement and capitalized to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income.
The PIK interest added to the principal balance is typically amortized and paid in accordance with the applicable loan agreement. In cases
where the loans do not amortize, the PIK interest is collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal. We also generate revenue from
original issue discounts OID ), which is also recognized as interest income from loans over the initial term of the applicable
loans. Delayed draw loans may earn interest or unused fees on the undrawn portion of the loan, which is recognized as interest income
in the period earned. Other fees, including prepayment fees and exit fees, are also recognized as interest income when received. Any such
fees will be generated in connection with our loans and recognized as earned in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 

Expenses 

Our primary operating expense is the payment of
Base Management Fees and Incentive Compensation under our Management Agreement with our Manager and the allocable portion of overhead
and other expenses paid or incurred on our behalf, including reimbursing our Manager for a certain portion of the compensation of certain
personnel of our Manager who assist in the management of our affairs, excepting only those expenses that are specifically the responsibility
of our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including
(without limitation) fees and expenses relating to: 

organizational and offering
expenses; 

quarterly valuation expenses; 

fees payable to third parties
relating to, or associated with, making loans and valuing loans (including third-party valuation firms); 

fees and expenses associated
with investor relations and marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events); 

accounting and audit fees and expenses from our independent
registered public accounting firm; 

federal and state registration
fees; 

any exchange listing fees; 

federal, state and local taxes; 

independent directors 
fees and expenses; 

brokerage commissions; 

costs of proxy statements,
stockholders reports and notices; and 

costs of preparing government
filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC.

Income Taxes 

We are a Maryland corporation that elected to
be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable period ended December 31, 2021. We believe that our method of operation
will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled,
since qualification as a REIT depends on us satisfying numerous asset, income and distribution tests which depends, in part, on our operating
results. 

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational
and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable
income prior to the deduction for dividends paid. To the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income in any tax
year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax
at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of 1) 85 of our ordinary income
for the calendar year, 2) 95 of its capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any undistributed shortfall from its prior
calendar year (the Required Distribution to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared
by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay a non-deductible excise tax equal to
4 of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The 90 distribution requirement does
not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must
notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. Our stockholders must include their proportionate
share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT s tax
on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible
4 excise tax. If it is determined that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions
(including capital gain dividend) for the current year from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income
as such taxable income is earned. The annual expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Excise tax expense is
included in the line item income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period ended December 31, 2021, we did not
incur excise tax expense. 

Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes ASC
740 ), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We have analyzed our various federal and state filing positions
and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Based
on our evaluation, there is no reserve for any uncertain income tax positions. Accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included
within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Factors Impacting our Operating Results 

The results of our operations are affected by a
number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and
the supply of, and demand for, commercial real estate debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which
includes the accretion and amortization of OID, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the
loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of loan, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our
borrowers, competition and other factors, some of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted
by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers. 

69 

Changes in Market Interest Rates and Effect on Net Interest Income 

Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors,
including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors
beyond our control. We will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations. 

Our operating results will depend in large part
on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing. The cost of our borrowings generally will be based on
prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase (a) while the
yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate loan assets will remain static, and (b) at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged
floating-rate loan assets, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such
decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase.
Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target investments. If
any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely
affect our liquidity and results of operations. 

Interest Rate Cap Risk 

We currently own and intend to acquire in the future
floating-rate assets. These are assets in which the loans may be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which
limit the amount by which the asset s interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to
our financing agreements may not be subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate
costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps, while the interest-rate yields on our floating-rate assets would effectively
be limited. In addition, floating-rate assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being
deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of cash income from such assets in an amount that is
less than the amount that we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings. 

These factors could lower our net interest income
or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
As of December 31, 2022, all of our floating rate loans have interest rate floors, and one loan is subject to an interest rate cap. 

Interest Rate Mismatch Risk 

We may fund a portion of our origination of loans,
or of loans that we may in the future acquire, with borrowings that are based on the Prime Rate or a similar measure, while the interest
rates on these assets may be fixed or indexed to the Prime Rate or another index rate. Accordingly, any increase in the Prime Rate will
generally result in an increase in our borrowing costs that would not be matched by fixed-rate interest earnings and may not be matched
by a corresponding increase in floating-rate interest earnings. Any such interest rate mismatch could adversely affect our profitability,
which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders. 

Our analysis of risks is based on our Manager s
experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity.
Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by our Manager and our management may produce results that differ significantly
from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results. 

Market Conditions 

We believe that favorable market conditions, including
an imbalance in supply and demand of credit to cannabis operating companies, have provided attractive opportunities for non-bank lenders,
such as us, to finance commercial real estate loans and other loans that exhibit strong fundamentals but also require more customized
financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can presently provide. Additionally, to the extent that additional
states legalize cannabis, our addressable market will increase. We intend to continue our track record of capitalizing on these opportunities
and growing the size of our portfolio. 

70 

Risk Management 

To the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT
qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring
our portfolio and actively managing the financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity (a measure of the sensitivity of the
duration of a loan to changes in interest rates) risks associated with holding our portfolio of loans. Generally, with the guidance and
experience of our Manager: 

we manage our portfolio through
an interactive process with our Manager and generally service our self-originated loans through our Manager s servicer; 

we invest in a mix of floating-and
fixed-rate loans to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio; 

we actively employ portfolio-wide
and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing our Manager s risk management
tools such as software and services licensed or purchased from third-parties and proprietary analytical methods developed by our Manager;
and 

we seek to manage credit risk
through our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available
and appropriate. In addition, with respect to any particular target investment, prior to origination or acquisition our Manager s
investment team evaluates, among other things, relative valuation, comparable company analysis, supply and demand trends, shape-of-yield
curves, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. 

Recent Developments 

Updates to Our Loan Portfolio during Fiscal Year 2022 

For the
period January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2022, we closed credit facilities with three new borrowers which had aggregate commitments of
 75 million, 57.5 million of which was advanced at closing. Additionally, we advanced 29.2 million in aggregate principal on existing
credit facilities to seven different borrowers. 

For the period April 1, 2022 through June 30,
2022, we closed a credit facility with one new borrower, which included an aggregate commitment of 17.0 million, all of which was advanced
at closing. Additionally, we advanced 34.2 million in aggregate principal on existing credit facilities to seven different borrowers. 

71 

For the period July 1, 2022 through September
30, 2022, we closed one credit facility with a new borrower, which had an aggregate commitment of 9.0 million, 5.0 million of which
was advanced at closing. Additionally, we sold a senior secured loan to an affiliate under common control. The selling price of approximately
 6.7 million was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board. The fair value approximated the carrying value of the loan plus accrued
and unpaid interest through the selling date. Further, we assigned 10.0 million of unfunded commitment of a senior secured loan to an
affiliate and we advanced approximately 680 thousand in aggregate principal on an existing credit facility to one borrower. 

For the period October 1, 2022 through December
31, 2022, we refinanced and closed two credit facilities with two existing borrowers, which had an aggregate commitment of 43.1 million,
both of which were fully funded at closing. Additionally, we advanced approximately 3.4 million in aggregate principal on existing credit
facilities to three borrowers. 

Subsequent Updates to Our Loan Portfolio 

On January 12, 2023, we advanced approximately
 0.2 million in aggregate principal on an existing credit facility to one borrower. On January 24, 2023, we refinanced and closed one
credit facility with an existing borrower, which resulted in a paydown of 18.3 million in aggregate principal. On January 24, 2023, we
also purchased a senior secured loan from an affiliate under common control. The purchase price of approximately 19.0 million was approved
by the Audit Committee of the Board. The fair value approximated the carrying value of the loan plus accrued and unpaid interest through
January 24, 2023. On January 24, 2023, we also closed one credit facility with a new borrower, which had an aggregate commitment of 11.3
million, which was fully funded at closing. On March 6, 2023, we advanced approximately 0.7 million in aggregate principal on an existing credit facility to one borrower.

We
commenced operations on March 30, 2021 and, therefore, the comparative period for the year ended December 31, 2022 is from March 30, 2021
(inception) to December 31, 2021 (the Prior Period or period ended December 31, 2021 ). Differences in the
results of operations compared to the Prior Period are mainly due to the Prior Period only including approximately nine months of operations
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Results for the initial periods of our operations are not indicative of the results we expect
when our investment strategy has been fully implemented and proceeds from our IPO are fully deployed. 

Interest income increased as we deployed approximately 160.2 million of capital subsequent to December 31, 2021 as a result of our initial public offering. Further driving the increase was an increase in the Prime Rate from 3.25 as of December 31, 2021 to 7.50 as of December 31, 2022, impacting the Company s loans which bear a floating rate as well as new fundings of approximately 281.6 million. The weighted average yield of the Company s portfolio was 19.7 and 18.6 , respectively. 

The increase in interest income was offset by a corresponding increase in interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed an additional 58.0 million on the revolving credit facility, which also bears interest at the Prime Rate plus an applicable margin and was subject to the Prime Rate increases throughout the year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred debt issuance costs of 323,779 related to the Third Amendment, which were capitalized and are subsequently amortized through maturity. The amortized debt issuance costs included in interest expense was 563,464 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest expense previously included only amortization of deferred financing costs for the period ended December 31, 2021. 

We incurred base management and incentive fees payable to our Manager of approximately 6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to approximately 802 thousand for the period ended December 31, 2021. The increase in base management and incentive fees payable to our Manager was primarily attributable to greater assets under management as well as greater origination fee offsets in the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 1.3 million, compared to approximately 187,000 for the period ended December 31, 2021 offset by an increase in weighted average equity as defined by the Management Agreement for the comparable period. In addition, pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreements executed by our Manager, dated June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, all base management fees that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021 were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date. 

73 

Pursuant to a Fee Waiver Letter Agreement executed by our Manager, dated
December 31, 2021, all Incentive Compensation that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from October 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021, as well as a portion of reimbursable expenses incurred during the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were voluntarily
waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date. 

Provision for current expected credit losses increased in the year ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to the period ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to declines in risk ratings (discussed below) from December
31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, which are not due to any borrower specific credit issues, but rather, are primarily due to our quarterly
re-evaluations of overall current macroeconomic conditions affecting our borrowers. As interest rates have risen over the year ended December
31, 2022, the ability of our borrowers to service their debt and fund operations has been reduced. The current expected credit loss reserve
represents 115 basis points of our aggregate loan commitments held at carrying value of approximately 351.4 million and was bifurcated
between (i) the current expected credit loss reserve (contra-asset) related to outstanding balances on loans held at carrying value of
approximately 3.9 million and (ii) a liability for unfunded commitments of 94,413. The liability is based on the unfunded portion of
loan commitments over the full contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit.
Management considered the likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the expected credit loss on the funded portion. We continuously
evaluate the credit quality of each loan by assessing the risk factors of each loan. 

Our Manager has incurred general administrative expenses on our behalf
and was reimbursed approximately 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the period ended December 31, 2021, all reimbursements
to our Manager from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021 for general and administrative expenses were voluntarily waived by our Manager and
not subject to recoupment at a later date. 

The increase in professional fees was primarily due to an increase in audit, legal, investor relations and third-party consulting fees in the normal course of business as we continued to increase our assets under management. 

The increase in stock based compensation expense was due to having a full year of restricted stock grants outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2022 as opposed to less than a month for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Loan Portfolio 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our portfolio included 22 and 21 loans
held for investment of approximately 339.3 million and 197.0 million of loans receivable, respectively. The aggregate originated commitment
under these loans was approximately 351.4 million and 235.1 million and outstanding principal was approximately 343.0 million and 200.6
million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our loan portfolio had a weighted-average yield-to-maturity
internal rate of return YTM IRR of 19.7 and 18.6 , respectively, and was substantially secured by real estate and, with
respect to certain of our loans, substantially all assets of the borrowers and certain of their subsidiaries, including equipment, receivables,
and licenses. YTM IRR is calculated using various inputs, including (i) cash and paid-in-kind PIK interest, which is capitalized
and added to the outstanding principal balance of the applicable loan, (ii) original issue discount OID ), (iii) amortization,
(iv) unused fees, and (v) exit fees. Certain of our loans have extension fees, which are not included in our YTM IRR calculations, but
may increase YTM IRR if such extension options are exercised by borrowers. 

74 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 83.1 and 53.2 , respectively, of our portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans that
pay interest at the Prime Rate plus an applicable margin and were subject to a Prime Rate floor. The Prime Rate was 3.25 for the period
from January 1, 2022 through March 16, 2022, increased to 3.50 effective March 17, 2022, increased to 4.00 effective May 5, 2022, increased
again to 4.75 effective June 16, 2022, increased to 5.50 effective July 28, 2022, increased to 6.25 effective September 22, 2022, increased
to 7.00 effective November 3, 2022, and increased again to 7.50 effective December 15, 2022. The below summarizes our portfolio as of

 Certain loans are subject to contractual extension options and may be subject to performance based on other conditions as stipulated in the loan agreement. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities stated herein as certain borrowers may have the right to prepay with or without a contractual prepayment penalty. The Company may also extend contractual maturities and amend other terms of the loans in connection with loan modifications.

 Total Commitment excludes future amounts to be advanced at sole discretion of the lender.

 P = Prime Rate and depicts floating rate loans that pay interest at the Prime Rate plus a specific percentage; PIK = paid-in-kind interest; subtotal represents weighted average interest rate. 

(5) 
 P I = principal and interest. I/O = interest only. P I loans may include interest only periods for a portion of the loan term. 

(6) 
 
 Estimated YTM includes a variety of fees and features that affect the
 total yield, which may include, but is not limited to, OID, exit fees, prepayment fees, unused fees and contingent features. OID is recognized
 as a discount to the funded loan principal and is accreted to income over the term of the loan. 
 
 The estimated YTM calculations require management to make estimates
 and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the timing and amounts of loan draws on delayed draw loans, the timing and collectability
 of exit fees, the probability and timing of prepayments and the probability of contingent features occurring. For example, certain credit
 agreements contain provisions pursuant to which certain PIK interest rates and fees earned by us under such credit agreements will decrease
 upon the satisfaction of certain specified criteria which we believe may improve the risk profile of the applicable borrower. To be conservative,
 we have not assumed any prepayment penalties or early payoffs in our estimated YTM calculation. Estimated YTM is based on current management
 estimates and assumptions, which may change. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

We may make modifications to loans, including loans that are in default.
Loan terms that may be modified include interest rates, required prepayments, maturity dates, covenants, principal amounts and other loan
terms. The terms and conditions of each modification vary based on individual circumstances and will be determined on a case by case basis.
Our Manager monitors and evaluates each of our loans held for investment and has maintained regular communications with borrowers regarding
the potential impacts on our loans. 

Non-GAAP Measures and Key Financial Measures and Indicators 

As a commercial real estate finance company, we
believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are Distributable Earnings, Adjusted Distributable Earnings, book value
per share and dividends declared per share. 

Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings 

In addition to using certain financial metrics
prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our performance, we also use Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings to
evaluate our performance. Each of Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance
with GAAP. We define Distributable Earnings as, for a specified period, the net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding
(i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items
recorded in net income (loss) for the period; provided that Distributable Earnings does not exclude, in the case of investments with a
deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not
yet received in cash, (iv) provision for current expected credit losses and (v) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain
non-cash charges, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of
such independent directors. We define Adjusted Distributable Earnings, for a specified period, as Distributable Earnings excluding certain
non-recurring organizational expenses (such as one-time expenses related to our formation and start-up). 

78 

We believe providing Distributable Earnings and
Adjusted Distributable Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to stockholders
in assessing the overall performance of our business. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable
income and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of such taxable income. Given
these requirements and our belief that dividends are generally one of the principal reasons that stockholders invest in our common stock,
we generally intend to attempt to pay dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income, if and to the extent
authorized by our Board. Distributable Earnings is one of many factors considered by our Board in authorizing dividends and, while not
a direct measure of net taxable income, over time, the measure can be considered a useful indicator of our dividends. 

Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable
Earnings should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP net income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Distributable
Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar
supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our reported Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs.

GAAP net income to Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings (in thousands, except per share data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential
cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions
to our stockholders, and meet other general business needs. We use significant cash to invest in loans, repay principal and interest on
our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders, and fund our operations. 

Our primary sources of cash generally consist
of unused borrowing capacity under our financing sources, the net proceeds of future offerings of equity or debt securities, payments
of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating results. On a long-term basis, we
expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit facilities and (b) public and
private offerings of our equity and debt securities. We may utilize other sources of financing to the extent available to us. As the cannabis
industry continues to evolve and to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, the demand for capital continues to increase
as operators seek to enter and build out new markets. In the short-term, we expect the principal amount of the loans we originate to increase
and that we will need to raise additional equity and/or debt financing to increase our liquidity. We expect to achieve this through recycling
capital from loan paydowns, repayments, and sales of common stock related to our shelf registration statement. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of our cash
was unrestricted and totaled approximately 5.7 million and 80.2 million, respectively. We believe that our cash on hand, capacity available
under our Revolving Loan, and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to satisfy the operating requirements
of our business through at least the next twelve months. The sources of financing for our target investments are described below. 

Credit Facilities 

In May 2021, in connection with the Company s
acquisition of its wholly-owned financing subsidiary, CAL, the Company was assigned a secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving
Loan ). The Revolving Loan had an original aggregate borrowing base of up to 10,000,000 and bore interest, payable in cash in arrears,
at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (x) Prime Rate plus 1.00 and (y) 4.75 . The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 100,000
related to the origination of the Revolving Loan, which were capitalized and are subsequently being amortized through maturity. The maturity
date of the Revolving Loan was the earlier of (i) February 12, 2023 and (ii) the date on which the Revolving Loan is terminated pursuant
to terms in the Revolving Loan Agreement. 

On December 16, 2021, CAL entered into an amended
and restated Revolving Loan agreement (the First Amendment and Restatement ). The First Amendment and Restatement increased
the loan commitment from 10,000,000 to 45,000,000 and decreased the interest rate, from the greater of the (1) Prime Rate plus 1.00 
and (2) 4.75 to the greater of (1) the Prime Rate plus the applicable margin and (2) 3.25 . The applicable margin is derived from a floating
rate grid based upon the ratio of debt to equity of CAL and increases from 0 at a ratio of 0.25 to 1 to 1.25 at a ratio of 1.5 to 1.
The First Amendment and Restatement also extended the maturity date from February 12, 2023 to the earlier of (i) December 16, 2023 and
(ii) the date on which the Revolving Loan is terminated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Loan agreement. The Company has the option
to extend the initial term for an additional one-year term, provided no events of default exist and the Company provides the required
notice of the extension pursuant to the First Amendment and Restatement. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 859,500 related
to the First Amendment and Restatement, which were capitalized and are subsequently being amortized through maturity. 

On May 12, 2022, CAL entered into a second amended
and restated Revolving Loan agreement (the Second Amendment and Restatement ). The Second Amendment and Restatement increased
the loan commitment from 45,000,000 to 65,000,000. No other material terms of the Revolving Loan were modified as a result of the execution
of the Second Amendment and Restatement. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 177,261 related to the Second Amendment and Restatement,
which were capitalized and are subsequently amortized through maturity. 

On November 7, 2022, CAL entered into a third amended
and restated Revolving Loan agreement (the Third Amendment and Restatement ). The Third Amendment and Restatement increased
the loan commitment from 65,000,000 to 92,500,000. No other material terms of the Revolving Loan were modified as a result of the execution
of the Third Amendment and Restatement. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 323,779 related to the Third Amendment and Restatement,
which were capitalized and are subsequently amortized through maturity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unamortized debt issuance costs
related to the Revolving Loan and the First, Second and Third Amendments and Restatements of 805,596 and 868,022, respectively, are
recorded in other receivables and assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Revolving Loan incurs unused fees at a rate of
0.25 per annum which began on July 1, 2022 pursuant to the Second Amendment and Restatement. Additionally, during the year ended December
31, 2022, the Company borrowed 58.0 million against the Revolving Loan, which incurred an effective interest rate of 7.75 including
the unused fee rate of 0.25 , and 34.5 million available under the Revolving Loan. 

The Third Amendment and Restatement provides for certain
affirmative covenants, including requiring us to deliver financial information and any notices of default, and conducting business in
the normal course. Additionally, the Company must comply with certain financial covenants including: (1) maximum capital expenditures
of 150,000, (2) maintaining a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.35 to 1, and (3) maintaining a leverage ratio less than 1.50
to 1. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants with respect to the Revolving Loan. 

80 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed 58.0 million,
had 58.0 million outstanding, and 34.5 million available under the Revolving Loan as of such date. For the period ended December 31,
2021 we did not borrow against the Revolving Loan and therefore had 0 outstanding and 45 million available under the Revolving
Loan as of such date. 

On February 27, 2023, CAL entered into the First Amendment
to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. This amendment extended the contractual maturity date of the Revolving
Loan until December 16, 2024. The Company retained its option to extend the initial term for an additional one-year period, provided no
events of default exist and the Company provides 365 days notice of the extension pursuant to this amendment. 

Capital Markets 

We may seek to raise further equity capital and
issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments in loans.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we reported Net cash provided by operating activities of 17.0 million and 6.7 million, respectively. Net cash flows provided
by operating activities increased 10.3 million, primarily attributable to an increase in net income of 22.8 million, partially offset
by an increase in accretion of OID of approximately 2.3 million, increase in PIK interest of approximately 6.1 million, increase in
provision for current expected credit losses of approximately 3.7 million, increase in amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of
approximately 0.5 million, increase in stock based compensation of approximately 0.4 million, increase in interest receivable of approximately
 0.8 million, increase interest reserve of approximately 11.2 million, increase in management and incentive fees payable of approximately
 1.6 million, and increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and related party payables of 1.7 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing
Activities 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we
reported Net cash used in investing activities of 125.2 million and 145.2 million, respectively. 

The year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted
by cash outflows primarily related to 149.7 million used for the origination and funding of loans held for investment, partially offset
by 6.7 million received from the sales of loans and 17.7 million of cash received from the principal repayment of loans held for investment. 

The period ended December 31, 2021 was impacted
by cash outflows primarily related to 159.9 million used for the origination and funding of loans held for investment, partially offset
by 4.9 million received from the sales of loans and 9.8 million cash received from the principal repayment of loans held for investment. 

Net Cash Provided by
Financing Activities 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we
reported Net cash provided by financing activities of 33.7 million and 218.8 million, respectively. 

The year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted
by cash inflows of approximately 58.0 million related to draw downs on our Revolving Loan and approximately 4.5 million received from
the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option, partially offset by approximately 28.2 million in dividends
paid, approximately 0.5 million in debt issuance costs paid, and approximately 0.1 million related to offering costs associated with
our initial public offering. 

The period ended December 31, 2021 was impacted
by cash inflows of approximately 226.0 million related to proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, partially offset by approximately
 5.1 million in dividends paid, approximately 1.2 million of offering costs relate to our initial public offering, and approximately
 0.9 million related to debt issuance costs paid. 

Leverage Policies 

Although we are not required to maintain any particular
leverage ratio, we expect to employ prudent amounts of leverage and, when appropriate, to use debt as a means of providing additional
funds for the acquisition of loans, to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. Leverage is primarily used to provide
capital for forward commitments until additional equity is raised or additional medium- to long-term financing is arranged. This policy
is subject to change by management and our Board. 

Dividends 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for United
States federal income tax purposes and, as such, anticipate annually distributing to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable
income, prior to the deduction for dividends paid and our net capital gain. If we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income
in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we
will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of (i) 85 of our
ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and (iii) any Required Distribution
to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the
subsequent year), then we are required to pay non-deductible excise tax equal to 4 of any shortfall between the Required Distribution
and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. The
90 distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital
gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders
must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed
to have paid the REIT s tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may
be subject to the nondeductible 4 excise tax. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income (including net capital gain)
will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gains dividends) for the current year from such income, we accrue
excise tax on a portion of the estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. 

To the extent that our cash available for distribution
is less than the amount required to be distributed under the REIT provisions of the Code, we may be required to fund distributions from
working capital or through equity, equity-related or debt financings or, in certain circumstances, asset sales, as to which our ability
to consummate transactions in a timely manner on favorable terms, or at all, cannot be assured, or we may make a portion of the Required
Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
GAAP which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties. In accordance
with SEC guidance, the following discussion addresses the accounting estimates that we believe apply to us based on the nature of our
operations. Our most critical accounting estimates involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty that have had or are reasonably
likely to have a material impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments
used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are based upon reasonable assumptions given the information available to us at that
time. Our critical accounting estimates will be expanded over time as we fully implement our strategy. Those accounting estimates that
we believe are most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management
judgment are discussed below. 

CECL Reserve 

In accordance with ASC 326, we record allowances
for our loans held for investment. The allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets to present the net carrying
value of the amounts expected to be collected on such assets. The Company estimates its CECL Reserve using among other inputs, third-party
valuations, and a third-party probability-weighted model that considers the likelihood of default and expected loss given default for
each individual loan based on the risk profile for approximately three years after which we immediately revert to use of historical loss
data. 

ASC 326 requires an entity to consider historical
loss experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the macroeconomic environment. We consider multiple
datapoints and methodologies that may include likelihood of default and expected loss given default for each individual loans, valuations
derived from discount cash flows DCF ), and other inputs including the risk rating of the loan, how recently the loan was
originated compared to the measurement date, and expected prepayment, if applicable. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL
is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments. 

We evaluate our loans on a collective (pool) basis
by aggregating on the basis of similar risk characteristics as explained below. We make the judgment that loans to cannabis-related borrowers
that are fully collateralized by real estate exhibit similar risk characteristics and are evaluated as a pool. Further, loans that have
no real estate collateral, but are secured by other forms of collateral, including equity pledges of the borrower, and otherwise have
similar characteristics as those collateralized by real estate are evaluated as a pool. All other loans are analyzed individually, either
because they operate in a different industry, may have a different risk profile, or have maturities that extend beyond the forecast horizon
for which we are able to derive reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

83 

Estimating the CECL Reserve also requires significant
judgment with respect to various factors, including (i) the appropriate historical loan loss reference data, (ii) the expected timing
of loan repayments, (iii) calibration of the likelihood of default to reflect the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio, and (iv)
our current and future view of the macroeconomic environment. From time to time, we may consider loan-specific qualitative factors on
certain loans to estimate our CECL Reserve, which may include (i) whether cash from the borrower s operations is sufficient to cover
the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and (iii) the liquidation
value of collateral. For loans where we have deemed the borrower/sponsor to be experiencing financial difficulty, we may elect to apply
a practical expedient, in which the fair value of the underlying collateral is compared to the amortized cost of the loan in determining
a CECL Reserve. 

To estimate the historic loan losses relevant to
our portfolio, we evaluate our historical loan performance, which includes zero realized loan losses since our inception of operations.
Additionally, we analyzed our repayment history, noting we have limited true operating history, since the incorporation
date of March 30, 2021. However, our Sponsor has had operations for the past two fiscal years and has made investments in similar loans
that have similar characteristics, including interest rate, collateral coverage, guarantees, and prepayment/make whole provisions, which
fall into the pools identified above. Given the similarity of the structuring of the credit agreements for the loans in our portfolio,
management considered it appropriate to consider the past repayment history of loans originated by the Sponsor in determining the extent
to which we should record a CECL Reserve. 

In addition, we review each loan on a quarterly
basis and evaluate the borrower s ability to pay the monthly interest and principal, if required, as well as the loan-to-value (LTV)
ratio. In considering the potential current expected credit loss, the Manager primarily considers significant inputs to our forecasting
methods, which include (i) key loan-specific inputs such as the value of the real estate collateral, liens on equity (including the equity
in the entity that holds the state-issued license to cultivate, process, distribute, or retail cannabis), presence of personal or corporate
guarantees, among other credit enhancements, LTV ratio, ratio type (fixed or floating) and IRR, loan-term, geographic location, and expected
timing and amount of future loan fundings, (ii) performance against the underwritten business plan and our internal loan risk rating and
(iii) a macro-economic forecast. Estimating the enterprise value of our borrowers in order to calculate LTV ratios is often a significant
estimate. We rely primarily on comparable transactions to estimate enterprise value of our portfolio companies and supplement such analysis
with a multiple-based approach to enterprise value to revenue multiples of publicly-traded comparable companies obtained from S P
Capital IQ as of the quarter end, to which we apply a private company discount based on our current borrower profile. These estimates
may change in future periods based on available future macro-economic data and might result in a material change in our future estimates
of expected credit losses for our loan portfolio. 

Regarding real estate collateral, we generally cannot
take the position of mortgagee-in-possession as long as the property is used by a cannabis operator, but we can request that the court
appoint a receiver to manage and operate the subject real property until the foreclosure proceedings are completed. Additionally, while
we cannot foreclose under state Uniform Commercial Code UCC and take title or sell equity in a licensed cannabis business,
a potential purchaser of a delinquent or defaulted loan could. 

In order to estimate the future expected loan losses
relevant to our portfolio, we utilize historical market loan loss data obtained from a third-party database for commercial real estate
loans, which we believe is a reasonably comparable and available data set to use as an input for our type of loans. We expect this dataset
to be representative for future credit losses whilst considering that the cannabis industry is maturing, and consumer adoption, demand
for production, and retail capacity are increasing akin to commercial real estate over time. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable
forecast period, we revert back to historical loss data. 

All of the above assumptions, although made with
the most available information at the time of the estimate, are subjective and actual activity may not follow the estimated schedule.
These assumptions impact the future balances that the loss rate will be applied to and as such impact our CECL Reserve. As we acquire
new loans and our Manager monitors loan and borrower performance, these estimates will be revised each period. 

84 

Risk Ratings 

We assess the risk factors of each loan, and assign
a risk rating based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, payment history, real estate collateral coverage, property
type, geographic and local market dynamics, financial performance, enterprise value of the portfolio company, loan structure and exit
strategy, and project sponsorship. This review is performed quarterly. Based on a 5-point scale, our loans are rated 1 through
 5, from less risk to greater risk, which ratings are defined as follows:

The risk ratings are primarily based on historical
data and current conditions specific to each portfolio company, as well as consideration of future economic conditions and each borrower s
estimated ability to meet debt service requirements. The declines in risk ratings shown in the following table from December 31, 2021
to December 31, 2022 consider borrower specific credit history and performance and quarterly re-evaluation of overall current macroeconomic
conditions affecting its borrowers. As interest rates have increased due to rising rates from the Federal Reserve Board, it has impacted
borrowers ability to service their debt obligations on a global scale. This decline in risk ratings had an effect on the level
of the current expected credit loss reserve, though the loans continued to perform as expected. For approximately 82 of the portfolio,
the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral exceeded the amounts outstanding under the loans as of December 31, 2022. The
remaining approximately 18 of the portfolio, while not fully collateralized by real estate, was secured by other forms of collateral
including equipment, receivables, licenses and/or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations
governing such borrowers. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value,
excluding the CECL Reserve, of the Company s loans within each risk rating by year of origination is as follows:

shown in the original year of origination. Originations prior to March 30, 2021 were acquired in connection with our formation. 

Credit Risk 

We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk
in connection with our loans and interest receivable. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate loans, and may in
the future acquire loans, of higher quality at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive
review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated and acquired loans. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could
occur that could adversely impact our operating results. None of our borrowers are now, or have previously been in payment or otherwise
material default under their respective loan agreements with us. 

We expect to be subject to varying degrees of
credit risk in connection with holding our portfolio of loans. We will have exposure to credit risk on our commercial real estate loans
and other targeted types of loans. Our Manager will seek to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential
assets and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. 

85 

Credit risk will also be addressed through our
Manager s on-going review, and loans will be monitored for variance from expected prepayments, defaults, severities, losses and
cash flow on a quarterly basis. 

Our Manager or affiliates of our Manager have
originated all of our loans and intend to continue to originate our loans, but we may in the future also acquire loans from time to time.
Our Investment Guidelines are not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that
we may in the future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and
our qualification as a REIT. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response
to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage
of our capital that will be invested in any individual target investment at any given time. 

Our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021
was concentrated with the top three borrowers representing approximately 29.4 and 34.6 of the funded principal and approximately 27.9 
and 9.7 of the total commitments to borrowers, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the top three borrowers represented approximately
29.3 and 15.3 of interest income, respectively. The largest loan represented approximately 10.9 and 15.0 of the funded principal and
approximately 10.2 and 12.8 of the total commitments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company measures current expected credit losses CECL for loans held for investment based on Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326, Financial
Instruments Credit Losses ASC 326 ). The Company early adopted ASU 326 at formation, which introduces a new credit
loss methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk.
The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss methodology for the recognition of credit losses for loans
and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. CECL amended the previous credit loss model to reflect
a reporting entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current conditions,
but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The allowance for credit losses
(the CECL Reserve required under ASU 326 is deducted from the respective loans amortized cost basis on the Company s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in Accounts payable and
accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime
credit losses. 

Refer to footnote 3 to our consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, titled Loans Held for Investment, net for more information on CECL. 

Income Taxes 

We are a Maryland corporation that elected to
be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable period ended December 31, 2021. We believe that our method of operation
will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled,
since qualification as a REIT depends on us satisfying numerous asset, income and distribution tests which depend, in part, on our operating
results. 

86 

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational
and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable
income prior to the deduction for dividends paid and our net capital gain. To the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our REIT
taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of
the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of
1) 85 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, 2) 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any Required
Distributions to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year
but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay a non-deductible excise tax equal to 4 of any shortfall between the Required
Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The 90 distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital
gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular
corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital
gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT s tax on their proportionate share of the
retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4 excise tax. If it is determined
that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gain dividend)
for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The annual
expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Excise tax expense is included in the line item income tax expense. 

FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ),
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We have analyzed our various federal and state filing positions
and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported as of December 31, 2022. Based on our
evaluation, there is no reserve for any uncertain income tax positions. Accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included within other
liabilities in the balance sheets.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary
course of our business. These risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates. Our loans are typically valued using a yield analysis,
which is typically performed for performing loans to borrowers. Changes in market yields may change the fair value of certain of our loans.
Generally, an increase in market yields may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of our loans, however this is mitigated
to the extent our loans bear interest at a floating rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had 18 floating-rate loans, representing approximately
83.1 of our loan portfolio based on aggregate outstanding principal balances, subject to a Prime Rate floor. We estimate that a hypothetical
100 basis points increase in the Prime Rate would result in an increase in annual interest income of approximately 2.8 million and a
100 basis points decrease in the Prime Rate would result in a decrease in annual interest income of approximately 2.8 million. Our loans
generally have a Prime Rate floor of 3.25 . 

In addition, our Revolving Loan is exposed to
similar market risks. Changes in market rates may change the fair value of our Revolving Loan as our loan bears interest at the great
of (1) the Prime Rate plus the applicable margin and (2) 3.25 . As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of 58.0 million
under the Revolving Loan. We estimate that a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in the Prime Rate would result in an increase in annual
interest expense of approximately 0.6 million and a 100 basis points decrease in the Prime Rate would result in a decrease in annual
interest expense of approximately 0.6 million. 

Risk Management 

To the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT
qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring
our portfolio and actively managing the financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity (a measure of the sensitivity of the
duration of a loan to changes in interest rates) risks associated with holding our portfolio of loans. Generally, with the guidance and
experience of our Manager: 

we manage our portfolio through
an interactive process with our Manager and service our self-originated loans through our Manager s servicer; 

we invest in a mix of floating-rate and fixed-rate loans to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio; 

we actively employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing our Manager s risk management tools such as software and services licensed or purchased from third-parties and proprietary analytical methods developed by our Manager; and 

we seek to manage credit risk through our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. In addition, with respect to any particular target investment, prior to origination or acquisition our Manager s investment team evaluates, among other things, relative valuation, comparable company analysis, supply and demand trends, shape-of-yield curves, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. 

88 

Market Conditions 

We provide loans to established companies operating
in the cannabis industry which involves significant risks, including the risk of strict enforcement against our borrowers of the federal
illegality of cannabis, our borrowers inability to renew or otherwise maintain their licenses or other requisite authorizations
for their cannabis operations, and such loans lack of liquidity, and we could lose all or part of any of our loans. 

We believe that favorable market conditions, including
an imbalance in supply and demand of credit to cannabis operating companies, have provided attractive opportunities for non-bank lenders,
such as us, to finance commercial real estate loans and other loans that exhibit strong fundamentals but also require more customized
financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can presently provide. Additionally, to the extent that additional
states legalize cannabis, our addressable market will increase. While we intend to continue capitalizing on these opportunities and growing
the size of our portfolio, we are aware that the competition for the capital we provide is increasing. 

Our ability to grow or maintain our business depends
on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. New laws that are adverse to our borrowers may be enacted, and current favorable state
or national laws or enforcement guidelines relating to cultivation, production and distribution of cannabis may be modified or eliminated
in the future, which would impede our ability to grow and could materially adversely affect our business. 

Management s plan to mitigate risks include
monitoring the legal landscape as deemed appropriate. Also, should a loan default or otherwise be seized, we may be prohibited from
owning cannabis assets and thus could not take possession of collateral, in which case we would look to sell the loan, which could result
in us realizing a loss on the transaction. 

While we believe the principal amounts of our
loans are generally adequately protected by underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal
value of certain loans, particularly those not fully collateralized by real estate. In order to mitigate that risk, our loans are generally
collateralized by other assets, such as equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable
laws and regulations. In addition, we seek to impose strict loan covenants and seek personal or corporate guarantees for additional protection.
As of December 31, 2022, 89 of our portfolio is fully secured by real estate and 11 has limited or no real estate collateral. Our portfolio
on average had real estate collateral coverage of 1.7x as of December 31, 2022, and all of our loans are secured by equity pledges of
the borrower and all asset liens. As of December 31, 2021, 92 of our portfolio was fully secured by real estate and 8 had limited or
no real estate collateral. Our portfolio on average had real estate collateral coverage of 2.2x as of December 31, 2021, and all of our
loans were secured by equity pledges of the borrower and all asset liens. 

89 

Credit Risk 

We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk
in connection with our loans and interest receivable. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate loans, and may in
the future acquire loans, of higher quality at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive
review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated and acquired loans. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could
occur that could adversely impact our operating results. F or additional information regarding the
credit risk associated with our loans and interest receivables, see Risk Factors Loans to relatively new and/or
small companies and companies operating in the cannabis industry generally involve significant risks. 

Our Manager or affiliates of our Manager have originated
all of our loans and intend to continue to originate our loans, but we may in the future also acquire loans from time to time. Our Investment
Guidelines are not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that we may in the
future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and our qualification
as a REIT. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities
available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our capital that
will be invested in any individual target investment at any given time. 

Real Estate Risk 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to volatility
and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions
(which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness
in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar
codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower
to repay the underlying loan or loans, as the case may be, which could also cause us to suffer losses.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Chicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from March 30, 2021
(inception) to December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period
from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We have served as the Company's
auditor since 2021.

of the Company s
REIT taxable income prior to the deduction for dividends paid. To the extent that the Company distributes less than of its REIT taxable
income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code),
the Company will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if the Company distributes less than the
sum of 1) of its ordinary income for the calendar year, 2) of its capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any undistributed
shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution to its stockholders during any calendar year (including
any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then it is required to pay a non-deductible
excise tax equal to of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The distribution
requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if the Company elects to retain any of its net capital gain
for any tax year, it must notify its stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders
must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed
to have paid the REIT s tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain and receive an income tax credit for such
amount. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible excise tax. If it is determined that the Company s
estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gain dividend) for the
current year from such income, the Company accrues excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The
annual expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the forms and rules of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

In connection with the preparation of this annual
report on Form 10-K, our management, including the CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022 to ensure that (a) information required to be
disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the forms and rules of the SEC and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO
and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

As of December 31, 2022, our management remediated the
material weakness previously identified as of December 31, 2021 relating to inadequate design and implementation of information technology
general controls that prevented the information systems from providing appropriate segregation of duties, and delivery of complete and
accurate information consistent with financial reporting objectives and current needs. Our management also remediated the material weakness
relating to inadequate design and implementation of controls relating to the development of risk ratings and CECL reserves. While these
control deficiencies did not result in a misstatement, it could have resulted in a misstatement to the investment balances. 

Management remediated the material weakness related
to information technology general controls described above by hiring additional personnel, engaging an independent fund administrator
and designing and implementing formal user access controls. Management remediated the material weakness related to the development of
its CECL reserves by designing and implementing more robust procedures and controls over the preparation and review of risk ratings and
the estimation of enterprise value of the Company s borrowers, as well as over the preparation and review over the development of
reasonable and supportable forecasts of the performance of the Company s borrowers and the related loans. 

As a result of the remediation activities described
above, our management has concluded that the controls were designed appropriately and at a sufficient level of precision, and have been
operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, such that the material weaknesses previously identified as of December 31, 2021
have been remediated as of December 31, 2022. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our CEO and Interim CFO, evaluated, as of December 31, 2022, the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting using the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and Interim CFO concluded
that our internal controls, as of December 31, 2022, were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no material changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN

FIRST AMENDMENT TO THIRD

THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO THIRD AMENDED
AND RESTATED LOAN AND

the financial institutions party to the Loan Agreement from time to time as Lenders, [ ] BANK , an [ ] state banking association,

NOW, THEREFORE ,
in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter contained in the Loan Agreement, the parties agree as follows: 

1. Recitals;
Definitions . The foregoing recitals, including all terms defined therein, are incorporated herein and made a part hereof. Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement. 

2. Amended
Definitions . The following definition contained in Section 1.1 of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted, and the following is
inserted in its stead: 

Revolver Termination Date :
December 16, 2024, subject to extension pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.5 . 

3. 
 Extension of the Revolver Termination Date . Clause (b) of Section 2.5 is hereby deleted, and the following is inserted
in its stead: 

(b)
Borrower shall notify Agent and the Lenders of its irrevocable election to extend the Revolver Termination Date as aforesaid not earlier
than three hundred sixty-five (365) days, and no later than thirty (30) days, prior to the Revolver Termination Date. 

4. 
 Conditions Precedent; Representation . This Amendment shall become effective upon satisfaction of each of the following
conditions precedent: 

(i) 
 Agent shall have received a copy of this Amendment, duly executed by Borrower, each of the Lenders and Agent; 

(ii) Agent shall
have received a fully executed Third Amended and Restated Fee Letter; 

(iii) 
 Guarantor shall have executed and delivered to Agent a Reaffirmation of Guaranty in form and substance acceptable to Agent; and 

(iv) Borrower

The date on which all of such
conditions precedent are so satisfied is hereinafter referred to as the First Amendment
Effective Date . 

5. 
 Reaffirmation of Representations and Warranties; Ratification . Borrower hereby reaffirms each of the warranties and
representations contained in the Loan Agreement and the Loan Documents as if each such representation and warranty were made on the date
hereof. Further, Borrower represents and warrants to Agent that as of the date hereof, there are no existing and continuing Defaults or
Events of Default. Except as specifically amended above, the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and
effect. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the terms of this Amendment are not intended to and do not effect a novation of the
Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document. Borrower hereby ratifies and reaffirms each of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents
and all of its obligations thereunder. 

6. 
 Continuing Effect . Except as otherwise specifically set out herein, the provisions of the Loan Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect. 

7.

in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and performed in such state, without regard to the
principles thereof regarding conflicts of laws. 

8. 
 Counterparts . This Amendment may be executed in any number of separate original counterparts (or telecopied counterparts
with original execution copy to follow) and by the different parties on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Amendment by facsimile, e-mail or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Amendment. 

2 

9. 
 No Waiver . The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of any right,
power or remedy of Lenders or Agent under the Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Agent expressly reserves every right,
power and remedy specifically provided by the Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any related documents, now or hereafter existing
at law, in equity or by statute and each and every right, power and remedy, whether specifically given by Borrower or otherwise existing,
which may be exercised from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by Agent and the exercise or beginning
of the exercise of any such right, power or remedy shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter
any other right, power or remedy. Agent and Borrower may have had discussions regarding the Loan and Agent anticipates that additional
discussions may take place in the future. During the course of such discussions, Agent and Borrower may touch upon and potentially reach
a preliminary understanding on one or more issues prior to concluding negotiations. Notwithstanding this fact and absent an express written
waiver by Agent, Agent will not be bound by an agreement on any individual issue unless and until an agreement is reached on all issues
and such agreement is reduced to writing and signed by Agent and Borrower. As of the date of this letter, there are no offers outstanding
from Agent to Borrower nor are there any oral agreements among Agent and Borrower concerning the Obligations. Rather, all agreements concerning
the Obligations are expressed only in the existing Loan Documents, and the respective duties and obligations of the Borrower and Agent
shall be only as set forth in the Loan Documents. 

10. 
 References . Upon the effectiveness of this Amendment each reference in (a) the Loan Agreement to this Agreement, 
 hereunder, hereof, or words of similar import and (b) any other Loan Document to the Agreement 
or the Loan Agreement shall, in each case and except as otherwise specifically stated therein, mean and be a reference to
the Loan Agreement as amended hereby. 

11. 
 Releases; Indemnities . Borrower hereby agrees that its obligation to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees harmless
as set forth in the Loan Agreement shall include an obligation to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees harmless with respect to any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
incurred by the Indemnitees, or any of them, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from or relating to
any proceeding by, or on behalf of, any Person, including, without limitation, officers, directors, agents, trustees, creditors, partners
or shareholders of Borrower, whether threatened or initiated, asserting any claim for legal or equitable remedy under any statute, regulation
or common law principle arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, performance, administration
and enforcement of this Amendment or any other document executed in connection herewith, other than arising out of such Indemnitees 
gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The foregoing
indemnity shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Amendment, the Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.
