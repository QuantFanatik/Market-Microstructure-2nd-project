ORGANIZATIONAL
HISTORY 

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 30, 2013, under the name Bling Marketing, Inc. . Until December 29,
2014, we were a wholesaler of jewelry, principally earrings, rings, and pendants BMI Business ). We recognized a minimal
amount of sales from operations before the three months ending June 30, 2014, and were accordingly classified as a shell company. During
the three-month ended June 30, 2014, we began working with several distributors to sell our jewelry products to retail outlets and, as
a result, recognized sales revenue of 22,025 during the said period. On September 11, 2014, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K indicating
that we were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act in light of our operations through the quarter that
ended June 30, 2014. 

On
December 26, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Nugene Merger Agreement with NuGene Inc., a California
corporation NuGene ). On December 29, 2014 (the Closing Date ), we filed a certificate of merger in the State
of California whereby our subsidiary, NG Acquisition Inc. Acquisition Sub ), merged with NuGene. As a result, NuGene, the
surviving entity, became our wholly owned subsidiary. The transaction under the Nugene Merger Agreement was deemed to be a reverse merger,
whereby the Company (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and NuGene is considered the accounting acquirer, and
NuGene (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. The assets, liabilities, and operations of the acquired entity, NuGene,
were brought forward at their book value, and no goodwill was recognized. 

In
connection with the NuGene Merger Agreement, we entered into a Business Transfer and Indemnity Agreement dated December 29, 2014 (the
 Indemnity Agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer and Director, Dena Kurland providing for: 

1. 
 The
 transfer of our jewelry business operations existing on the date of the Indemnity Agreement (the BMI Business 

2. 
 The
 assumption by Ms. Kurland of all liabilities of our Company and the indemnification by Ms. Kurland holding our Company harmless for
 any and all liabilities arising at or before the date of the Indemnity Agreement; 

3. 
 The
 payment by NuGene to Ms. Kurland of 350,000 in cash; and 

4. 
 The
 surrender by Ms. Kurland of 15,000,000 shares (before giving effect to the Stock Split discussed below) (the Indemnity Shares of our Company s common stock representing 95 of the then outstanding common stock (all of which shares have been deemed cancelled
 by the Company). 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Nugene Merger Agreement, 26,052,760 shares of Company common stock and 1,917,720 Company a newly designated Series
A Preferred Stock were issued to the former NuGene shareholders. The Series A Preferred Stock was: (i) initially convertible into common
stock at a ratio of one to one, (ii) as long as there were a minimum of 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock had the right to elect a majority of the board of directors and (iii) the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock, generally voting as a class with the holders of common stock, had for each share of Series A Preferred Stock three times the number
of votes permitted to each share of common stock. 

On
December 26, 2014, our board of directors approved a 15.04 to one stock split Stock Split in the form of a stock dividend
to holders of our common stock as of that date. To affect that board action, each recipient of the stock dividend would receive 14.04
additional shares of common stock for every share of common stock held. 

4 

On
December 29, 2014, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to 18 purchasers Stock Placement for
proceeds totaling 2,000,000, including (a) 1,625,000 of cash and (b) automatic conversion of promissory notes in the principal amount
of 375,000. 

NuGene
was incorporated in California in December 2006 and formed and funded by our founders, Ali Kharazmi and Mohammed Kharazmi, M.D. The initial
focus of NuGene was to develop and market customized skin care products. As part of that focus, NuGene sought to leverage the working
relationships developed by our founders with the plastic surgery community. NuGene directed significant time and resources on developing
anti-aging and scar treatment/reduction products. 

In
2007 Nugene continued to focus on age-defying products utilizing peptide complexes (see further description below)
and nano-encapsulation for absorption into the skin (see additional description below). We introduced a limited product line under
the NuGene name and co-branded the products with an affiliated entity, Genetic Institute of Anti-Aging, Inc. GIAA ), which
the Kharazmi owned. We utilized the services of a Korean-based contract manufacturer to supply our products. This product line (the GIAA
Line was based on peptides and did not utilize stem cells. We had very modest sales in 2007, with our sole customer GIAA, a related
party. 

In
2008 we stopped production of the GIAA Line, and sales were limited to selling the remaining inventory through medical offices and GIAA.
With the GIAA Line discontinued, we spent the remainder of 2008 considering different formulations and methodologies for improved anti-aging
products. 

In
2009 and 2010, we had limited activity and minimal sales. Our sales were mainly overseas and limited to the remaining inventory of the
GIAA Line. We continued to explore how we might advance our formulations and methodologies. We expended funds on research and development,
carried out mainly by scientists engaged by the Company. 

In
2011 our founders decided to use adult adipose human stem cells (undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that multiply by cell
division to replenish dying cells and regenerate tissues) as the foundation of the formulation for its products. In 2011 the Company
developed a proprietary process to extract human adult stem cells from fat cells that the Company then used in its customized NuGene
line explicitly made for those client(s). Throughout 2011 we continued to provide autologous, or mature, fat-derived stem cells for use
in clinical procedures utilizing this technology. Through this process, the Company refined its ability to culture adult human stem cells
to render human-conditioned stem cell media at a proprietary concentration, a primary ingredient in the NuGene line of cosmeceuticals.
The Company believes that this proprietary concentration, combined with our unique formulations, will provide NuGene with a significant
competitive advantage. 

In
2012 we completed our initial line of cosmeceutical products based on these adipose-derived stem cells. We branded this advanced skincare
line solely under the NuGene name (the NuGene Line ). We eliminated the unpleasant odor associated with stem cells by adding
a fragrance with a very low incidence of allergic reaction. The packaging of this new product line bears no resemblance to the prior
GIAA Line. We also manufactured the NuGene Line ourselves at a small laboratory facility that we leased from an affiliated entity owned
by one of our founders. 

Throughout
2013 we continued to expand the product offerings of the NuGene Line. The Company focused its stem cell work on surgical and orthopedic
regeneration. These services were delivered to one client, which was an affiliated entity. Sales of the NuGene Line were limited as we
were in an initial rollout and branding phase. 

During
2014, we focused our efforts on transitioning to a cosmeceutical skincare business for mass distribution. With this transition and expanded
attention to our consumer products, we sought to develop our marketing plan and distribution channels. By the end of 2014, we had wholesalers
distributing products from the NuGene Line to medical offices and medical spas throughout the United States. December 31, 2014, we had
about 50 locations selling our products. In addition to the NuGene Line, we generated revenues from an affiliate, Advanced Surgical Partners ASP ), which is also owned by our CEO and Chairman of the Board, Messrs. Ali and Mohammed Kharazmi, respectively. Revenues
generated from ASP resulted from NuGene providing Plasma Rich Platelet and Stem Cell injections for orthopedic and plastic surgery procedures
to ASP. We provided these products and services to ASP as we transitioned into commercializing our cosmeceutical product lines. We expect
further to minimize these product sales and services to ASP in early 2015. 

5 

Our
target customers primarily consisted of middle-aged men and women concerned with their aging skin and hair loss. Although our distributors
were primarily west of the Mississippi River, our products were sold throughout the United States. 

By
2017, our cosmeceutical skincare business had been discontinued as we could not obtain financing for operations on reasonable terms and
became inactive. Our corporate charter was revoked in Nevada. 

On
January 26, 2020, Emergent, LLC Emergent ), a Nevada LLC controlled by Milan I Hoffman, was appointed the custodian of
the Company and proceeded to revive the Company s existence and resolve its outstanding indebtedness. This was completed as to
all indebtedness except for one convertible rate promissory note of 120,000. In March 14th, 2022, Ms. Hoffman sold her Series A Preferred
stock in the Company and certain shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Livento Group, LLC. Also in March 2022, David Stybr, our CEO and
the sole owner of Livento Group, LLC, agreed to contribute Livento Group, LLC to the Company in exchange for a transfer to him of the
Series A Preferred Stock which gave Mr. Stybr voting control of the Company. The Series C Preferred Stock purchased by Livento Group,
LLC was cancelled. As a result of these transactions our current operations are the operations of Livento Group, LLC. 

David
Stybr, CEO and Founder inserted the shares of Livento Group LLC into NuGene International, Inc. and received A class voting shares and
5 mil of C class shares. 

Livento
Group operations started in 2017 as the internal team spearheaded the development of financial management software based on artificial
intelligence for investment entities. This software currently provides several clients with data processing and analytical services in
the investment management sector. Management believes that this segment of our operations will provide meaningful revenue, but we can
give no assurance that this will happen. The product is best described as an automated system that can analyze large quantities of data,
focusing on selected parameters and predicting short-term future behavior within a specific portfolio of selected assets. The software
chooses assets with the highest potential based on a set of specifications and properties, predicting short-term future behavior within
a particular portfolio. 

In
2020 the Company acquired land for a residential real estate development project, amounting to 4 million USD, with a completion target
of late 2022. The property is being developed into 16 residential condominiums in a suburb of Prague in the Czech Republic, and all of
the condominium units have signed purchase agreements totaling 12 million. The development cost was approximately 3 million USD. Accordingly,
the gross profits from this project (not counting carrying costs) will be about 5 million USD. The Company had one more real estate project
in the planning phase but planned to sell it and not develop the property further. The Company invested in a residential project total
amount of around 825,000 USD and is currently looking for a buyer. We have had discussions with three potential buyers and expect to
finalize a contract of sale by the end of 2022 but can give no assurances that this will occur or that any sale of this project will
prove profitable. We do not have any further plans to engage in additional real estate development projects. 

Present
Operations 

The
Company formed BOXO Productions, Inc., a Delaware corporation BOXO ), on June 17, 2022 as a wholly owned subsidiary. BOXO
previously operated as a division of Livento that operated since 2020, where we meet with top film and movie producers. BOXO s
business model is strongly oriented toward the growing demand for content to fill cinemas after COVID19 and the expansion of online content
distributors. BOXO Productions will hold all assets related to Company s business in movies in the future and currently doesn t
employ any personnel. In most of its projects, BOXO is not primarily dependent on the movie s success, as a distributor pays it
before the film is finalized and receives a share of the revenue from cinemas box office and home sales. BOXO plans to produce
up to 6 movies and 12 television productions during 2022. BOXO also intends to participate in other films based on management s
assessment of their potential success in cinemas already in the post-production phase. BOXO will focus on negotiating distribution agreements
that provide for its sharing in the box office sales of these movies. Scripts are chosen by BOXO s production team, which regularly
receives offers from authors commonly involved in the film industry. BOXO may acquire movie or television rights in various stages of
development. Less frequently, BOXO receives offers for participating in a project s post-production phase. BOXO finances movies
via internal resources, loans, and investors depending on the project s state of development and the Company s cash position. 

6 

During
2022 BOXO started production of three movies, Carnival of Killers, Wash Me in the River and Running Wild. These projects received an
initial investment from Livento of USD 400,000 each. Two of these projects, Carnival of Killers and Running Wild are expected to enter
the development stage of production competed in the summer of 2023 and filming and postproduction should end during 4Q 2024. The movie
Wash Me in the River was released in Q4 of 2022. 

We
are in early stages of producing other movies that will be announced during Q1 or Q2 of 2023 once all the relevant agreements are finalized. 

The
team has been involved either as producers, executive producers, or agents over the years on the following movies, which have been aired
both in theaters and streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video, Paramount, and Disney Plus: 

The
 Misfits; a 2021 Action/Thriller featuring Pierce Brosnan 

Packaging
 of Ironman movie 

Black
 Swan; a 2010 Drama/Thriller featuring Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Winona Ryder, and Vincent Cassel 

Extremely
 Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile; a 2019 Crime/Drama featuring John Malkovich and Zac Efron 

Marley
 Me; a 2008 Comedy/Drama featuring Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson 

The
 Last Full Measure; a 2019 War/Drama featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris 

Worth;
 a 2020 Drama featuring Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci Jr. 

American
 Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally; a 2021 Drama that features Al Pacino 

Best
 Sellers; a 2021 Drama/Comedy featuring Michael Caine and Cary Elwes 

Currently,
the Company s primary focus is the activities of BOXO Productions. As previously mentioned, new movies and television productions
are started monthly, with the target being six movies this year. The Company will use the proceeds of the condominium sales to fund the
activity and operations of BOXO. 

The
BOXO team is comprised of three consultants that have been in the production business for last 20 30 years and has experience
with large productions as the above-mentioned examples. They have together worked on approximately 300 movie projects over the years. 

The
Company does not plan to continue in its real estate activities, is finalizing its current projects, and will not pursue new opportunities
in this segment. The last remaining project, Thunder, was a proposed 52-unit condominium apartment building in Prague. We had an option
to purchase the parcel for the construction of the project but allowed the option to lapse. The parcel remains available and the project
now which consists of budget, architectural drawings, and project plans. We will endeavor to sell the project hopefully during 2023 but
can give no assurance that we will be successful in those efforts. Any buyer needs to secure the land and hire construction company to
build the project. Any proceeds from the sale of this project will be added to our general working capital. 

Trends
in the Our Markets 

Management
believes that the entertainment industry is experiencing structural changes. COVID19 changed the movie distribution business and offered
new business models and potential growth to participants who provide apps and streaming content directly to consumers through the Internet.
Based on management s analysis of recent market statistics and trends, we believe these models have become dominant trends in this
market segment. 

Management
also believes that these trends will continue and that there is a large market for BOXO s films and television productions. The
movie production market has expanded significantly in the last two years and is likely to continue growing significantly in the coming
years. Management has observed that online streaming platforms continually require new content, and an increased number of connected
devices will likely result in more customers using these services. In the next few years, many developed and emerging nations will add
new customers to the network. 

7 

The
Company has internally developed software called Elisee that can capture large amounts of data and create predictive behavior
based on client inputs that assist the client in establishing its investment portfolio. Successfully building an equity portfolio is
not simple since one must consider the future of particular industries and the companies within them. Retail investors and Family Offices
lack complex historical data, and this is where Elisee excels. This data has been acquired from Dow Jones and other public sources and
dissected and analyzed. We believe in diversification but place more emphasis on those industries and companies with a more promising
outlook based on guidance from Elisee. Management believes each potential customer s financial situation and investment needs are
unique. We see the constant shift of the world s financial markets, real estate prices, CPI data, and effective portfolio management
as the key to success. 

Elisee,
our software product, uses algorithms that read market data and neurological network abilities to determine the best path forward and
make ongoing corrections over time. The main idea is based on reducing risk by investing in several assets. Investors should approach
assets individually and carefully assemble them into their portfolios. When creating an optimal portfolio, Elisee constantly measures
two factors. The first factor is a parameter expressing potential profitability, and the second parameter represents risk. It is necessary
to consider the riskiness of the individual assets in the portfolio, their mutual covariance, or their mutual correlation to calculate
the risk of the entire portfolio. Covariance expresses the extent to which two investment instruments move in the same direction at a
specific time. 

Our
competitors are other A.I. database and algorithm programming companies delivering services to clients like banks and asset managers.
Elisee is diversification tool. 

The investor could create his portfolio from all the points in the picture. But only points E, N, and J form an admissible set suitable for the investor. This set is also bounded by the efficient frontier, characterized by the rational investor choosing only those portfolios that offer the maximum expected return for the specified amount of risk. And at the same time, he chooses a portfolio that provides him the minimum risk for the given amount of expected return. If the investor chooses point E, he can no longer create a better mix of stocks in his portfolio. If an investor establishes a portfolio from any combination lying on the efficient frontier, it will be the best possible portfolio combination in the given situation. 

We
identified this as a unique opportunity to support several companies with different needs and to aid them in their asset selection process.
We developed our system that can read large amounts of data and run portfolio analyses on these assets, providing improved portfolio
management and performance. 

The
system s development commenced in early 2018, and the first version took one year of development and testing with various basic
data sets. Currently, Livento has a team of three analysts who focus on the maintenance and further development of the system. We are

Marketing
Strategy 

Our
marketing strategy comprises the following components; social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, FB, etc.), PR and video communications, and a
personal approach. The strategy differs based on the product offered. They may be described as follows: 

Social
media: 

The
BOXO brand is currently. We can rapidly, quickly, and reliantly inform all stakeholders about necessary and relevant news. We use promotional
posts to gain company followers. 

PR
and video communications: 

A
professional IR agency was hired to write our PR communications, arrange interviews with Management, write articles, and introduce them
via different channels to the media. Video interviews and conference attendance are also planned for more prominent investors 
involvement. 

Personal
approach: 

Our
software uses a direct and personal approach via different marketing channels, including social networks, industry liaisons, and articles
in specialized magazines. 

Employees 

We
currently have eleven employees and consultants. Three of our employees are specialized in Elisee development, three are engaged in Financial
Management, and two are involved in administrative positions. The remaining employees are engaged in various management positions. We
anticipate hiring additional employees or consultants over the next three months to support the growth of BOXO. None of our employees
are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Competition 

BOXO
competes with other production companies focused on movies and online streaming platforms. Our main market advantage is direct contact
via the producer team to top Hollywood icons, including well-known producers, directors, actors, and distribution companies that pay
BOXO before the film is finalized. 

The
competition to our software is other software products performing similar functions. We differentiate ourselves in specializing and providing
a proven track record in several specific market segments, where we can offer predictive behavior of assets with and without our decision-making
process. 

In
all aspects of our business, we face competition from companies with more significant resources than we have, but we have gradually and
consistently grown despite this. 

We
currently occupy space within serviced office suites in New York City and Prague in the Czech Republic. Since our employees and consultants
work virtually, we believe this arrangement is adequate for us and allows us to operate at a very low cost. In the future, if we require
more office space, we will acquire appropriate quarters within which to operate.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The information and financial data discussed below is only
a summary and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this 10-K.
The financial statements contained elsewhere in this 10-K fully represent the Company s financial condition and operations; however,
they are not indicative of the Company s future performance. Although management believes that the assumptions made and expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the underlying assumptions will, in fact, prove
to be correct or that actual results will not be different from expectations expressed in this 10-K. 

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 

Overview 

We
primarily engage in developing BOXO projects development where our business model consists of financing new movies or engaging in a stage
before starting distribution. BOXO is paid once the distributor company comes into the project; thus, Livento can turn around the investment
equity quickly. 

AI
product has current revenues from our clients in the form of fees for our services, and we invest part of these back into the product s
continuous upgrade. We provide our clients with analytical services where we use our software to deliver them requested portfolio setting,
and we charge an initial data analysis fee if the client uses the results of our software regularly; we charge fees based on the size
of assets he has under management and type of additional services he requires. We divide our prices based on the number of data sets
that need to be analyzed. 

BOXO
production revenues will be reflected further this year as the first projects enter a revenue stage. BOXO projects are currently in differing
stages of production. 

Our
current real estate project is in a revenue production phase as apartments are becoming subject to purchase contracts and sell. 

Recent
Developments 

In
Q1 2022, while the Convid-19 pandemic appeared to be ending, management decided to acquire Livento. We believe this strategy has secured
investors and attention for BOXO s efforts. 

New
movies are lined up every two weeks, and our producer team chooses the one with the highest added value for shareholders regarding current
cash flow and potential movie effects. 

Our
AI product continues in normal development, where our internal team is providing services to several investment houses for portfolio
optimization. 

During
end of 2022 we finalized the sale of the first part of our real estate project for amount 2,1 million which sales will continue during
Q1 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Critical
accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates, and uncertainties and potentially result
in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following are our critical accounting policies: 

11 

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

These
consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
are expressed in US dollars. 

The
basis of accounting differs in certain material aspects from that used for preparing the books of the Subsidiaries, which are prepared
by the accounting principles and relevant financial regulations applicable to limited liabilities enterprises established in their domicile.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect necessary adjustments not recorded in the books of the Subsidiaries to present
them in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

The
consolidated financial statement comprises the financial statement of Livento Group Inc. (The Company) and the subsidiaries Livento Group
LLC and BOXO Production Inc as of December 31, 2022. 

Subsidiary
- The Group consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and cash flows of the Company.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when the Company has power over the entity,
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. Assessment of control is based on the substance of the relationship between the Company and the entity and
includes consideration of both existing voting rights and, if applicable, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable and
convertible. The operating results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from month when control
is acquired (typically the acquisition date). The operating results of subsidiaries that are divested during the period are included
up to the date control ceased (typically the disposition date) and any difference between the fair value of the consideration received
and the carrying value of a divested subsidiary is recognized in the consolidated income statements. Accounting policies of subsidiaries
have been aligned with those of the Company where necessary. 

Functional
and presentation currency 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in the United States dollar USD ), the Company s reporting
currency. 

Related
parties 

The
Company adopted ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, to identify related parties and disclose related party transactions. 

A
related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10 or more of the Company s securities and their immediate families,
(ii) the Company s management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction
is considered a related party transaction when resources or obligations are transferred between related parties. Related parties may
be individuals or corporate entities. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company adopted ASC 606 requires using a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires
entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with
a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating
the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. The Company has concluded that the new guidance did not require any change
to its revenue recognition processes. 

The
Company recognizes software service fees over time as performance obligations are satisfied over the life of the service, usually, with
an average duration of one year. Payments received in advance from customers are recorded as Deferred revenues. Such advance
payments received are non-refundable after the thirty days refund period. 

12 

The
cost of revenue consists primarily of the outsourced information technology support service, internal employees, consultants, service
charges for cloud computing, and related expenses, which are directly attributable to the revenues.

 Revenue
 is recognized by the company not only when delivery note and invoice has been signed and confirmed by the customer, but at the end
 of each quarter over the 12 months period after service has been delivered to the customers. 
 
 When
 the company expects to be entitled to breakage (forfeiture of substandard services), the company recognizes the expected amount of
 breakage in proportion to the services provided versus the total expected network services to be provided. Any unexpected amounts
 of breakage are recognized when the unused value of network services expire

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. 

The
Company has tried to establish an ongoing and stable source of revenues and cash flows sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow
it to continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated a net loss of 487,158 as of December 31, 2022. The cash balances as of
December 31, 2022, were 24,159. These factors, among others, support the ability of the Company to continue to fulfill its targets. 

However,
management cannot assure that the Company will accomplish any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Readers
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on management s current expectations and projections
about future events, are not guarantees of future performance, are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions (including those described
below), and apply only as of the date of this filing. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the
results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, the risks discussed in prior filings, in press releases and in other communications to shareholders issued by
us from time to time which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors which may affect our business. We undertake
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or
otherwise.

Managements 
Discussion of the year ended December 31 2020 

During
2020, Livento Group LLC operated as development platform for its artificial intelligence software Elisee and real estate projects where
as well revenue of 750,267 was invoiced for consulting and management services. We are providing strategical, project and administration
services to several projects in Europe. Another 820,030 in revenues was share in real estate projects sales totaling revenues for 2020
to 1,570,297. 

Costs
were incurred mainly as professional fees in amount of 316,000 for people providing Elisee development and real estate projects consulting.
Other costs was 88,000 for computer and server rent that was used for development of several projects in IT sector, one of them was
as well Elisee. We are accounting for 267,000 as costs of goods sold that covered professional fees related to revenues. 

Our
long-term assets consisted of Elisee in amount of 3,320,030, real estate projects in amount of 236,700 and 5,045,789 and a movie project
in amount 1,580,600. 

Managements 
Discussion of the year ended December 31 2021 

In
2021, Livento Group LLC moved more forward as well in movie projects and started to shift its position from real estate towards movies.
We continued to develop Elisee platform for new clients in USA and our real estate projects started to being realized and developed.
Our revenue consists from 525,000 invoiced for Elisee and 1,315,866 for real estate management. 

Due
to high growth of the company, our professional fees increased in line with our revenues to 574,009 and Elisee and other IT focused
projects development took 334,500 for server and IT rent. We are accounting for 714,589 as costs of goods sold for Elisee and 345,000
for professional fees linked to consulting revenues. We as well officially had our first office that was in cost of 87,100. 

Company
ended in net loss of 214,879 that was caused mainly by amortization of Elisee software that we started fully used and sell in 2021.
Without amortization, the financial result of the company would be profit of 499,710 which would be decrease compared to year 2020 but
Company invested lot of revenues into movie projects and as well Elisee development in expectation of future revenue coming from these
investments. 

Our
long term assets consisted of Elisee in amount of 5,032,230, real estate projects in amount of 2,757,700 and 9,171,659 and movie projects
in amount 3,715,600. 

Managements 
discussion of the periods ended 2022 

Livento
Group was acquired by Nugene International, Inc., which subsequently changed its name to Livento Group, Inc. We had revenue of 1,966,202
during year 2022. These came from sales of Elisee and our management services to real estate projects. Elisee sales accounted for 1,066,000
and 900,202 for real estate projects and management services. 

Our
costs of goods sold consist of Amortization of Intangible Assets in amount of 1,677,410, Professional fees of key professionals and
consulting fee that is related to generation of income from the Elisee in amount of 393,879. Most of the revenue for the quarter that
ended December 31, 2022, was derived from software fees. Management believes that the increased revenues are related to our expanded
staffing. The main reason is the hiring of new investment representative people and intermediary consultants that support gaining new
clients. Our expenses were 482,347, mainly professional fees, contracted labor, cloud fees, servers, and legal expenses. We sold first
part of our real estate project with 100,000 profit and we seek to continue in this trend as real estate sales attitude is getting better
in European residential market in first quarter 2023. 

14 

Professional
fees increased during this period as we hired services to develop Elisee and more people in administration regarding the process of getting
change don t with NuGene International, Inc. Compared to the previous period, we took larger office space to accommodate more people s
needs. All of the above resulted in a net operation loss of 487,158. 

Because
of inflation, increased costs of construction, and smaller profit margins, we are transferring our focus to BOXO and Elisee. BOXO is
undertaking more projects and requires more investment than we can generate, and demand for Elisee is increasing due to current market
volatility. We believe the capital generated from the disposal of our real estate properties will provide the required cash for these
operations.

COVID-19
outbreak 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted
the global economy, workforce, and customers and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. It has also disrupted
the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. This outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our services
and harm our company and the results of operations. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse consequences
of the outbreak and its effects on our business or the results of operations at this time. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. 

 Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. 

We
had 24,159 cash on hand on December 31, 2022. This is adequate for our planned operations through the end of 2022. In addition, we anticipate
approximately 2,150,000 in revenue from second sale process of our real estate assets to be received during 1Q 2023 and other receivables
for Elisee and our management services in the amount of 489,910. To build the BOXO brand fully, the Company intends to rely on increased
net income and cash inflow in the coming year. In addition, we also plan to receive additional investments for our business through private
equity sales. However, we can give no assurance that we will realize the goals. 

Our
receivables are mainly due from clients using Elisee software as the clients were experiencing high market volatility and delayed several
payments. The situation is resolving and management anticipates that all delayed payments should be done received during Q1 2023. 

Our
billing for Elisee is generally quarterly, with payment up to 60 days, thus creating a need for working capital. 

Our
contracts for Elisee are generally 24 months, providing stable revenue and cash flow. We are engaged in the production of three movies,
where the first one should provide revenue during 1Q of 2023 and the others near the end of 2023. Our movie industry investments appear
on our balance sheet as these are not costs but direct investments as we acquire intellectual property in target movie companies. Each
movie is produced in separate company so risk of failure is mitigated for Livento as a holding company. 

Our
debt is mainly operational liabilities, including one 61,400 loan and payments for rent, professional fees, and marketing. We will pay
these outstanding amounts as they come due and our receivables come in the company. The Loan is to be repaid in 1Q 2023, and we believe
our cash flow will be sufficient to pay it. 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or
capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, obligations under any guaranteed contracts
or contingent obligations. We also have no other commitments, other than the costs of being a public company that will increase our operating
costs or cash requirements in the future. 

Seasonality 

Management
does not believe that our current business segment is seasonal to any material extent. 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 

We
do not have in effect any compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To
the Director and members of Livento Group, Inc 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Livento Group, Inc (the Company as of December 31, 2022,
and 2021 the related statements of operations, and cash flows , for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the related notes collectively referred to as the financial statements . 

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as
of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. As of December 31, 2022, there
are no critical audit matters to be communicated.

Cost
Capitalization 

The
cost of Real Estate includes the purchase price of the property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to planning,
developing, initial leasing and constructing a property are capitalized and classified as Real Estate in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Capitalized development costs include interest, property taxes, insurance, and other direct project cost incurred during the period of
development. 

ASC
970 Real Estate - General 

The
costs of Real Estate Projects include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential
to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs
and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available
for occupancy or sale upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction
activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we
capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. 

Real
Estate Held for Sale 

The
Company considers Real Estate to be assets held for sale when (1) management commits to a plan to sell the Real Estate; (2) the Real
Estate will be available for sale in its present condition and (3) the Real Estate will be marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable
given our estimate of current market value. Upon designation of a Real Estate as an asset held for sale, we record the Real Estate s
value at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value . 

Real
Estate Projects 

Real
Estate are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line and accelerated methods for financial and tax reporting purposes,
respectively, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings will have an estimated useful life of 20 years. Land is an indefinite
lived asset that is stated at fair value at date of acquisition. 

Revenue
Recognition 

On
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . Results for reporting periods beginning
after December 31, 2021, are presented under Topic 606. 

Under
Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue
recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific
pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that
a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures
and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. 

The
Company reviewed all agreements at the date of initial application and elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where
the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings on December 31, 2021. Considering
there was no revenue in prior periods, the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance had no transition impact. 

The
Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 

identification
 of the agreement, or agreements, with a buyer and/or investor; 

identification
 of the performance obligations in the agreement for the sale of lots including delivering title to the property being acquired from
 ILA; 

determination
 of the transaction price; 

allocation
 of the transaction price to the lots purchased when issued with equity or warrants to purchase equity in the Company; and 

recognition
 of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation such as delivering title to lots purchased. 

Revenue
is measured based on considerations specified in the agreements with our customers. A contract exists when it becomes a legally enforceable
agreement with a customer. The contract is based on either the acceptance of standard terms and conditions as stated in our agreement
of lot sales or the execution of terms and conditions contracts with third parties and investors. These contracts define each party s
rights, payment terms and other contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Consideration was historically paid prior to transfer of
title as stated above and in future land sales, the Company plans to transfer title to buyers at the time consideration has been transferred
if the acquisition of the property has been completed by the Company. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer s
ability and intention to pay, however collection risk is mitigated through collecting payment in advance or through escrow arrangements.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract or agreement to transfer a distinct product or item to the customer, which for us
is transfer of title to our buyers. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the property that will be
transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer
of the property is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. We have concluded the sale of property and delivering
title is accounted for as the single performance obligation. 

The
implementation of ASC 606, have a material impact of US on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Effective
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance of ASC 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial
Assets ASC 610-20 ), which applies to sales or transfers to noncustomers of nonfinancial assets or in substance nonfinancial
assets. Generally, the Company s sales of its real estate properties would be considered a sale of a nonfinancial asset as defined.
Under ASC 610-20, the Company will derecognize the asset and recognize a gain or loss on the sale of the real estate when control of
the underlying asset transfers to the buyer. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has US 
in revenue from the sale of real estate properties. As a result of the adoption of ASU 610-20, there was an impact to the Company s
consolidated financial statements.

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
of controls and procedures. 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance,
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over
time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

As
required by the SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021, at the reasonable assurance level due
to the material weaknesses described below. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard
No. 2) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following two material weaknesses which
have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
assurance level: 

1.
We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year ended December
31, 2021. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our
assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material
weakness. 

2.
We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature,
segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible,
the authorization of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.
The recording of transactions function is maintained by a third-party consulting firm whereas authorization and custody remains under
the Company s Chief Executive Officer s responsibility. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation
of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented
a material weakness. 

To
address these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements
included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the issuer s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the issuer s board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the issuer. 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As
of the end of our most recent fiscal year, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on that evaluation, they concluded that as of December 31, 2021, such internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely
affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The
matters involving internal control over financial reporting that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent
members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives
of having segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions and the custody of assets; and (3) lack of communication
between management and external accounting personnel. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer
in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2021. 

22 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1) and (2) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors,
result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result
in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only the management s report in this annual report. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: we will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within
the accounting function when funds are available to us. First, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control
objectives of having separate individuals perform (i) the authorization of transactions, (ii) the recording of transactions and (iii)
the custody of assets. Second, we will create a senior position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our
accounting procedures with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements
of accounting information. Third, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to
an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds
are available to us. Lastly, we will improve channels of communication between management and accounting through regularly scheduled
monthly meetings. We anticipate the costs of implementing these remediation initiatives will be approximately 50,000 to 100,000 a year
in increased salaries, legal and accounting expenses. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting. 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Annual Report
on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

or decrees material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director, executive officer, promoter, or control person of
the Company, including any allegations (not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated), permanent or temporary injunction, or any other

Corporate
Governance 

The
business and affairs of the company are managed under the direction of our board. Our board has two independent directors, Mr. Sanoval
and Mr. Zelezny. The Board has not yet established any committees. In addition to the contact information in this annual report, each
stockholder will be given specific information on how he/she can direct communications to the officers and our director of the corporation.

Role
in Risk Oversight

the most significant risks facing our company and our company s general risk management strategy, and also ensures that risks undertaken
by our company are consistent with the board s appetite for risk. While the board oversees our company s risk management,
management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective
approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our board leadership structure supports this approach.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.

24th of March, 2022, Livento Group, LLC, a company controlled be Mr. Stybr, transferred 100 of its shares to Nugene International Inc
in exchange of A class voting shares and C class shares, of net assets, this was an exchange of equity interests between entities under
the control of the same parent. 

Nugene
International Inc, recognized the net assets received at historical carrying amounts, as reflected in the parent s financial statements
of Livento Group, LLC. 

On
January 26, 2020, Emergent, LLC Emergent ), a Nevada LLC controlled by Milan I Hoffman, was appointed the custodian of
the Company and proceeded to revive the Company s existence and resolve its outstanding indebtedness. This was completed as to
all indebtedness except for one convertible rate promissory note of 120,000. In March 14th, 2022, Ms. Hoffman sold her Series A Preferred
stock in the Company and certain shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Livento Group, LLC. Also in March 2022, David Stybr, our CEO and

returned to designated, authorized, but unissued status, so that the Corporation can proceed to enter transactions for the benefit of
shareholders. 

Director
Independence 

We
believe that Mr. Sandoval and Mr. Zelezny, who do not own any securities of the Company and have never been employed by us are independent
directors. Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of independence 
of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director 
is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
Company s Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of
a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if: 

the
 director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company; 

the
 director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of 120,000 during any period of
 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including,
 among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

a
 family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company; 

the
 director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to
 which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed
 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); 

the
 director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three
 years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or 

the
 director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Company s outside auditor, or at any time during the
 past three years was a partner or employee of the Company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s audit. 

We
do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee. 

Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services. 

Audit
Fees 

For
the Company s fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022, we were billed approximately 10,000 and 15,000, respectively, for
professional services rendered for the audit and review of our financial statements. 

Audit
Related Fees 

There
were no fees for audit related services for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022. 

28 

Tax
Fees 

For
the Company s fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022, we were billed approximately 8,000 and 14,000 for professional
services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. 

All
Other Fees 

For
the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 we were billed approximately 55,450, for professional services rendered in connection
with our registration statement on Form 10. 

The
Company did not incur any other fees related to services rendered by our principal accountant for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2021, and 2022. 

Effective
May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before our auditor is engaged by us to render any
auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be: 

approved
 by our audit committee; or 

entered
 into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the audit committee, provided the policies and procedures are
 detailed as to the particular service, the audit committee is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include
 delegation of the audit committee s responsibilities to management. 

We
do not have an audit committee. Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. The pre-approval
process has just been implemented in response to the new rules. Therefore, our board of directors does not have records of what percentage
of the above fees was pre-approved. However, all of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors
either before or after the respective services were rendered.
