 REPORT ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE

STRATS TRUST FOR PROCTER GAMBLE SECURITIES, SERIES 2006-1 10-K 

 Exhibit
33.1 

ASSESSMENT
OF COMPLIANCE WITH 

 APPLICABLE
SERVICING CRITERIA 

Management
of The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The
Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s management has determined that the servicing criteria
are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: 

Platform :
Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed
securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation
AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services,
as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other
mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ). 

Period :
The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Applicable
Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements
as to any transaction, except as set forth in the column titled Not Applicable to Platform in Appendix 1 attached
hereto. 

With
respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company s management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required
by the servicing criterion. The Company s management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). The Company s management has policies
and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company s management is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related servicing criterion. 

With
respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of compliance in respect of the
Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1.
The Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2.
The Company s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion
for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above as of and for the Period. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3.
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is defined
in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements)
to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original
filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect
the Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction
agreements). As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform
such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the Company s responsibility
for criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust
assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to
perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. 

4.
Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. 

KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment
of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

Board of Directors 

 The
Bank of New York Mellon 

 BNY
Mellon Trust of Delaware 

 The
Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria that The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM
(Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively,
the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject
to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee,
securities administration, paying agent, or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements,
other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii),
1122(d)(4)(xiv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect
to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect to Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has determined that for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is
defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements)
to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original
filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect
the Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction
agreements). Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria indicates that as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt
of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the Company s responsibility for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i)
for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments
and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest
unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii),
the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with
respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.
Appendix A to Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed
transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

KPMG
LLP, a Delaware limited limited liability partnership and a member firm of 
the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with 
KPMG International Limited, a private English company Limited by guarantee. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable
assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions
and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to
the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures
were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions
or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements
relating to the examination engagement. 

As
described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for Servicing Criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The Company has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company
has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the Servicing Criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06).
As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the Servicing Criterion applicable to the vendor.
The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and
related Servicing Criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing
criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
