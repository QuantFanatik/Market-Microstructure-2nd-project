 In December
2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities
filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as
trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts.
Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the
Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche
Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs
assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged
failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers
for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of
alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following
alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix
Light s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and
subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s
decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The
Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors
and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar
allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed
substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of
defective mortgage loan documentation.

 The report on assessment of compliance for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022, furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation
AB by KeyBank National Association KeyBank ), as servicer, discloses that the
following material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to its
platform: 

 The examination
performed by Ernst Young LLP identified an instance of material
noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(4)(ix) of
Regulation AB applicable to KeyBank during the year ended December 31, 2022. During compliance testing, it was discovered,
that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within 45-60 days
before the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset documents.
Per the related note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60
days of any change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification
was not made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The
noncompliance in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which
is wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

 The following
remediation procedures have been initiated by KeyBank: (i) the impacted mortgage
loans are currently in the process of being identified, (ii) investor contact
has been initiated, (iii) corrective actions are being considered and will be
tracked and monitored by senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed
and revised, if necessary, to include new tracking and action steps to prevent
this situation from recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided
to the relevant staff members to prevent a recurrence.

Appendix B to the Company s
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the
beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare the
roles associated with its trustee, securities administration, paying agent
services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for
such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS Platform
transactions. During the Period, for all the CMBS Platform transactions, Wells
Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually
all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result,
the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the
servicing function with respect to the CMBS Platform and the applicable
servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by
Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing
Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not
taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the
Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS Platform, as of and
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means
agent.

THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the Company or Wells Fargo is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are
applicable in regard to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Sale
of Corporate Trust Services Business . 
On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ),
Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust
Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells
Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. See Appendix B 
for more information regarding such transition as it relates to the Document
Custody Platform (defined below). 

Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Platform : 
The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in
each case for which the Company was appointed to provide document custody
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January
1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS
transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an
exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
(the Document Custody Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s
sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any new
appointments to provide document custody services after November 1, 2021, other
than a few exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to
Computershare. Appendix A identifies the individual transactions
defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the
Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period : Management
has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect
to the Document Custody Platform transactions for the Period: Item
1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(1)(iv) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).
Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect
to the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the Company s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period. 

KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect
to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. 
As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to
Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and
liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the
Document Custody Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the
Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a
subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of
Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result,
the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the
servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the
applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by
Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing
Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means
agent.

RE:
Management s Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance by 

 Park
Bridge Lender Services LLC with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

Park
Bridge Lender Services LLC (the Asserting Party or PBLS is responsible for
assessing its compliance, as of and for the calendar year ended December 31,
2022 (the Reporting Period ), with the servicing criteria set forth in Title
17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

The
transactions covered by this assertion are those transactions processed by the
Asserting Party in its capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor for the
asset-backed securities transactions listed in Exhibit A attached hereto
(the Platform ). 

The
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R. 229.1122) to assess its
compliance. The full outline of the Asserting Party s contractually applicable
servicing criteria under various securitization pooling and servicing
agreements can be found in Exhibit B attached hereto. The servicing
criteria listed in the column title Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit
B hereto are not applicable to the Asserting Party based on the activities
it performs with respect to the Platform. 

Based
on its assessment, the Asserting Party believes that, as of and for the periods
the contractual obligations existed for the Platform in the Reporting Period,
the Asserting Party has complied in all material respects with the servicing
criteria listed in the column title Applicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit
B hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

FORVIS,
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

MANAGEMENT'S
ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 PURSUANT TO ITEM
1122 OF REGULATION AB 

Management
of Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark Newmark is responsible for assessing
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC relating to its
role in the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions
conducted by Newmark (the Platform as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ). Appendix A identifies the
individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as
constituting the Platform. 

Newmark's
management has assessed Newmark's compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria during the Reporting Period. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the SEC in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Appendix B, which
management has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities it
performs with respect to the Platform. 

With
respect to applicable servicing criteria identified in Appendix C, there were
no activities performed for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform,
because there was no occurrence of events that would require Newmark to perform
such activities. 

With
respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi) and
1122(d)(2)(vii), management has engaged Midland Loan Services, a division of
PNC Bank, National Association Midland to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. Newmark management has determined that
Midland is not a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and Newmark's management has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to Midland as permitted by
the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C D1 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06) 

 (formerly
SEC Regulation AB Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations,
17.06). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that Midland's activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to Midland. Newmark has not identified
and is not aware of any material instances of noncompliance by Midland with the
applicable servicing criteria during the Reporting Period, with respect to the
Platform taken as a whole, nor has it identified any material deficiencies in
its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by Midland with the
applicable servicing criteria during the Reporting Period with respect to the
Platform taken as a whole. Newmark is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for Midland and the
related criteria. 

Based
on such assessment, management believes that with respect to the Reporting
Period, Newmark has complied in all material respects with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the SEC, including
servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v),1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) for which
compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above relating
to its role in the servicing of the Platform. 

Ernst
and Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has Issued an
attestation report with respect to management's assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Reporting Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the
servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served
directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying agent,
and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new CMBS transactions for
which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related CMBS
Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of CMBS
Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had
not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS
Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the
Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the CMBS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is
taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities
performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. 

Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related
roles, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of
the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately
offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the
party for whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction
agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the
U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). 
 Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management
as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations,
or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent,
in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
CMBS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the
CMBS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS
Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the
Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and
the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing
Criteria ). 

Third
parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a
vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by
the servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in
the CMBS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties
by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. In each
case, Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the activities of each vendor
comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the
vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company
meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and
the related servicing criterion. 

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. Management is responsible
for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. Management has
assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including
the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 , as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and
1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

4. Based on such
assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare
Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of
the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

 For the Document Custody Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served
directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document
Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who
remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More
specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November
1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which,
during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document
Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant
majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during
all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the
related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role
Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the
Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during
all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual
duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the
Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking
responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the
Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. 

 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

 Platform : 
The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions,
and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for
which the Company provides document custody services ,
either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the
party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the
issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly
offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities
for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after
January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company
(and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies
the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

 Applicable Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations,
or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent,
in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates
to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents
related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the
transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included in the
Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain
aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security thereon, and
related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has
determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for
assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii)
applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for
determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

 With respect to the Document Custody
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

 1. Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

 2. Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

 3. With respect to Applicable
Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were
no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

 4. Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

MANAGEMENT'S
ASSERTION ON COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank
National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance
for the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1, 2022
through December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ), with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for the servicing criteria
which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on
Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to
the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial real
estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122
(d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by
the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2022, that required this
servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The
Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied,
in all material respects, except as discussed in Appendix C, with the
applicable servicing criteria for the transactions listed on Appendix A backed
by commercial real estate mortgage loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the
servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As permitted
by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors'
activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and
related criteria. 

Ernst
 Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

 Management s
Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 

 For
the Period of January 1 through December 31, 2022 

 Appendix
C 

KeyBank
National Association (KeyBank) has identified the following material instance
of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix) during the calendar
year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform. 

1) Servicing Criteria impacted 

1122(d)(4)(ix) Adjustments to interest
rates or rates of return for pool assets with variable rates are computed based
on the related pool asset documents. 

2) Material Instance of
Noncompliance with Servicing Criteria 

During compliance testing, it was
discovered, that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within
45-60 days before the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset
documents. Per the Note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60
days of any change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification
was not made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The
noncompliance in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which
is wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

3) Remediation 

The following remediation procedures have
been initiated by KeyBank: (i) the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the
process of being identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii)
corrective actions are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by
senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if necessary,
to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from
recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided to the relevant
staff members to prevent a recurrence.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors, The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the
accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC
Bank, National Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! sm 
Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the
year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B),
1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the servicing activities performed by them with respect to the
Platform. Midland s management is responsible for its assertion and for the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company
has engaged certain vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s
interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation
200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in
all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor.
The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related
criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation
200.06. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and
to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical
requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Midland complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for all transactions
serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System is fairly stated, in
all material respects.

 Wel l s Fargo Bank, Nati on al A s s o ciati o n: 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the
accompanying ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA,
that the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for
commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was
appointed to perform trustee, securities administration, paying agent services,
and/or related services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a
registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered
pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation
under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, (i) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and
(ii) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and
for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined
by Regulation AB) to a party other than Computershare Trust Company or any
affiliate thereof (the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022. Appendix A to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA identifies the individual asset-backed
transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the CMBS
Platform. 

Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(2)(vi) are
applicable to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to
the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with
respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. The Company s management
has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform activities with
respect to the CMBS Platform relating to those servicing criteria. Management
is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on
our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS
Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by
this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may
have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to
the examination engagement. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied
with the aforementioned Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects. 

We do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on the

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Berkeley
Point Capital LLC 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria Pursuant to Item
1122 of Regulation AB, that Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark (the
Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial
mortgage-backed securities transactions conducted by Newmark platform as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for Items 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii),
1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the
activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by
this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assessment of Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria Pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB for the
asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that
comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance
with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although
the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with items 1122(d)(4)(iii),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and
1122(d)(4)(xiv) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed
by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these
servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of Berkeley Point Capital LLC d/b/a Newmark and
to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v),
1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform
the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined
that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as
permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has
asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v),
1122(d)(2)(vi) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) for which compliance is determined based on
C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31,
2022 for the commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions platform, is
fairly stated, in all material respects.

We have examined management s

Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform that
Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for whom
it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and
for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction
agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to
the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an
addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the
transaction agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and
securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing
activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company
processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were
limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the
Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management has determined are
not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the

As
described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and

required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that
this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j)

servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholder

KeyBank National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as
successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate
mortgage loans platform, except for the instance of material noncompliance
described therein, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for
Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122 (d)(3)(ii),
1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined are not applicable
to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform
covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of management s assertion. See
Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset backed transactions covered
by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with
those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the
individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of
the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for
assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December
31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe
that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Our examination disclosed the
following material noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix)
applicable to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. With respect
to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix), the servicer did not consistently process
adjustments to interest rates in accordance with pool asset documents. 

We are required to be
independent of Key Bank National Association and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

As described in management s assertion,
for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a vendor to
perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to
the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all
material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company
is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, except for the
material noncompliance described in the third paragraph, the Company complied
with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122
(d)(4)(xi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as
described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance by Pentalpha Surveillance LLC with
Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria (Management s Assertion), that
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC)
Regulation AB for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual
obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (Platforms A and B), including
only those asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding the following criteria set forth in
Items 1122(d)(1)(i-v), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi)
and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv) for Platform A, and servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i-v),
1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi) and
1122(d)(4)(viii-xv) for Platform B, which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platforms covered by this report. Appendix B to management s assertion
identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as
constituting Platforms A and B. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of
the servicing activities related to Platforms A and B, determining whether the
Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset- backed transaction in Platforms A
and B. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising
from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may
have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Pentalpha Surveillance LLC complied
with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022, for Platforms A and B is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Members of 

 Argentic Services Company LP 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on
Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria Management s
Report ), that Argentic Services Company LP (the Company complied with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Commercial Mortgage Loans Platform
(the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii),
1122(d)(3)(iii),1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(ix),
1122(d)(4)(x),1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii),
1122(d)(4)(xiv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. The Platform consists of the asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management in its Management s Report. Management is responsible for
the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform
based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria for the Platform and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities constituting
the Platform and evaluating whether the Company performed servicing activities
related to those transactions and securities in compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria for the period covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing
may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed
transaction or security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was
not designed to detect material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to
the period covered by this report and that may have affected the Company s
servicing activities during the period covered by this report. We believe that
our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination
does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical
requirements relating to the engagement. 

As described in Management s Report, the
Company engaged various vendors to perform servicing activities with respect to
criteria 1122(d)(2)(vii). The Company determined that each vendor is not
considered a servicer, as that term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and therefore, the Company is assuming responsibility for compliance with
such servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. In
accordance with Regulation AB and its related interpretations, the requirement
for management to assess compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to a
vendor s activities is satisfied if the Company has instituted policies and
procedures to monitor whether such vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with such criteria. Compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
is achieved if those policies and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that such vendor s activities comply with such criteria and those
policies and procedures are operating effectively for the period covered by
Management s Report. Our examination does not provide a legal determination of
whether a vendor is or is not considered a servicer, and therefore, on whether
the Company, in its Management Report, is eligible to elect to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor s servicing activities. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that Argentic Services Company LP complied with the aforementioned applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the
Commercial Mortgage Loans Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
