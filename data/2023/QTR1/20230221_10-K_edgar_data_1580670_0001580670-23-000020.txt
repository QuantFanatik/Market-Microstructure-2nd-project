 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 General 
 We are engaged in the design, construction and sale of new homes in markets in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Alabama, California, Oregon, Nevada, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Our management team has been in the residential land development business since the mid-1990s. Since commencing home building operations in 2003, we have constructed and closed over 50,000 homes. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had 6,621 home closings, compared to 10,442 home closings in 2021. 
 LGI Homes, Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated on July 9, 2013. Our principal executive offices are located at 1450 Lake Robbins Drive, Suite 430, The Woodlands, Texas 77380, and our telephone number is (281) 362-8998. Information on or linked to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K unless expressly noted. 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires, LGI, the Company, we, our and us refer collectively to LGI Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Business Opportunities 
 Since our initial public offering in November 2013, we have grown substantially by expanding our operations from nine markets in four states to 35 markets in 20 states. We currently offer homes for sale in 99 communities throughout the United States. We focus on demographic and economic trends forecasted for these markets and expect to continue to grow. 
 Our sales and marketing-focused operating model has enabled us to enter new markets efficiently and profitably. We intend to continue to expand into new markets where we identify opportunities to develop communities and sell homes that meet our profit and return objectives. 
 Driven by commitment to our customers and our desire to make their dreams of homeownership a reality, we offer multiple product lines, including attached and detached entry-level homes and active adult offerings that are marketed and sold under our LGI Homes brand and luxury homes that are marketed and sold under our Terrata Homes brand. 
 During 2022, our average home completion time was approximately 90 to 165 days, our average home size ranged between 1,000 to 4,100 square feet and our overall sales prices ranged from approximately 190,000 to more than 1,200,000. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 6,621 homes at an average sales price per home closed of 348,052. During 2021, our average home completion time was approximately 90 to 130 days, our average home size ranged between 1,000 to 4,100 square feet and our overall sales prices ranging from approximately 150,000 to more than 1,100,000. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we closed 10,442 homes at an average sales price per home closed of 292,104. 
 We pursue a flexible land acquisition strategy of purchasing or optioning finished lots at attractive prices, or purchasing raw land for residential development. Given our successful history as a land developer, we are experienced in converting raw land into residential communities. We endeavor to maintain a pipeline of desirable land positions for replacement and new communities. We generally target land acquisitions that are further away from urban centers than many other suburban communities but have access to major thoroughfares, retail districts and centers of business. Such areas generally result in a better value for the homeowner, either through lower sales prices or larger lot sizes. We consider development opportunities that meet our profit and return objectives, including opportunities that may involve the sale of home sites as a part of the product mix. Projects of interest are typically evaluated at the division level using an extensive due diligence checklist that includes assessing the permitting and regulatory requirements, environmental considerations, local market conditions and anticipated floor plans, pricing and financial returns. We also determine the number of potential residents in the market and rental households that are within driving distance of the proposed project. We will continue to focus primarily on entry-level homebuyers. 
 Additionally, we engage in other business activities that leverage or complement our core homebuilding operations. Our wholesale business builds and sells homes to large institutions interested in acquiring single-family rental properties through bulk sales agreements. Beginning in 2021, we began building and leasing a number of single-family homes in select, existing communities. These rental projects are income producing and we maintain the option to sell these homes in a bulk purchase agreement. Finally, our strategic joint ventures, LGI Mortgage Solutions and LGI Insurance Solutions, provide mortgage financing and homeowners insurance services to our customers.

 During the second half of 2022, we experienced a slowdown in demand caused by the Federal Reserve s ongoing actions to stem inflation and the resulting increases in mortgage rates compared to the beginning of 2022. As a result, many buyers paused their home purchasing decisions. In response to this slowdown in buyer demand, we increased advertising spending to connect with more potential homebuyers. Beginning in September 2022, we began offering mortgage buy-down programs and other sales incentives to offset some of the affordability pressures resulting from higher mortgage rates and increased our allocation of inventory available for sale to our wholesale channel. Additionally, we evaluated our land position and significantly reduced our owned and controlled lots and right sized the number of finished homes in inventory. Given the market conditions experienced during the second half of 2022 and our continued focus on future community count growth, we have chosen to allocate available capital to near-term land development. 
 While we expect that many of these challenges will persist in 2023 and could potentially worsen, we believe the long-term outlook for new homes remains strong, driven by solid fundamentals, including a historically low inventory of new and existing homes for sale, an aging housing stock, rising rents, strong household formations and low unemployment. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our well-defined sales and marketing approach focuses on converting renters of apartments and single-family homes into homeowners. We use extensive digital and print advertising to attract potential homebuyers. We employ various marketing methods, such as interactive online media, social media, direct mail, directional signage, and billboards. These methods have proven highly successful in reaching our target market, placing potential homebuyers in front of our trained sales professionals and communicating our core messages of value and dream fulfillment. 
 While a proportion of our business comes from realtors, our marketing efforts are principally designed to connect directly with potential customers currently renting their residences and encourage them to schedule an in-person appointment at one of our information centers. Our information centers are typically open 11 hours per day, 359 days per year, and generally staffed by two to five sales professionals who are supported by a dedicated loan officer. 
 Our commission-based sales professionals are trained to learn about the current housing situation of the customer, educate them on the value proposition of owning an LGI home and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of the steps required to achieve homeownership. We also inform customers of our history, vision and values. Our sales professionals determine credit and income qualifications, provide floor plans and pricing information, and conduct tours of our homes based on the customer s needs and budget. We provide each customer with a comprehensive introduction to the community and the surrounding area, furnishing them with detailed information regarding utilities, schools, homeowners association dues and restrictions, local entertainment and nearby dining and shopping options. As a result of our transparent approach, customers receive all the information needed to make a buying decision, which we believe sets clear expectations and eliminates confusion during the home buying process. 
 
 Homebuilding Operations 
 Our homebuilding operations are organized and managed by seven operating segments: West, Northwest, Central, Midwest, Florida, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. The Midwest division is included in our Central reportable segment and the Mid-Atlantic division is included in our Southeast reportable segment. 
 We operate in the following markets within these seven operating segments: 
 West Northwest Central Midwest Florida Southeast Mid-Atlantic Phoenix, AZ Seattle, WA Houston, TX Minneapolis, MN Tampa, FL Atlanta, GA Washington, D.C. Tucson, AZ Portland, OR Dallas Ft. Worth, TX Orlando, FL Charlotte, NC Norfolk, VA Albuquerque, NM Denver, CO San Antonio, TX Fort Myers, FL Raleigh, NC Richmond, VA Las Vegas, NV Austin, TX Jacksonville, FL Wilmington, NC Baltimore, MD Northern CA Oklahoma City, OK Fort Pierce, FL Winston-Salem, NC Southern CA Daytona Beach, FL Columbia, SC Sarasota, FL Greenville, SC Birmingham, AL Nashville, TN

 These operating segments reflect the way we evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. Additional information on our operating segments and product information is contained in Note 15 Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We offer a set number of floor plans in each community with standardized finishes. Doing so enables us to utilize an even-flow, continuous construction process that is designed to efficiently build and maintain an inventory of move-in ready homes that are available for immediate sale. 
 We employ experienced construction management professionals to perform the tasks of general contractors for home construction in each of our communities. Our employees provide the purchasing, construction management and quality assurance for the homes we build, while third-party subcontractors provide the material and labor components of our homes. In each of our markets, we employ construction managers with local market knowledge and expertise. Additionally, our construction managers monitor our compliance with zoning, safety, and other regulations, production schedules, and quality standards for our projects. 
 We endeavor to obtain favorable pricing from subcontractors through long-term relationships and consistent workflow. A number of our trade partners have subcontracted on our projects since we commenced homebuilding operations in 2003. Consistency of our trade partners is an integral part of our homebuilding operations that also leads to reduced warranty costs. We believe in building long lasting relationships with our trade partners in order to provide consistent, quality and timely deliveries across our markets. We also work closely with our construction managers and subcontractors and train them using a comprehensive construction manual that outlines the most efficient way to build an LGI home. 
 Our homebuilding operations utilize a paperless purchase order system to conduct business with our subcontractors and suppliers. Our master build schedule allows our trade partners to receive their specific tasks from our electronic system and plan several weeks in advance before starting their work. This means of communication allows our subcontractors to schedule their crews efficiently, thereby allowing for better pricing and better quality of work. Typically, our contractors are paid every week, which contributes to the strength of our business relationships with them. 
 Our homes are designed to meet the preferences of our target market of potential homebuyers and enable cost efficient and effective construction processes. In 2019, we introduced our CompleteHome TM and CompleteHome Plus TM packages to continue our legacy of offering buyers well-appointed, move-in ready homes, a streamlined buying experience, and superior quality with even more standard features than offered before. Each of these packages includes preselected, upgraded features, including stainless steel appliances, cabinets with crown molding, granite or quartz countertops, undermount sinks, as well as convenient outlets with USB charging capability and a Wi-Fi-enabled garage door opener. Additionally, both packages include programmable thermostats, double-pane Low-E vinyl windows, LED flush mount ENERGY STAR lights and a variety of other energy-saving features. Our CompleteHome Plus package includes everything in the CompleteHome package plus 42 upper cabinets, nine-foot ceilings, designer paint selections, additional landscaping and window blinds in every room of the house. 
 We offer an attached townhome product in certain markets that enables us to keep our entry-level price point within reach of more new homebuyers. We believe that this product helps to counter rising land and home costs. 
 Our active adult communities offer affordable homes in both open and age-restricted lifestyles in amenity-rich communities. These communities leverage existing floor plans with minor modifications designed to meet the needs of active adult homebuyers at prices that present a compelling value-proposition. 
 Our Terrata Homes brand allows us to leverage our systems and processes, including our customer centric sales system, to deliver move-in ready homes with preselected luxury features. During 2022, we closed 217 Terrata Homes at an average sales price per home closed of 549,551, compared to 183 Terrata Homes at an average sales price per home closed of 482,410, in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we offered Terrata Homes in ten of our active communities. We expect that home closings in our Terrata Homes branded communities will be approximately 5.0 of our annual home closings during 2023. 
 Our mortgage financing and homeowners insurance joint ventures provide a streamlined, customer-focused experience for our homebuyers. LGI Mortgage Solutions provides mortgage services to our customers through an unconsolidated joint venture. LGI Insurance Solutions provides homeowners and other insurance products to our customers through an unconsolidated joint venture. 
 Our wholesale business provides opportunities for us to leverage our even-flow construction methodology to build and sell homes to large institutions interested in acquiring homes to be used as rental properties, primarily through bulk sales agreements. During 2022 and 2021, we had 1,233 and 1,515 wholesale home closings, respectively, which represented 18.6 and 14.5 of our total home closings in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect our wholesale business to represent approximately 5 to 10 of our annual home closings during 2023.

 Land Acquisition Policies and Development 
 We continue to be an active and opportunistic acquirer of land for residential development in our markets. We source land from a wide range of landowners, brokers, lenders, builders and other land development companies. We generally acquire raw land and finished lots in affordable locations that are further away from urban centers than many other suburban communities but have access to major thoroughfares, retail districts and centers of business. We conduct thorough due diligence on each of our potential land acquisitions, and we typically look at numerous opportunities before finding one that meets our requirements. We also maintain a pipeline of desirable land positions for replacement communities and new communities. 
 Our lot inventory decreased to 71,904 owned or controlled lots as of December 31, 2022 from 91,845 owned or controlled lots as of December 31, 2021 primarily related to controlled lots that were terminated during the second and third quarters of 2022 to manage our overall inventory. Additionally, during 2022, we experienced intermittent delays that lowered the lot counts and have been compounded by nationwide inflationary headwinds. 
 We had 99 and 101 active communities as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The overall decrease in community count is seen as transitory, primarily due to the close out of active communities and to a lesser extent available finished lots in certain active markets. Generally, it takes us two to three years to turn raw or undeveloped land into an active community. To mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks, we utilize, on a limited and strategic basis, land banking financing arrangements. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into several land banking financing arrangements with a third-party land banker to repurchase land that we sold to the land banker as a method of acquiring finished lots in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and minimizing the use of funds from our available cash or other financing sources. In consideration for this repurchase option, we paid a non-refundable commitment fee. Based on our right to control the ultimate economic outcome of these finished lots, these assets will be held as real estate not owned within our inventory and a corresponding obligation was established within our accrued liabilities to recognize this relationship. While we are not legally obligated to repurchase the balance of the lots, we will be subject to certain performance obligations, financial and other penalties if the lots are not purchased. We do not have any ownership interest or title to the assets that we have sold to the land banker and we do not guarantee any of the land banker s liabilities. 
 Our allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to portfolio management. Our Acquisitions Committee meets periodically and consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President of Acquisitions. Annually, our divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographic areas. Supply and demand are analyzed to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. The long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to our experience in the marketplace and is then adjusted to the extent necessary. 
 We have also purchased larger tracts of land across our markets which will provide us with more opportunities to build homes with multiple price points in our communities. We believe that our land development expertise will allow us to meet our growth and profit objectives with respect to opportunities in which we are the developer. Similar to our home building operations, our personnel oversee the contractors who perform the development work. Our land development projects may include the sale of home sites or commercial property as a part of the project. 
 We have strong relationships with the land brokerage community in many of our markets. We believe that in the brokerage community we have a reputation for knowing our business, having the capital to close deals, and making accurate and timely decisions that benefit both the buyer and seller. For these reasons, we believe that brokers routinely notify us when desirable tracts of land are available for purchase. 
 In our land acquisition process, projects of interest are evaluated at the division level using an extensive due diligence checklist which includes assessing the permitting and regulatory requirements, environmental considerations, local market conditions, and anticipated floor plans, pricing, and financial returns. We also acquire and develop land for use in our wholesale business.

 Homes in Inventory 
 When entering a new community, we intend to build a sufficient number of move-in ready homes to meet our budgets. We base future home starts on home closings. As homes are closed, we start more homes to maintain our inventory. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 1,985 completed homes, including information centers, and 1,323 homes in progress. 
 The following is a summary of our homes in inventory by reportable segment as of December 31, 2022 (dollar values in thousands):

 Raw Materials and Labor 
 When constructing homes, we use various materials and components. We generally contract for our materials and labor at a fixed price for the anticipated construction period of our homes. This allows us to mitigate the risks associated with increases in building materials and labor costs between the time construction begins on a home and the time it is closed. Typically, the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. We purchase some components and materials centrally to leverage our purchasing power to achieve volume discounts, a practice that often reduces costs and ensures timely deliveries. We typically do not store significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in progress materials for homes under construction. In addition, the majority of our raw materials are supplied to us by our subcontractors and are included in the price of our contract with such subcontractors. Most of the raw materials necessary for our subcontractors are standard items carried by major suppliers. Our construction work is substantially completed by third-party subcontractors, most of whom are non-unionized. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. Typically, the price changes that most significantly influence our operations are price increases in labor, commodities and lumber. In future quarters, we could see various cost pressures associated with widespread global inflation similar to the severity experienced during 2022. Generally, we have successfully increased the sales prices of our homes to absorb these increased costs or have successfully made cost-effective changes as we endeavor to keep our homes affordable.

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, significant supply chain disruptions have extended our land development and homebuilding construction cycles across the markets we serve. We are continuing to focus on our supply chain to limit the impact to both our business and customers. We believe these challenges will continue to impact our operations in 2023. 
 
 Seasonality 
 The homebuilding industry generally exhibits seasonality. We have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. See discussion included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Seasonality . 
 
 Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters, which impose zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes or mandate the type of structure that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or slow-growth or no-growth initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. 
 We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, health and safety. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site s location, whether the site contains wetlands or other features that may create burdensome permitting requirements, its environmental conditions, the present and former uses of the site, the presence or absence of endangered plants or species or sensitive habitats, and environmental conditions at adjoining or nearby properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers and homebuilders compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties, among other sanctions, for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in delays. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. 
 Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held strictly and/or jointly and severally liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including property damage or bodily injury, and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. A mitigation plan may be implemented during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or to address a naturally occurring condition, such as methane or radon. Some homebuyers may not want to purchase a home that is, or may have been, subject to a mitigation plan. To date, we have not incurred any material unanticipated liabilities relating to the removal or remediation of toxic wastes or other environmental conditions. 
 
 Competition 
 The U.S. homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete in each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We also compete with sales of existing homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage financing terms and location. There has been some consolidation among national homebuilders in the United States, and we expect that this trend may continue. 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 LGI Homes is committed to being a people-focused organization and actively promotes a workplace of dignity and respect for all. We strive to uphold all applicable laws and regulations in the markets where we conduct business and pursue business relationships with external partners who share our commitment to lawful, ethical business conduct. We believe our commitments to diversity and inclusion, training, safety and sustainability form the foundation of our people-focused culture.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Discussion of our business and operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to, many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control. Although the risks summarized below are organized by heading, and each risk is summarized separately, many of the risks are interrelated. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. 
 Risk Factors Summary 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to: 
 Operational Risks Related to Our Business: 
 labor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations that could delay or increase the cost of home construction; 
 our ability to acquire finished lots and land parcels suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices; 
 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 Industry and Economic Risks: 
 rising mortgage interest rates, and the tightening of mortgage lending standards and mortgage financing requirements; 
 the housing market may continue its recent decline or decline further; 
 the homebuilding industry is highly competitive; 
 new and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; 
 increasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters; 
 the seasonal nature of our business; 
 Strategic Risks Related to Our Business: 
 our growth or expansion strategies may not be successful; 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure: 
 we depend on key management personnel and other experienced employees; 
 our use of leverage in executing our business strategy; 
 we are a holding company, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to service our debt and pay dividends, if any, taxes and other expenses; 
 General Risks: 
 we may be subject to litigation, arbitration or other claims; 
 information system failures, cyber incidents or breaches in security; 
 complex and evolving U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection; and 
 access to financing sources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. 
 Operational Risks Related to Our Business 
 The long-term sustainability and growth in our home closings depends in part upon our ability to acquire finished lots and land parcels suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices. 
 The long-term sustainability of our operations as well as future growth depends in large part on the price at which we are able to obtain suitable finished lots and land parcels for development to support our homebuilding operation. Our ability to acquire finished lots and land parcels for new single-family homes and other projects may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning, regulations that limit housing density, the ability to obtain building permits, environmental requirements and other market conditions and regulatory requirements. If suitable lots or land at reasonable prices become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased substantially, which could adversely impact us. As competition for suitable land increases, the cost of undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could also rise and the availability of suitable land at 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact us. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of our land acquisition strategy, which may impact our ability to maintain or increase the number of our active communities, as well as to sustain and grow our revenues and margins, and achieve or maintain profitability. Additionally, developing undeveloped land is capital intensive and time consuming and we may develop land based upon forecasts and assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, resulting in projects that are not economically viable. 
 In recent years, it has become more difficult to acquire finished lots in attractive locations and therefore we have been acquiring more undeveloped land that we need to develop as compared to finished lots. This shift in our land procurement has resulted in longer lead time between when we acquire the land and when we can start construction of a home on the land and thus a longer time that these land assets are on our balance sheet. 
 Risks associated with our land and lot inventories could adversely affect our business or financial results. 
 Risks inherent in controlling, purchasing, holding and developing land for new home construction are substantial. The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land parcels increase as consumer demand for housing decreases and the holding period increases. As a result, we may buy and develop land parcels on which homes cannot be profitably built and sold. In certain circumstances, a grant of entitlements or development agreement with respect to a particular parcel of land may include restrictions on the transfer of such entitlements to a buyer of such land, which would negatively impact the price of such entitled land by restricting our ability to sell it for its full entitled value. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market. Developing land and constructing homes takes a considerable amount of time and requires a substantial cash investment. Land development is a key part of our operations and we develop land in most of our markets. The time and investment required for development may adversely impact our business. We have substantial real estate inventories that regularly remain on our balance sheet for significant periods of time prior to their sale, during which time we are exposed to the risk of adverse market developments. Our business model is based on building homes before a sales contract is executed and a customer deposit is received. Because interest and other expenses are capitalized only during the development of land and home construction, we incur interest subject to capitalization criteria and recognize maintenance expenses on unsold completed homes in inventory. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,985 completed homes in inventory and 1,323 homes in progress in inventory. In the event there is a continued downturn in home sales in our markets, our inventory of completed homes could increase, leading to additional financing costs and lower margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and operations. In the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes at significantly lower margins or at a loss, if we are able to sell them at all. Additionally, deteriorating market conditions could cause us to record significant inventory impairment charges. The recording of a significant inventory impairment could negatively affect our reported earnings per share and negatively impact the market perception of our business. 
 Labor and raw material shortages, price fluctuations and supply chain constraints could delay or increase the cost of home construction, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 The residential construction industry experiences labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified subcontractors and tradespeople and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing, during periods following natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures or as a result of broader economic disruptions, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, pricing for labor and raw materials can be affected by the factors discussed above and various other national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including changes in immigration laws, trends in labor migration and tariffs. For example, the federal government has previously imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes, including lumber, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them). Such government-imposed tariffs and trade regulations on imported building supplies, and retaliatory measures by other countries, may in the future have significant impacts on the cost to construct our homes and on our customers budgets, including by causing disruptions or shortages in our supply chain. We have also experienced labor shortages, price fluctuations and increased labor costs, including as a result of inflation or wage increases, particularly over the past year due to historic inflation rates in the United States. It is uncertain whether these conditions will continue as is, improve or worsen. Additionally, in 2021, we saw a significant increase in the cost of our lumber related to undersupply as a result of increased demand and shutdowns of lumber mills due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may see additional lumber cost pressures in the future. Further, our success in recently-entered markets or those we may choose to enter in the future depends substantially on our ability to source labor and local materials on terms that are favorable to us. Our markets may exhibit a reduced level of skilled labor relative to increased homebuilding demand in these markets. In the event of shortages in labor or raw materials in such markets, local subcontractors, tradespeople and suppliers may choose to allocate their resources to homebuilders with an established presence in the market and with whom they have longer-standing relationships. Labor and raw material shortages, price increases for labor and raw materials and supply chain constraints could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our business and results of operations are dependent on the availability, skill and performance of subcontractors. 
 We engage subcontractors to perform the construction of our homes and, in many cases, to select and obtain the raw materials used in constructing our homes. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depend on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. While we anticipate being able to obtain sufficient materials and reliable subcontractors and believe that our relationships with subcontractors are good, we do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and we can provide no assurance that skilled subcontractors will be available at reasonable rates and in our markets. In addition, as we expand into new markets, we typically must develop new relationships with subcontractors in such markets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a cost-effective and timely manner, or at all. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable rates on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Despite our quality control and jobsite safety efforts, we may discover from time to time that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction or safety practices or have installed defective materials in our homes. When we discover these issues, we utilize our subcontractors to repair the homes in accordance with our new home warranty and as required by law. The adverse costs of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the costs of warranty-related repairs from subcontractors, suppliers and insurers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We may also suffer reputational damage from the actions of subcontractors, which are beyond our control. 
 If we are unable to develop our communities successfully or within expected time-frames, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Before a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time we acquire control of an undeveloped property to the time we make our first home sale on the site. Delays in the development of communities, including delays associated with subcontractors performing the development activities or entitlements, labor and raw material shortages or supply chain disruptions, expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market one of our new undeveloped communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, higher than expected absorption rates in existing communities may result in lower than expected inventory levels until the development for replacement communities is completed. 
 We are subject to warranty and liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business that can be significant. 
 As a homebuilder and developer, we are subject to construction defect, product liability and home and other warranty claims, including moisture intrusion and related claims, arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common to the homebuilding industry and can be costly. There can be no assurance that any developments we undertake will be free from defects once completed and any defects attributable to us may lead to significant contractual or other liabilities. We rely on subcontractors to perform the construction of our homes and, in some cases, to select and obtain building materials. Although we provide subcontractors with detailed specifications and perform quality control procedures, subcontractors may, in some cases, use improper construction processes or defective materials. Defective products used in the construction of our homes can result in the need to perform extensive repairs. The cost of performing such repairs, or litigation arising out of such issues, may be significant if we are unable to recover the costs from subcontractors, suppliers and/or insurers. Warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity, including on social media outlets, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to sell homes. 
 We maintain, and require our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) and workers compensation insurance and generally seek to require our subcontractors to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work. While these insurance policies, subject to deductibles and other coverage limits, and indemnities protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our land development and homebuilding activities, we cannot provide assurance that these insurance policies and indemnities will be adequate to address all our home and other warranty, product liability and construction defect claims in the future, or that any potential inadequacies will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, the coverage offered by, and the availability of, general liability insurance for completed operations and construction defects are currently limited and costly. We cannot provide assurance that coverage will not be further restricted, increasing our risks and financial exposure to claims, and/or become costlier.

 We could be adversely affected by efforts to impose joint employer liability on us for labor law violations committed by our subcontractors. 
 Our homes are constructed by employees of subcontractors and other third parties. We do not have the ability to control what these parties pay their employees or the rules they impose on their employees. However, various governmental agencies have taken actions to hold parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other labor laws by subcontractors. Governmental rulings that hold us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us under our subcontractor relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects. 
 We are often required to provide bonds, letters of credit or guarantees to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. As a result of market conditions, some surety providers have been reluctant to issue new bonds and providers may require credit enhancements, such as cash deposits or letters of credit, in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds in the future for our projects, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds or in place of bonds, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Poor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline. 
 Residents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect our sales or our reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Any joint venture investments that we make could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of our joint venture partners and disputes between us and our joint venture partners. 
 We have established LGI Mortgage Solutions and LGI Insurance Solutions, two separate joint ventures with a long-time, third-party preferred lender and third-party insurance agency. We may co-invest in the future with third parties through other partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a land acquisition and/or a development. In this event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the acquisition and/or development, and our investment may be illiquid due to our lack of control. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions or block or delay necessary decisions. Our joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor our joint venture partners would have full control over the land acquisition or development. Disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners. 
 In addition, our LGI Mortgage Solutions joint venture involves additional risks associated with the mortgage banking business. The mortgage banking business is competitive, and competitors include mortgage lenders, such as national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than our joint venture does, and some of them may operate with different criteria than our joint venture does. These competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than our joint venture does. For these reasons, our joint venture may not be able to compete effectively in the mortgage banking business. Further, the mortgage banking business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, which, among other things: prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines; provide for audits and inspections; require appraisals and/or credit reports on prospective borrowers and disclosure of certain information concerning credit and settlement costs; establish maximum loan amounts; prohibit predatory lending practices; and regulate the referral of business to affiliated entities. The regulatory environment for mortgage lending is complex and ever changing and has led to an increase in the number of audits, examinations and investigations in the industry. The 2008 housing downturn resulted in numerous changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry. More recently, in response to COVID-19, federal agencies, state governments and private lenders are proactively providing relief to borrowers in the housing market by, subject to requirements, suspending home foreclosures and granting payment forbearance, among other 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 things. These relief measures are temporary, but these changes and others could become incorporated into the current regulatory framework. Any changes or new enactments could result in more stringent compliance standards, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market perception of our business. Additionally, if we are unable to originate mortgages for any reason going forward, our customers may experience significant mortgage loan funding issues, which could have a material impact on our homebuilding business and our consolidated financial statements. 
 Our business could be materially and adversely disrupted by an epidemic, pandemic (such as COVID-19) or similar public health threat. 
 An epidemic, pandemic or similar serious public health issue, and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period, and thereby, along with any associated economic and social instability or distress, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects. 
 For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in federal, state and local governments imposing varying degrees of restrictions on business and social activities to contain COVID-19, including business shutdowns and closures, travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and stay-at-home orders in certain of our markets. While many of the restrictions and measures initially implemented during 2020 have since been lifted in the United States, and the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines during 2021 helped to initiate a recovery from the pandemic, recent increases in COVID-19 cases, the uncertainty regarding new variants of COVID-19 and the success of any vaccines in respect thereof may in the future cause a significant reduction in economic activity or prompt the re-imposition of certain restrictions and measures. 
 To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section. There is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics or pandemics will not occur, or that the U.S. economy will fully recover therefrom, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Industry and Economic Risks 
 Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 Currently, the United States is experiencing inflationary conditions. Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results by increasing the costs of land, raw materials and labor needed to operate our business. Inflation may also accompany higher interest rates, which could adversely impact potential customers ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby decreasing demand for our homes. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we have experienced a significant increase in land, labor, materials and construction costs, which we currently expect to continue into 2023. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the homebuilding industry and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our homes enough to offset the increasing costs of our operations, which would decrease our profit margins. Furthermore, if we need to lower the sales prices of our homes to meet demand, the value of our land inventory may decrease. Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business. 
 Rising mortgage interest rates, tightening of mortgage lending standards and mortgage financing requirements, untimely or incomplete mortgage loan originations for our homebuyers and rising mortgage interest rates could adversely affect the availability of mortgage loans for potential purchasers of our homes and thereby materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Almost all of our customers finance their home purchases through lenders that provide mortgage financing. Mortgage interest rates have increased significantly during 2022, which has made the homes we sell less affordable. The current and continued macroeconomic conditions impacting the homebuilding industry are rapid inflation and rising interest rates. The significant burden of inflation and the rise of mortgage interest rates for our customers during 2022 are viewed by us as the primary driver behind the sudden decrease in demand for new homes beginning in March 2022. However, we cannot predict whether mortgage interest rates will continue to rise, remain high or fall. If mortgage interest rates continue to increase, the ability of prospective homebuyers to finance home purchases may be adversely affected, and, as a result, our operating results may be significantly negatively impacted. 
 Additionally, rapid increases in interest rates may negatively impact the affordability of a home purchase for existing buyers in backlog who still need to lock in a mortgage interest rate for their loan. This volatility could lead to an increase in cancellations of home purchase contracts. Our homebuilding activities depend upon the availability of mortgage financing to homebuyers, which is expected to be impacted by ongoing regulatory changes and fluctuations in the risk appetites of lenders. The financial documentation, down payment amounts and income-to-debt ratio requirements are subject to change and could become more restrictive.

 The federal government has a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ), both of which purchase or insure mortgage loans and mortgage loan-backed securities, and its insurance of mortgage loans through or in connection with the Federal Housing Administration FHA ), the Veterans Administration VA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA ). FHA and USDA backing of mortgage loans has been particularly important to the mortgage finance industry and to our business. If either the FHA or USDA raised their down payment requirements or lowered maximum loan amounts, our business could be materially affected. Increased lending volume and losses insured by the FHA have resulted in a reduction of the FHA insurance fund. The USDA rural development program provides for zero down payment and 100 financing for homebuyers in qualifying areas. If the USDA program was discontinued or if funding was decreased, then our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if the USDA changed its determination of areas that are eligible to qualify for the program, it could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in governmental regulation with respect to mortgage lenders could adversely affect demand for housing. 
 The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including mortgage interest rates for such loans, could also be adversely affected by a scaling back or termination of the federal government s mortgage loan-related programs or policies. Because Fannie Mae-, Freddie Mac-, FHA-, USDA- and VA-backed mortgage loans have been an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations or restrictions in the availability of, or higher consumer costs for, such government-backed financing could adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The elimination or curtailment of state bonds to assist homebuyers could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, certain current regulations impose, and future regulations may strengthen or impose new, standards and requirements relating to the origination, securitization and servicing of residential consumer mortgage loans, which could further restrict the availability and affordability of mortgage loans and the demand for such loans by financial intermediaries and, as a result, adversely affect our home sales, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if, due to credit or consumer lending market conditions, reduced liquidity, increased risk retention or minimum capital level obligations and/or regulatory restrictions related to certain regulations, laws or other factors or business decisions, these lenders refuse or are unable to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers, or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain such loans, the number of homes we close and our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 First-time homebuyers are generally more affected by the availability of mortgage financing than other potential homebuyers. These homebuyers are a key source of demand for our new homes. A limited availability of suitable mortgage financing may adversely affect the volume and sales price of our home sales. 
 Increases in cancellations of purchase contracts could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Our backlog reflects standard purchase contracts with our homebuyers for homes that still need to be delivered. We require a deposit from our homebuyers for all homes reflected in our backlog, and generally, we have the right to retain the deposit if the homebuyer does not complete the purchase. In some cases, however, a homebuyer may cancel the purchase contract and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit for reasons such as state and local law requirements, the homebuyer s inability to obtain mortgage financing, the homebuyer s failure to sell their current home, or our inability to complete and deliver the house within the defined time. Homebuyers may also choose to cancel their purchase contract and forfeit their deposit. As of December 31, 2022, we had 702 homes with an ending backlog value of 252.0 million. With the weakening of the housing market, we have experienced an increase in cancellation rates. If economic conditions decline further, if mortgage financing becomes less available, or if our homes become less attractive due to market price declines or due to other conditions at or in the vicinity of our communities, we could experience an additional increase in homebuyers canceling their purchase contracts with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Any limitation on, or reduction or elimination of, tax benefits associated with homeownership would have an adverse effect upon the demand for homes, which could be material to our business. 
 While tax laws generally permit significant expenses associated with homeownership, primarily mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, to be deducted for the purpose of calculating an individual s federal and, in many cases, state taxable income, the ability to deduct mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes for federal income tax purposes is limited. The federal government or a state government may change its income tax laws by eliminating, limiting or substantially reducing these income tax benefits without offsetting provisions, which may increase the after-tax cost of owning a new home for many of our potential homebuyers. Any such future changes may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general. For example, the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions could decrease the demand for new homes. Any such future changes could also have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

 The housing market may continue its recent decline or decline further, and any such continuation or decline in our markets or for the homebuilding industry generally may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 We cannot predict whether and to what extent the housing markets in the geographic areas in which we operate will grow, particularly if interest rates for mortgage loans, land costs, and construction costs continue to rise. The U.S. housing market remained strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but began softening during the second quarter of 2022 and continued to decline through the remainder of 2022 primarily due to inflationary pricing, rapidly rising interest rates for mortgage loans, and construction costs. Other factors that might impact the homebuilding industry include uncertainty in domestic and international financial, credit and consumer lending markets amid slow economic growth or recessionary conditions in various regions or industries around the world, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, tight lending standards and practices for mortgage loans that limit consumers ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home, including increased minimum credit score requirements, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees and required down payment amounts, higher home prices, more conservative appraisals, changing consumer preferences, higher loan-to-value ratios and extensive buyer income and asset documentation requirements, changes to mortgage regulations, slower rates of population growth or population decline in our markets, or Federal Reserve policy changes. 
 If there is limited economic growth, declines in employment and consumer income, changes in consumer behavior, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and/or tightening of mortgage lending standards, practices and regulation in the geographic areas in which we operate, or if interest rates for mortgage loans or home prices continue to rise, there could likely be a corresponding adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to, the number of homes we sell, our average sales price per home closed , cancellations of home purchase contracts and the amount of revenues or profits we generate, and such effect may be material. 
 The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, if our competitors are more successful or offer better value to our customers, our business could decline. 
 We operate in a very competitive environment that is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders and land developers in each market in which we operate. Additionally, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We compete with large national and regional homebuilding companies, some of which have greater financial and operational resources than us, and with smaller local homebuilders and land developers, some of which may have lower administrative costs than us. We may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain of our large national and regional homebuilding competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturns in the housing market. Furthermore, our market share in certain of our markets may be lower as compared to some of our competitors. Many of our competitors also have longer operating histories and longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or to which we may expand. This may give our competitors an advantage in marketing their products, securing materials and labor at lower prices and allowing their homes to be delivered to customers more quickly and at more favorable prices. We compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct homes that are substantially similar to our products. 
 Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion and cause us to increase our selling incentives and reduce our prices. An oversupply of homes available for sale or discounting of home prices could periodically adversely affect demand for our homes in certain markets and could adversely affect pricing for homes in the markets in which we operate. 
 If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in any of our markets. Our inability to continue to compete successfully in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Regional factors affecting the homebuilding industry in our current markets could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition of suitable land and the design, construction and sale of primarily single-family homes in residential subdivisions, including planned communities, in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Alabama, California, Oregon, Nevada, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland. In addition, we own land or have entered into contracts for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time in additional states. A prolonged economic downturn in the future in one or more of these areas, or a particular industry that is fundamental to one or more of these areas, particularly within Texas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our communities on the West coast are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. To the extent the oil and gas industry, which can be very volatile, is negatively impacted by declining commodity prices, climate change, legislation or other factors, a result could be a reduction in employment or other negative economic consequences, which in turn could adversely impact our home sales and activities in certain of our markets. 
 Moreover, certain insurance companies doing business in states in which we operate could restrict, curtail or suspend the issuance of homeowners insurance policies on single-family homes. This could both reduce the availability of hurricane and other types of natural disaster insurance, in general, and increase the cost of such insurance to prospective purchasers of homes. Mortgage financing for a new home is conditioned, among other things, on the availability of adequate homeowners insurance. There can be no assurance that homeowners insurance will be available or affordable to prospective purchasers of our homes. Long-term restrictions on, or unavailability of, homeowners insurance could have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in our markets and on our business. Additionally, the availability of permits for new homes in new and existing developments could be adversely affected by the significantly limited capacity of the schools, roads, and other infrastructure. 
 If adverse conditions in these markets develop in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if buyer demand for new homes in these markets decreases, home prices could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Fluctuations in real estate values may require us to write-down the book value of our real estate assets. 
 The homebuilding and land development industries are subject to significant variability and fluctuations in real estate values. As a result, we may be required to write-down the book value of our real estate assets in accordance with GAAP, and some of those write-downs could be material. Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If the market value of our land inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs. 
 The market value of our land and housing inventories depends on market conditions. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets. There is an inherent risk that the value of the land owned by us may decline after purchase. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. In addition, our deposits for lots controlled under purchase, option or similar contracts may be put at risk. 
 Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations are subject to uncertainty. Moreover, our valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. 
 If housing demand fails to meet our expectations when we acquired our inventory, our profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we build and sell houses. We regularly review the value of our land holdings and continue to review our holdings on a periodic basis. Material write-downs and impairments in the value of our inventory may be required, and we may in the future sell land or homes at a loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Interest rate changes may adversely affect us. 
 Increases in interest rates can make it more difficult and/or expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business. Increases in interest rates generally could increase the interest rates we must pay on borrowings under the Credit Agreement and on any subsequent issuances of debt securities. Adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable. We could be required to liquidate one or more of our assets at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our assets in order to meet our debt service obligations.

 Difficulties with appraisal valuations in relation to the proposed sales price of our homes could force us to reduce the price of our homes for sale. 
 Each of our home sales may require an appraisal of the home value before closing. These appraisals are professional judgments of the market value of the property and are based on a variety of market factors. If our internal valuations of the market and pricing do not line up with the appraisal valuations and appraisals are not at or near the agreed upon sales price, we may be forced to reduce the sales price of the home to complete the sale. These appraisal issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Any future government shutdowns or slowdowns may materially adversely affect our business or financial results. 
 Any future government shutdowns or slowdowns may materially adversely affect our business or financial results. We can make no assurances that potential home closings affected by any such shutdown or slowdown will occur after the shutdown or slowdown has ended. 
 Natural disasters, severe weather and adverse geological conditions may increase costs, cause project delays and reduce consumer demand for housing, all of which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our homebuilding operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, severe weather or adverse geological conditions. These include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, storm surge, coastal erosion, sea level rise, brushfires, wildfires, prolonged periods of precipitation, landslides, soil subsidence, earthquakes and other natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our land parcels and projects, cause delays in completion of our projects, reduce consumer demand for housing, increase mortgage default risk, and cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, any of which could affect our sales and profitability. In addition to directly damaging our land or projects, many of these natural events could damage roads and highways providing access to our assets or affect the desirability of our land or projects, thereby adversely affecting our ability to market homes or sell land in those areas and possibly increasing the costs of homebuilding completion. Furthermore, the occurrence of natural disasters, severe weather and other adverse geological conditions has increased in recent years due to climate change and may continue to increase in the future. Climate change may have the effect of making the risks described above occur more frequently and more severely, which could amplify the adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 There are some risks of loss for which we may be unable to purchase insurance coverage. For example, losses associated with hurricanes, landslides, prolonged periods of precipitation, earthquakes and other weather-related and geologic events may not be insurable and other losses, such as those arising from terrorism, may not be economically insurable. A sizeable uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 New and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build or delay completion of our projects. 
 We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, accessibility, anti-discrimination and other matters, which, among other things, impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. We may encounter issues with entitlement, not identify all entitlement requirements during the pre-development review of a project site, or encounter zoning changes that impact our operations. Projects for which we have not received land use and development entitlements or approvals may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or zoning changes. Such moratoriums generally relate to insufficient water supplies, sewage facilities, delays in utility hook-ups, or inadequate road capacity within specific market areas or subdivisions. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result of any of these statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations, the timing of our home sales could be delayed, the number of our home sales could decline and/or our costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, result in liabilities, limit the areas in which we can build homes and delay completion of our projects. 
 We are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants and human health and safety. The particular environmental requirements that apply to any given site vary according to multiple factors, including the site s location, whether the site contains wetlands or other features that may create burdensome permitting requirements, its environmental conditions, the 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 present and former uses of the site, the presence or absence of endangered plants or animals or sensitive habitats, and environmental conditions at adjoining or nearby properties. We may not identify all of these concerns during any pre-acquisition or pre-development review of project sites. Environmental requirements and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or in areas contaminated by others before we commence development. In some instances, regulators from different governmental agencies do not concur on development, remedial standards or property use restrictions for a project, and the resulting delays or additional costs can be material for a given project. 
 From time to time, the EPA and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers and homebuilders compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties, among other sanctions, for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws, including those applicable to control storm water discharges during construction, or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. We cannot assure you that environmental, health and safety laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and energy can have an adverse impact on our activities, operations and profitability and on the availability and price of certain raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete. 
 There is a growing concern from advocacy groups and the general public that the emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities have caused, and will continue to cause, significant changes in weather patterns and temperatures and the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Government mandates, standards and regulations enacted in response to these projected climate change impacts and concerns could result in restrictions on land development in certain areas or increased energy, transportation and raw material costs. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an instrument that will lead to the United States reentry into the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years. We anticipate that a variety of new legislation may be enacted or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local levels relating to climate change and energy, including in response to the United States reentry into the Paris Agreement. This legislation could relate to, for example, matters such as greenhouse gas emissions control and building and other codes that impose energy efficiency standards or require energy saving construction materials. On June 1, 2022, the Biden Administration launched the National Initiative to Advance Building Codes, an initiative to modernize building codes, improve climate resilience, and reduce energy costs and the recent Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, through various grants and tax incentives, encourages municipalities to adopt stricter energy codes, both of which could increase the cost to construct homes and cause delays. 
 Certain state and local governments in areas such as California have passed, or are considering, legislation banning the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, which could affect our costs to construct homes as well as consumer demand for the homes we construct. New building or other code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards or requirements for building materials could significantly increase our cost to construct homes. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation, regulations, mandates, standards and other requirements of this nature are expected to continue to be enacted and become costlier for us to comply with. Similarly, energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade or similar energy-related regulations. 
 Ownership, leasing or occupation of land and the use of hazardous materials carries potential environmental risks and liabilities. 
 We are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, rules and regulations concerning easements, land use and the protection of health and the environment, including those governing discharge of pollutants to soil, water and air, the handling of hazardous materials such as asbestos, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of man-made or natural hazardous or toxic substances located on, under or in a property currently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by us, whether or not we caused or knew of the pollution. 
 The particular impact and requirements of environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the site, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. We expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. Environmental laws may result in delays, cause us to implement time consuming and expensive compliance programs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas, such as wetlands. Concerns could arise due to post-acquisition changes in laws or agency policies, or the interpretation thereof.

 Furthermore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other sanctions and damages from third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of our failure to comply with, or liabilities under, applicable environmental laws and regulations. These matters could adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 As a homebuilding and land development business with a wide variety of historic ownership, development, homebuilding and construction activities, we could be liable for future claims for damages as a result of the past or present use of hazardous materials, including building materials or fixtures known or suspected to be hazardous or to contain hazardous materials or due to use of building materials or fixtures that are associated with mold. Any such claims may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for such claims may be limited or nonexistent. 
 We have provided unsecured environmental indemnities to certain lenders and other contractual counterparties. These indemnities obligate us to reimburse the guaranteed parties for damages related to environmental matters, and generally there is no term or damage limitation on these indemnities. 
 Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price. 
 In recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to environmental, social and governance ESG matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change and promoting the use of energy saving building materials. A failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could also cause reputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. These ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. 
 Changes in tax law could adversely affect our business. 
 U.S. tax law is always subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect). For example, in August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contains significant changes to U.S. tax law including, but not limited to, a corporate minimum tax and 1 excise tax on stock repurchases. Other potential changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code ), include changes to the U.S. corporate income tax rate and provisions limiting or eliminating various deductions, credits or tax preferences. Interpretations of the Code and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service are likewise subject to change. As states elect to conform (or else have rolling conformity) to the Code, such interpretations and regulations (including those promulgated by state authorities) could likewise affect our state income and franchise tax obligations. Any future changes in tax law, including changes to U.S. federal, state, territorial or local tax law, could affect our tax position and adversely impact our business. 
 Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate. 
 As discussed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Seasonality , we have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. We generally close more homes in our second, third and fourth quarters. Thus, our revenues may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we may have higher capital requirements in our second, third and fourth quarters in order to maintain our inventory levels. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will invest significant amounts of capital in the acquisition and development of land and construction of homes that we do not sell at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames. If, due to market conditions, construction delays or other causes, we do not complete home sales at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long term, but we can make no assurances as to the degree to which our historical seasonal patterns will occur in the future.

 Our industry is cyclical and adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for homes and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our business can be substantially affected by adverse changes in general economic or business conditions that are outside of our control, including changes in short-term and long-term interest rates; employment levels and job and personal income growth; housing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes, among other factors; availability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers; housing affordability; consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular; consumer spending; financial system and credit market stability; private party and government mortgage loan programs (including changes in FHA, USDA, VA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming mortgage loan limits, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees, down payment requirements and underwriting standards), and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices; federal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses; supply of and prices for available new or resale homes (including lender-owned homes) and other housing alternatives, such as apartments, single-family rentals and other rental housing; homebuyer interest in our current or new product designs and new home community locations; general consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to choosing other housing alternatives; interest of financial institutions or other businesses in purchasing wholesale homes; and real estate taxes. Adverse changes in these conditions may affect our business nationally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular submarkets in which we operate. Inclement weather, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, prolonged periods of precipitation, droughts and fires), other calamities and other environmental conditions can delay the delivery of our homes and/or increase our costs. Civil unrest or acts of terrorism can also have a negative effect on our business. If the homebuilding industry experiences another significant or sustained downturn, it would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in future years. 
 In the second half of 2022, the Federal Reserve s aggressive actions to stem inflation caused mortgage interest rates to more than double between the end of 2021 and September 2022. The resulting increased costs of borrowing negatively impacted customer sentiment and accelerated existing affordability constraints for potential homebuyers. As a result, many homebuyers paused their home purchasing decisions. Additionally, challenges from ongoing supply chain disruptions and higher construction and development costs persisted during 2022. We anticipate this dynamic could continue in 2023, resulting in lower net orders and higher cancellation rates when compared to prior periods. 
 The potential difficulties described above can cause demand and prices for our homes to fall or cause us to take longer and incur more costs to develop the land and build our homes. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because of market conditions. The potential difficulties described above could also lead some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether. 
 A major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage. 
 Building sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding and land development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. 
 Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies, governmental authorities and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could result in an inability to acquire land for our developments or increased costs and delays in the completion of development projects, increase home construction costs or delay home construction entirely. 
 The homebuilding and land development industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land parcels and begin development. In addition, if housing markets are not favorable or permitting or development takes longer than anticipated, we may be required to hold our investments in land for extended periods of time. If internally generated funds are not sufficient, we may seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financings and/or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be constrained regionally or nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. Since the global recession in 2008, credit and capital markets have, from time to time, experienced unusual volatility. If we are required to seek additional financing to fund our operations, continued volatility in 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 these markets may restrict our flexibility to access such financing. Furthermore, any downgrade of our credit ratings or other negative rating actions by credit agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to access capital. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient funding for our planned capital and other expenditures or if we do not properly allocate our funding, we may be unable to acquire additional land for development and/or to construct new housing. Additionally, if we cannot obtain additional financing to fund the purchase of land under our purchase contracts, we may incur contractual penalties, fees and increased expenses from the write-off of due diligence and pre-acquisition costs. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays and any such delay could result in cost increases. Any one or more of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Strategic Risks Related to Our Business 
 We cannot make any assurances that our growth or expansion strategies will be successful or not expose us to additional risks. 
 We have expanded our business through selected investments in new geographic markets and by diversifying our products in certain markets. Investments in land, finished lots, home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies. 
 We may develop communities in which we build townhomes or other multi-family homes in addition to single-family homes, sell acreage home sites as a part of the development, sell homes to investors or portfolio management companies, or develop commercial properties that may be complementary to our communities. We might acquire another homebuilder or developer in order to accomplish our growth or expansion strategies. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify, acquire or implement these new strategies in the future. Accordingly, any such expansion, including through acquisitions, could expose us to significant risks, beyond those associated with operating our existing business, including understanding and complying with the laws and regulations of new jurisdictions, diversion of our management s attention from ongoing business concerns, difficulties in integrating an acquired business, and incurrence of unanticipated liabilities and expenses and may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may incur a variety of costs to engage in future growth or expansion of our operations, including through add-on acquisitions, and the anticipated benefits may never be realized. 
 We intend to grow our operations in existing markets, and we may expand into new markets or pursue opportunistic purchases of other homebuilders on attractive terms as, and if, such opportunities arise. We may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of any such growth or expansion, including through add-on acquisitions or through efficiencies that we may be unable to achieve, the anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected or we may incur greater costs than expected in attempting to achieve the anticipated benefits. In such cases, we will likely need to employ additional personnel or consultants that are knowledgeable of such markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to employ or retain the necessary personnel to successfully implement a disciplined management process and culture with local management, that our expansion operations will be successful, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired homebuilder. This could disrupt our ongoing operations and divert management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. Accordingly, any such expansion could expose us to significant risks beyond those associated with operating our existing business and may adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 We depend on key management personnel and other experienced employees. 
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key management personnel, including, but not limited to, Eric Lipar, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lipar, there is no guarantee that Mr. Lipar will remain employed by us. Our ability to retain our key management personnel or to attract suitable replacements should any members of our management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key management personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key management personnel. 
 Experienced employees in the homebuilding, land acquisition, development, and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain and manage opportunities. In particular, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive land acquisition opportunities. Experienced employees working in the homebuilding, development 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 and construction industries are highly sought after. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Termination of the employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer could be costly and prevent a change in control of our company. 
 The employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Lipar, provides that if his employment with us terminates under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay him a significant amount of severance compensation, thereby making it costly to terminate his employment. Furthermore, these provisions could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium paid for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 We expect to use leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect the return on our assets. 
 We expect to employ prudent levels of leverage to finance the acquisition and development of our lots and construction of our homes. Our existing indebtedness is recourse to us, and we anticipate that future indebtedness will likewise be recourse. As of December 31, 2022, we had a 1.1 billion revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (as defined herein) to finance our construction and development activities. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of 828.4 million under the Credit Agreement and we could borrow an additional 236.6 million under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 1.85 per annum. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes (as defined herein). 
 The Board will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, if any, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. As a means of sustaining our long-term financial health and limiting our exposure to unforeseen dislocations in the debt and financing markets, we currently expect to remain conservatively capitalized. However, our certificate of incorporation does not contain a limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur, and the Board may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders. 
 Incurring substantial indebtedness could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would adversely affect us, including the risk that: 
 our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt, which is likely to result in acceleration of such indebtedness; 
 our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that our profitability will increase with higher financing cost; 
 we may be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future investment opportunities or other purposes; and 
 the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the indebtedness being refinanced. 
 If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our indebtedness at maturity, it may be necessary to refinance the indebtedness through additional debt or additional equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancings, increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses. To the extent we cannot meet any future debt service obligations, we will risk losing some or all of our assets that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure. Unsecured debt agreements may contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other indebtedness in some circumstances. Defaults under the Credit Agreement and our other debt agreements, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, restrictive provisions, performance obligations and penalties. 
 Our current financing agreements contain, and the financing arrangements we enter into in the future likely will contain, provisions that limit our ability to do certain things. In particular, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (i) a tangible net worth of not less than 850.0 million plus 75 of the net proceeds of all equity issuances after December 31, 2020 plus 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 50.0 of the amount of our positive net income in each fiscal quarter ending after March 31, 2021, (ii) a leverage ratio of not greater than 60.0 , (iii) liquidity of at least 50.0 million and (iv) a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recent four quarters of at least 1.75 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit the amount of our additional debt and our ability to make certain investments. 
 If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these provisions, we would be in default under the Credit Agreement and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. A default also could limit significantly our financing alternatives, which could cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or dispose of assets when we otherwise would not choose to do so. In addition, future indebtedness may contain financial covenants limiting our ability to, for example, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, reduce liquidity below certain levels and pay dividends to our stockholders, and otherwise affect our operating policies. If we default on one or more of our debt agreements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into several land banking financing arrangements with a third-party land banker to repurchase land that we sold to the land banker as a method of acquiring finished lots in staged takedowns. While we are not legally obligated to purchase the balance of the lots, we will be subject to certain performance obligations, financial and other penalties if the lots are not purchased. We do not have any ownership interest or title to the assets that we have sold to the land banker and we do not guarantee any of the land banker s liabilities. 
 Interest expense on debt we incur may limit our cash available to fund our growth strategies. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total outstanding borrowings of 828.4 million under the Credit Agreement, and we could borrow an additional 236.6 million under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.85 per annum. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.000 . If our operations do not generate sufficient cash from operations at levels currently anticipated, we may seek additional capital in the form of debt financing. Our current indebtedness includes, and any additional indebtedness we subsequently incur may have, a floating rate of interest. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current floating rate indebtedness and on any floating rate indebtedness we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes. If we need to repay existing indebtedness during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to refinance our then-existing indebtedness on unfavorable terms or liquidate one or more of our assets to repay such indebtedness at times which may not permit realization of the maximum return on such assets and could result in a loss. The occurrence of either such event or both could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. 
 We are a holding company, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to service our debt and pay dividends, if any, taxes and other expenses. 
 We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests or limited partnership interests in our subsidiaries. We have no independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause our subsidiaries to make distributions to their members in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by us. Our ability to service our debt depends on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans or other distributions, to pay amounts due on our obligations. Future financing arrangements may contain negative covenants that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to declare or pay dividends or make distributions. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities; to the extent that we need funds, and our subsidiaries are restricted from declaring or paying such dividends or making such distributions under applicable law or regulations, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds (for example, due to restrictions in future financing arrangements that limit the ability of our operating subsidiaries to distribute funds), our liquidity and financial condition could be materially harmed. 
 If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We may change our operational policies, investment guidelines and our business and growth strategies without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future. 
 The Board will determine our operational policies, investment guidelines and our business and growth strategies. The Board may make changes to, or approve transactions that deviate from, those policies, guidelines and strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those contemplated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We participate in certain unconsolidated entities where we may be adversely impacted by the failure of the limited partnership or joint venture or its participants to fulfill their obligations. 
 We currently participate through a real estate investment fund as a limited partner and operate through a mortgage service joint venture with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have contributed a total of 11.2 million and 5.6 million, respectively, relating to our investment in the real estate investment fund and the mortgage joint venture. Contributions into these unconsolidated entities are used by the entities to invest in certain real estate transactions and residential mortgage services, respectively. 
 As a result of not having a controlling interest in these entities, we have limited influence over decisions made with regard to these entities and are not able to require these entities or their participants to honor their obligations. If these entities or their participants do not honor their obligations, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses of our investments in these entities. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Failure to comply with laws and regulations may adversely affect us. 
 We are required to comply with laws and regulations governing many aspects of our business, such as land acquisition and development, home construction and sales, and employment practices. Despite our oversight, contractual protections, and other mitigation efforts, our employees or subcontractors could violate some of these laws or regulations, as a result of which we may incur fines, penalties or other liabilities, which could be significant, and our reputation with governmental agencies, customers, vendors or suppliers could be damaged. 
 We are subject to litigation, arbitration or other claims, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We are subject to litigation and we may in the future be subject to enforcement actions, such as claims relating to our operations, securities offerings and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. Although we have established warranty, claim and litigation reserves that we believe are adequate, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future, and legal proceedings may result in the award of substantial damages against us beyond our reserves. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured or in excess of insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Furthermore, plaintiffs may in certain of these legal proceedings seek class action status with potential class sizes that vary from case to case. Class action lawsuits can be costly to defend, and if we were to lose any certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability for us. Certain litigation or the resolution thereof may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers. 
 We may suffer uninsured losses or material losses in excess of insurance limits. 
 We could suffer physical damage to property and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance. Insurance against certain types of risks, such as terrorism, earthquakes, floods or personal injury claims, may be unavailable, available in amounts that are less than the full market value or replacement cost of investment or underlying assets or subject to a large deductible or self-insurance retention amount. In addition, there can be no assurance that certain types of risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economically feasible basis. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles or self-insurance retention, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future income from that property. Furthermore, we could be 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles. We may also be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. 
 Information system failures, cyber incidents or breaches in security could adversely affect us. 
 We rely on accounting, financial, operational, management and other information systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to conduct our operations, store personal data and sensitive data, process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and comply with financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our information systems, and those of our vendors and service providers, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches, including malware and phishing, cyberattacks, such as denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, natural disasters, usage errors by employees and other related risks. Any cyber incident or attack or breach or other disruption or failure in these information systems, or other systems or infrastructure upon which they rely, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any failure or security breach of information systems or data could result in a violation of applicable privacy, data security, or other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We have been the target of a number of unsuccessful cyberattacks and we expect these attacks to continue into the foreseeable future. We have employed administrative, physical and technical controls and processes to mitigate these types of risks and help protect our information systems, including appointing dedicated personnel responsible for overseeing the Company s information security posture, maintaining a suite of information security policies, providing routine employee cyber and information security training, and conducting third-party assessments. In addition, our technical safeguards are designed to provide multiple, redundant safeguards to protect against exploitation of a vulnerability that may arise or if a security control fails. Although we have implemented these safeguards, systems and processes intended to secure our information systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems will be effective or that future attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. 
 Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security. 
 As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information, including information specific to homebuyers, customers, employees, vendors and suppliers. We may share some of this information with third parties who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Personal privacy and data security have become significant issues and the subject of rapidly evolving regulation in the United States. Furthermore, federal, state and local government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, more laws and regulations affecting data privacy. Laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including California, Colorado, Utah and Virginia, legislation and implementing regulation, may significantly impact our business activities and require substantial compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adequately address privacy and data security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations and policies could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards relating to privacy or data security, our business may be materially harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of cyber incidents or attacks, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy and data security laws. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result. 
 Acts of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business. 
 Acts of war, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or civil unrest may cause disruption to the U.S. economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, result in building code changes that could increase costs of construction, result in uninsured losses, affect job growth and consumer confidence, or cause economic changes that we cannot anticipate, all of which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 While we do not have any customer or direct supplier relationships in either Russia or Ukraine, the current military conflict, and related sanctions, as well as export controls or actions that may be initiated by nations e.g. , potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) and other potential uncertainties could adversely affect our supply chain by causing shortages or increases in costs for materials necessary to construct homes and/or increases to the price of gasoline and other fuels. In 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 addition, such events could cause higher interest rates, inflation or general economic uncertainty, which could negatively impact our business partners, employees or customers, or otherwise adversely impact our business. 
 Negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation as well as our business, financial results and stock price. 
 Our reputation and brand are critical to our success. Unfavorable media related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. The speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites, blogs, newsletters, and other digital platforms. Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlet could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which would adversely affect our business. 
 Changes in accounting rules, assumptions and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Accounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our financial reporting are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgment. These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions and/or judgments, such as those related to asset impairments, could significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Access to financing sources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, especially in light of current market conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to maximize our returns. 
 Our access to additional third-party sources of financing will depend, in part, on: 
 general market conditions; 
 the duration and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 the market s perception of our growth potential; 
 with respect to acquisition and/or development financing, the market s perception of the value of the land parcels to be acquired and/or developed; 
 our current debt levels; 
 our current and expected future earnings; 
 our cash flow; and 
 the market price per share of our common stock. 
 The global credit and equity markets and the overall economy can be extremely volatile, which could have a number of adverse effects on our operations and capital requirements. For the past decade, the domestic financial markets have experienced a high degree of volatility, uncertainty and, during certain periods, tightening of liquidity in both the high yield debt and equity capital markets, resulting in certain periods where new capital has been both more difficult and more expensive to access. If we are unable to access the credit markets, we could be required to defer or eliminate important business strategies and growth opportunities in the future. In addition, if there is prolonged volatility and weakness in the capital and credit markets, potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may increase collateral requirements or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing. Consequently, our ability to access the credit market in order to attract financing on reasonable terms may be adversely affected. Investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure additional financing on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Depending on market conditions at the relevant time, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity financings or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities and other purposes. We may not have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all.

 Current Homebuilding and Inflationary Environment 
 For the first half of 2022, we saw robust demand for our homes and continued to benefit from pricing power that allowed us to pass through rising input costs related to supply chain constraints. In the second half of 2022, the Federal Reserve s aggressive actions to stem inflation caused mortgage interest rates to more than double between the end of 2021 and September 2022. The resulting increased costs of borrowing negatively impacted customer sentiment and accelerated existing affordability constraints for potential homebuyers. As a result, many homebuyers paused their home purchasing decisions. Additionally, challenges from ongoing supply chain disruptions and higher construction and development costs persisted during 2022. We anticipate this dynamic could continue in 2023, resulting in lower net orders and higher cancellation rates when compared to prior periods. Longer lead times relating to materials, municipality and labor activities increased our construction and development cycle times and slowed the timing of home closings. Our average home completion time was approximately 90 to 165 days in 2022 as compared to 90 to 130 days in 2021. 
 To address the demand headwinds and drive sales, we increased advertising spending to connect with more potential homebuyers, we began offering mortgage buy-down programs and other sales incentives to offset some of the affordability pressures and we increased our allocation of inventory available for sale to our wholesale channel. In addition, we evaluated our land position and significantly reduced our owned and controlled lots. 
 The decline in home closings for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to our strong prior year comparable numbers, combined with lower average community count and slower absorptions resulting from the impact of higher mortgage rates experienced during the second half of the year. 
 We expect that many of these challenges will persist in 2023 and could potentially worsen. However, we believe the long-term outlook for new homes remains strong, driven by solid fundamentals, including a historically low inventory of new and existing homes for sale, an aging housing stock, rising rents, strong household formations and low unemployment. We believe we are well positioned to meet the demands of this uncertain period based on our 100 spec-focused business model, targeted at the entry level buyers.

 Continuing Impact of COVID-19 
 We continue to see pressure on global supply chains due to disruptions created by the effects of COVID-19 and variants thereof (collectively, COVID-19 ), that extended construction and development cycles and delayed home closings and the opening of new communities. We continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs as we supply homes critical to maintaining essential infrastructure within the markets we serve. 
 Demand for our homes is dependent on a variety of macroeconomic factors, such as employment levels, mortgage rates, inflation, financial market stability, consumer confidence, housing demand, availability of financing for homebuyers, availability and prices of new homes compared to existing inventory, and demographic trends. These factors, and in particular consumer confidence, can be significantly adversely affected by a variety of factors beyond our control.

 Results of Operations 
 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (dollars in thousands, except per share data and average home sales price) Statement of Income Data: Home sales revenues 2,304,455 3,050,149 2,367,929 Expenses: Cost of sales 1,657,855 2,232,115 1,764,832 Selling expenses 144,928 170,005 148,366 General and administrative 111,565 100,331 90,021 Operating income 390,107 547,698 364,710 Loss on extinguishment of debt 13,976 Other income, net (28,009) (9,053) (3,139) Net income before income taxes 418,116 542,775 367,849 Income tax provision 91,549 113,130 43,954 Net income 326,567 429,645 323,895 Basic earnings per share 13.90 17.46 12.89 Diluted earnings per share 13.76 17.25 12.76 Other Financial and Operating Data: Average community count 91.9 104.4 111.9 Community count at end of period 99 101 116 Home closings 6,621 10,442 9,339 Average sales price per home closed 348,052 292,104 253,553 Gross margin (1)

 (1) Gross margin is home sales revenues less cost of sales. 
 (2) Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues. 
 (3) Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. Please see Non-GAAP Measures for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable. 
 (4) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental measures in evaluating operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vi) other income, net and (vii) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting. Our management believes that the presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization and items considered to be unusual or non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that these measures are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define these measures differently and, as a result, our measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the measures of other companies. Although we use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, the use of these measures is limited because they do not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures for reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable.

 Home Sales Revenues . Home sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 2.3 billion, a decrease of 0.7 billion, or 24.4 , from 3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in home sales revenues is primarily due to a 36.6 decrease in homes closed in fewer communities, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We closed 6,621 homes during 2022, as compared to 10,442 homes closed during 2021. The overall decrease in home closings is a result of lower average community count and overall lower absorption pace during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our average community count at December 31, 2022 decreased to 91.9 from 104.4 at December 31, 2021. The overall decrease in average community count relates to timing associated with the opening, close out or transition between certain active communities and longer development cycle times during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 348,052, an increase of 55,948, or 19.2 , from the average sales price per home closed of 292,104 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the average sales price per home closed in all reportable segments is primarily due to favorable pricing environments that allowed us to pass through cost increases associated with the construction of our homes. The overall decrease in absorption relates to the slowdown of demand primarily resulting from increased mortgage rates and longer cycle times stemming from pandemic-related production disruptions. These disruptions have caused varying degrees of supply chain constraints in the markets we serve. 
 Included within our home sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 340.6 million in wholesale revenues related to 1,233 home closings through our wholesale channel, representing 18.6 of the 6,621 total homes closed during the year ended December 31, 2022. Included within our home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 349.3 million in wholesale revenues related to 1,515 home closings through our wholesale channel, representing 14.5 of the 10,442 total homes closed during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in home closings as a percentage of revenues through our wholesale channel was related to the slowdown in retail sales experienced during the second half of 2022 and our

 decision to allocate more inventory available for sale to our wholesale partners during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Home sales revenues in our Central reportable segment decreased by 240.9 million, or 19.2 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 33.7 decrease in the number of homes closed driven by a decrease in the average community count at a lower absorption rate, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed. 
 Home sales revenues in our Southeast reportable segment decreased by 139.4 million, or 23.4 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 38.4 decrease in the number of homes closed driven by a decrease in the average community count at a lower absorption rate, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed. 
 Home sales revenues in our Northwest reportable segment decreased by 257.1 million, or 50.4 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 56.9 decrease in the number of homes closed driven by a decrease in the average community count at a lower absorption rate, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed. 
 Home sales revenues in our West reportable segment decreased by 50.3 million, or 14.3 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 24.5 decrease in the number of homes closed driven by a decrease in the average community count at a lower absorption rate, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed. 
 Home sales revenues in our Florida reportable segment decreased by 58.0 million, or 17.0 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 34.9 decrease in the number of homes closed driven by a decrease in the average community count at a lower absorption rate, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed for the majority of 2022. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin (home sales revenues less cost of sales). Cost of sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 1.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6 billion, or 25.7 , from 2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is primarily due to a 36.6 decrease in homes closed, offset by increased construction costs during 2022 as compared to 2021. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 646.6 million, a decrease of 171.4 million, or 21.0 , from 818.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues was 28.1 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 26.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase in gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to raising prices higher than increases in input costs. 
 Selling Expenses. Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 144.9 million, a decrease of 25.1 million, or 14.8 , from 170.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Sales commissions decreased to 82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 115.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a 24.4 decrease in home sales revenues during 2022 as compared to 2021. Selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 6.3 and 5.6 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues was driven primarily by higher advertising spend, partially offset by lower sales commission expensed during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 111.6 million, an increase of 11.2 million, or 11.2 , from 100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased overhead expenses. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 4.8 and 3.3 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues reflects our increased personnel and associated overhead costs, as well as professional fees and terminated land purchase agreements, partially offset by a decrease in management bonus and stock compensation incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2022. Loss on extinguishment of debt was 14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the redemption premium associated with our 2026 Senior Notes, as well as debt issuance costs and discount previously capitalized that were associated with our 2026 Senior Notes and debt issuance costs previously capitalized that were associated with our credit agreement then in effect. We redeemed all of our 2026 Senior Notes in July 2021. 
 Other Income. Other income, net of other expenses was 28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 19.0 million from 9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other income primarily reflects the sale in July 2022 of the three-year interest rate cap of LIBOR prior to its expiration that resulted in 7.1 million in other

 income, income associated with our investments in unconsolidated entities and gains realized from the sale of land and lots not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations. 
 Operating Income and Net Income before Income Taxes. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 390.1 million, a decrease of 157.6 million, or 28.8 , from 547.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 418.1 million, a decrease of 124.7 million, or 23.0 , from 542.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our reportable segments contributed the following amounts and percentages of net income before income taxes during 2022: Central - 213.2 million or 51.0 ; Southeast - 88.4 million or 21.1 ; Northwest - 51.0 million or 12.2 ; West - 26.6 million or 6.4 ; and Florida - 37.8 million or 9.0 . The decreases in operating income and net income before income taxes are primarily attributed to lower home sales revenues and lower home closings, partially offset by higher average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Income Taxes . Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 91.5 million, a decrease of 21.6 million, or 19.1 , from income tax provision of 113.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in our effective tax rate to 21.9 from 20.8 results from an increase in the compensation limitation under Section 162(m) of the Code, and the retroactive extension of the 45L tax credit, offset by deductions in excess of compensation cost for share-based payments for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Net Income . Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 326.6 million, a decrease of 103.1 million, or 24.0 , from 429.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to overall lower number of homes closed across all reportable segments, partially offset by higher average sales price per home closed at higher gross margins on a per home basis, during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Home Sales Revenues . Home sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 3.1 billion, an increase of 682.2 million, or 28.8 , from 2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in home sales revenues is primarily due to an 11.8 increase in homes closed and an increase in the average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We closed 10,442 homes during 2021, as compared to 9,339 homes closed during 2020. The average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 292,104, an increase of 38,551, or 15.2 , from the average sales price per home closed of 253,553 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in the average sales price per home closed was primarily due to higher price points in certain markets, partially offset by additional wholesale home closings. The overall increase in home closings was primarily driven by strong demand in all reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall decrease in average community count relates to timing associated with the opening, close out or transition between certain active communities during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 We increased our home sales revenues in our reportable segments other than our Central reportable segment by 279.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 1.6 increase in the number of homes closed in these reportable segments and increased average sales price per home closed on a consolidated basis during 2021 as compared to 2020. 
 Home sales revenues in our Central reportable segment increased by 402.4 million, or 47.3 , during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed at a higher average sales price per home closed and increased average community count at a higher absorption rate in this reportable segment.

 Home sales revenues in our Southeast reportable segment increased by 35.5 million, or 6.4 , during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher average sales price per home closed and improved absorption rate associated with increased closings in certain markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, partially offset by lower community count at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. 
 Home sales revenues in our Northwest reportable segment increased by 121.0 million, or 31.1 , during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a 16.6 increase in the number of homes closed in this reportable segment, as a result of increased demand. 
 Home sales revenues in our West reportable segment increased by 65.1 million, or 22.7 , during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher average sales price per home closed and improved absorption rate associated with increased demand in certain markets in this reportable segment, partially offset by lower average community count. 
 Home sales revenues in our Florida reportable segment increased by 58.2 million, or 20.6 , largely due to an increase of 13.7 in the average sales price per home closed as a result of strong demand and complemented by increased average community count during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin (home sales revenues less cost of sales). Cost of sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.2 billion, an increase of 467.3 million, or 26.5 , from 1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an 11.8 increase in homes closed, higher construction costs and product mix during 2021 as compared to 2020. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 818.0 million, an increase of 214.9 million, or 35.6 , from 603.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues was 26.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 25.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to raising prices higher than increases in input costs. 
 Selling Expenses. Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 170.0 million, an increase of 21.6 million, or 14.6 , from 148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales commissions increased to 115.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 partially due to a 28.8 increase in home sales revenues during 2021 as compared to 2020. Selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 5.6 and 6.3 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues was driven primarily by operating leverage obtained from the increase in home sales revenues and to a lesser extent lower advertising expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 100.3 million, an increase of 10.3 million, or 11.5 , from 90.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased overhead. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 3.3 and 3.8 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues reflects operating leverage realized from the increase in home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was 14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the redemption premium associated with the optional redemption of our 6.875 Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Senior Notes ), as well as debt issuance costs and discount previously capitalized that were associated with our 2026 Senior Notes and debt issuance costs previously capitalized that were associated with our credit agreement then in effect. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Other Income. Other income, net of other expenses was 9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 5.9 million from 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in other income primarily reflects the gain realized from the sale of lots not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations. 
 Operating Inco me and Net Income before Income Taxes. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 547.7 million, an increase of 183.0 million, or 50.2 , from 364.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 542.8 million, an increase of 174.9 million, or 47.6 , from 367.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our reportable segments contributed the following amounts and percentages of net income before income taxes during 2021: Central - 242.6 million or 44.7 ; Southeast - 105.6 million or 19.5 ; Northwest - 115.0 million or 21.2 ; West - 50.8 million or 9.4 ; and Florida - 49.9 million or 9.2 . The increases in operating income and net income before income taxes are primarily attributed to operating leverage realized from

 the increase in home sales revenues and higher average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Income Taxes . Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 113.1 million, an increase of 69.2 million, or 157.4 , from income tax provision of 44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the amount of income tax provision is primarily due to the retroactive tax benefits relating to the federal energy efficient homes tax credits we recognized during 2020 and the 47.6 increase in net income before taxes, which resulted in an increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 20.8 from 11.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Net Income . Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 429.6 million, an increase of 105.8 million, or 32.6 , from 323.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to operating leverage realized from the increase in home sales revenues and higher average sales price per home closed, partially offset by tax benefits relating to the federal energy efficient homes tax credits we recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we have provided information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to adjusted gross margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. 
 Adjusted Gross Margin 
 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. 
 The following table reconciles adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Home sales revenues 2,304,455 3,050,149 2,367,929 Cost of sales 1,657,855 2,232,115 1,764,832 Gross margin 646,600 818,034 603,097 Capitalized interest charged to cost of sales 20,276 37,546 40,381 Purchase accounting adjustments (1)

 28.1 26.8 25.5 Adjusted gross margin (2) 
 29.2 28.2 27.4 
 (1) Adjustments result from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and represent the amount of the fair value step-up adjustments included in cost of sales for real estate inventory sold after the acquisition dates. 
 (2) Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental measures in evaluating operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vi) other income, net and (vii) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in cost of sales. Our management believes that the presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization and items considered to be unusual or non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that these measures are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define these measures differently and, as a result, our measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the measures of other companies. Although we use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, the use of these measures is limited because they do not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 (i) they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, including for purchase of land; 
 (ii) they do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
 (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements or improvements; 
 (iv) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; 
 (v) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and 
 (vi) other companies in our industry may calculate them differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measures, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. These GAAP measures include operating income, net income and cash flow data. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in our EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to any other measure of performance in conformity with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. You should therefore not place undue reliance on our EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA calculated using these measures. 
 The following table reconciles EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the GAAP measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net income 326,567 429,645 323,895 Income tax provision 91,549 113,130 43,954 Depreciation and amortization 1,576 1,154 710 Capitalized interest charged to cost of sales 20,276 37,546 40,381 EBITDA 439,968 581,475 408,940 Purchase accounting adjustments (1)

 Backlog 
 We sell our homes under standard purchase contracts, which generally require a homebuyer to pay a deposit at the time of signing the purchase contract. The amount of the required deposit is minimal (typically 1,000 to 10,000). We permit our retail homebuyers to cancel the purchase contract and obtain a refund of their deposit in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within a certain period of time, as specified in their purchase contract. Typically, our retail homebuyers provide documentation regarding their ability to obtain mortgage financing within 14 days after the purchase contract is signed. If we determine that the homebuyer is not qualified to obtain mortgage financing or is not otherwise financially able to purchase the home, we will terminate the purchase contract. If a purchase contract has not been cancelled or terminated within 14 days after the purchase contract has been signed, then the homebuyer has met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing. Only purchase contracts that are signed by homebuyers who have met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing are included in new (gross) orders. 
 Our backlog consists of homes that are under a purchase contract that has been signed by homebuyers who have met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing but have not yet closed and wholesale contracts for which vertical construction is generally set to occur within the next six to twelve months . Since our business model is generally based on building move-in ready homes before a purchase contract is signed, the majority of our homes in backlog are currently under construction or complete. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net orders (new orders for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes closed during the current period. Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations, the number of our active communities and the timing of home closings. Homes in backlog are generally closed within one to two months, although home closings have been, and may continue to be, delayed. In addition, we may experience cancellations of purchase contracts at any time prior to closing. It is important to note that net orders, backlog and cancellation metrics are operational, rather than accounting data, and should be used only as a general gauge to evaluate performance. Backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, and in light of our minimal required deposit, there is little negative impact to the potential homebuyer from the cancellation of the purchase contract. 
 Our net orders decreased in 2022 primarily due to the sharp rise in mortgage rates as homebuyer demand softened, combined with historically low levels of finished lots resulting from years of sustained demand and the rapid pace of fluctuating rising costs for certain supplies and labor, previously experienced in 2021. Our wholesale orders decreased 67.4 to 157 units at December 31, 2022 from 481 units at December 31, 2021. 
 As of the dates set forth below, our net orders, cancellation rate, and ending backlog homes and value were as follows (dollars in thousands):

 252,002 659,234 775,468 
 (1) Net orders are new (gross) orders for the purchase of homes during the period, less cancellations of existing purchase contracts during the period. 
 (2) Cancellation rate for a period is the total number of purchase contracts cancelled during the period divided by the total new (gross) orders for the purchase of homes during the period. 
 (3) Ending backlog consists of retail homes at the end of the period that are under a purchase contract that has been signed by homebuyers who have met our preliminary financing criteria but have not yet closed and wholesale contracts for which vertical construction is generally set to occur within the next six to twelve months. Ending backlog is valued at the contract amount. 
 (4) As of December 31, 2022, we had 157 units related to bulk sales agreements associated with our wholesale business. 
 (5) As of December 31, 2021, we had 481 units related to bulk sales agreements associated with our wholesale business. 
 (6) As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,139 units related to bulk sales agreements associated with our wholesale business.

 Seasonality 
 In all of our reportable segments, we have historically experienced similar variability in our results of operations and in capital requirements from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. We generally close more homes in our second, third and fourth quarters. Thus, our revenues may fluctuate on a quarterly basis and we may have higher capital requirements in our second, third and fourth quarters in order to maintain our inventory levels. Our revenues and capital requirements are generally similar across our second, third and fourth quarters. 
 As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular quarter, especially the first quarter, are not necessarily representative of the results we expect at year end. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue in the long term. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 32.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash flows for each of our active communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings. 
 Our principal uses of capital are operating expenses, land and lot purchases, lot development, home construction, interest costs on our indebtedness and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, we may purchase land, lots, homes under construction or other assets as part of an acquisition and repurchase shares of our common stock. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, land development, plats, vertical development, construction of information centers, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of home sales revenues. In the later stages of an active community, cash inflows may exceed home sales revenues reported for financial statement purposes, as the costs associated with home and land construction were previously incurred. 
 Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generally rely on our ability to finance our operations by generating operating cash flows and borrowing under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) to adequately fund our short-term working capital obligations and to purchase land and other assets, develop lots and homes and repurchase shares of our common stock. As needed, we will consider accessing the debt and equity capital markets as part of our ongoing financing strategy. We rely on our ability to obtain performance, payment and completion surety bonds as well as letters of credit to finance our projects. Furthermore, we utilize, on a limited and strategic basis, land banking financing arrangements to access short-term liquidity. 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we will be able to fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months with our cash on hand, cash generated from operations and cash expected to be available from the Credit Agreement or through accessing debt or equity capital, as needed. However, with the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, our ability to engage in the transactions described above may be constrained by volatile or tight economic, capital, credit and financial market conditions, as well as moderated investor or lender interest or capacity and our liquidity, leverage and net worth, and we can provide no assurance as to successfully completing, the costs of, or the operational limitations arising from any one or series of such transactions. 
 Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our long-term principal uses of liquidity and capital resources will be inventory related purchases concerning land, lot development, repurchases of shares of our common stock, other capital expenditures, and principal and interest payments on our debt obligations maturing in 2025 and 2029. We believe that we will be able to fund our long-term liquidity needs with cash generated from operations and cash expected to be available to borrow under the Credit Agreement or through accessing debt or equity capital, as needed, although no assurance can be provided that such additional debt or equity capital will be available when needed or on terms that we find attractive. Additionally, we plan to further utilize, on a limited and strategic basis, land banking financing arrangements to maximize long-term liquidity for lot development projects where we have sufficient finished lot availability in certain markets. To the extent these sources of capital are insufficient to meet our 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 needs, we may also conduct additional public or private offerings of our securities, refinance our indebtedness, or dispose of certain assets to fund our operating activities and capital needs. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 The following is a summary of our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. 
 Payments due by period (in thousands) Total Note 6 Notes Payable to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our long-term debt. 
 (b) Represents 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.000 2029 Senior Notes. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029. See Note 6 Notes Payable to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our long-term debt. 
 (c) All of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are at variable rates based on SOFR, or subject to an interest rate floor. The interest rate for our variable rate indebtedness as of December 31, 2022 was SOFR plus 1.85 . Fees under the Credit Agreement are approximately 0.1 million per year. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 4.000 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Interest related to the land banking financing arrangements is not included in the table. 
 (d) The land banking financing arrangements may incur interest at time of purchase and are subject to certain performance obligations, financial and other penalties if the lots are not purchased and are excluded from the table. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land purchase contracts in order to procure land and lots for the construction of our homes. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots. These contracts typically require cash deposits and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers, which may include obtaining applicable property and development entitlements or the completion of development activities and the delivery of finished lots. We also utilize contracts with land sellers as a method of acquiring lots and land in staged takedowns, which helps us manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings and minimize the use of funds from our corporate financing sources. Such contracts generally require a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire land or lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. We generally have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under purchase contracts during the initial feasibility period and receive a refund of our deposit, or we may terminate the contracts after the end of the feasibility period by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial obligations to the land seller. In addition, our deposit may also be refundable if the land seller does not satisfy all conditions precedent in the respective contract. As of December 31, 2022, we had 22.4 million of cash deposits pertaining to land purchase contracts for 13,184 lots with an aggregate purchase price of 411.8 million. Approximately 12.8 million of the cash deposits as of December 31, 2022 are secured by third-party guarantees or indemnity mortgages on the related property. 
 Our utilization of land purchase contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers willing to enter into contracts at acceptable terms, which may include option takedown arrangements, the availability of capital to financial intermediaries to finance the development of optioned lots, general housing conditions, and local market dynamics. Land purchase contracts may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain markets. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into that certain Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement and Second Amendment to Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with several financial institutions, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the Second Amendment and, as so amended, the Credit Agreement ), which 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 amended that certain Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2021, with several financial institutions, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the 2021 Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement contains revolving commitments of 1.1 billion, subject to a borrowing base primarily consisting of a percentage of commercial land, land held for development, lots under development and finished lots held by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement matures on April 28, 2025. Before each anniversary of the Credit Agreement, we may request a one-year extension of its maturity date. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by, among others, each of our subsidiaries that have gross assets of at least 0.5 million. 
 The borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with the outstanding principal balance of our 4.000 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes ), may not exceed the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement was 1.4 billion, of which borrowings, including the 2029 Senior Notes, of 1.1 billion were outstanding, 33.4 million of letters of credit were outstanding and 236.6 million was available to borrow under the Credit Agreement. 
 For a further description of the Credit Agreement, please refer to Note 6 , Notes Payable to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Senior Notes Offering 
 On June 28, 2021, we issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes in an offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 4.000 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029. The terms of the 2029 Senior Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of July 6, 2018, and Third Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of June 28, 2021, as may be supplemented from time to time, among us, our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. 
 Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees 
 We are often required to provide letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. The amount of such obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our pending development activities. In the event any such bonds or letters of credit are drawn upon, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of such bonds or letters of credit. 
 Under these letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees, we are committed to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees under these arrangements, totaled 368.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to the improvements at these sites, the letters of credit and surety bonds are not generally released until all development and construction activities are completed. We do not believe that it is probable that any outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds or financial guarantees as of December 31, 2022 will be drawn upon. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In November 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors (the Board authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to 50.0 million of shares of our common stock through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable laws. In October 2020 and February 2022, the Board approved an increase in our stock repurchase program by an additional 300.0 million and 200.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 892,916 shares of our common stock for 95.1 million to be held as treasury stock, 1,288,563 shares of our common stock for 193.8 million to be held as treasury stock and 718,993 shares of our common stock for 48.1 million to be held as treasury stock, respectively. A total of 2,939,472 shares of our common stock has been repurchased since our stock repurchase program commenced. As of December 31, 2022, we may purchase up to 211.5 million of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The timing, amount and other terms and conditions of any repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program will be determined by our management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, corporate considerations, general market and economic conditions and legal requirements. Our stock repurchase program may be modified, discontinued or suspended at any time.

 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 370.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by cash outflow from the 823.9 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity, partially offset by net income of 326.6 million, as well as the 32.8 million decrease and 58.1 million increase in the net change in accounts receivable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 21.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by net income of 429.6 million, and included cash outflows from the 463.6 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity and a 58.0 million decrease in the net change in accounts receivable. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 202.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by net income of 323.9 million, offset by cash outflows from the 70.2 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity and a 59.5 million increase in the net change in accounts receivable. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to additional investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 70.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the business acquisitions of certain real estate assets owned by KenRoe Inc. and its affiliated entities, including R Home LLC and Paxmar Land Development, and the real estate assets of Buffington Homebuilding Group, Ltd. in 2021. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reflects the purchase of property and equipment and investment in unconsolidated entity. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 357.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by 618.9 million of borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement and the Credit Agreement and 149.5 million of proceeds related to financing arrangements with a third-party land banker. These were partially offset by 308.0 million of repayments on the Credit Agreement and by 95.1 million in payments for shares of our common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program to be held as treasury stock. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 63.3 million, primarily driven by borrowings of 1.2 billion under the 2021 Credit Agreement and the 2029 Senior Notes, offset by 969.0 million of payments associated with the 2026 Senior Notes and our credit agreement then in effect and by the 193.8 million payment for shares of our common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program to be held as treasury stock. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 198.9 million, primarily driven by 530.0 million of payments under our credit agreement then in effect and by the 48.1 million payment for shares of our common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program to be held as treasury stock, offset by borrowings of 377.1 million under our credit agreement then in effect. 
 Inflation 
 Our business can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material, and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers. In June 2022 we began to experience a moderation of buyer demand resulting from the Federal Reserve s ongoing actions to stem inflation, which ultimately resulted in higher mortgage rates for our homebuyers. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we have experienced a significant increase in land, labor, materials and construction costs, which we currently expect to continue throughout 2023. Generally, we have been able to increase the sales 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 prices of our homes to absorb such increased costs. See Industry and Economic Risks Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board. Discussed below are accounting policies that we believe are critical because of the significance of the activity to which they relate or because they require the use of significant judgment in their application. 
 Home Sales Revenue Recognition 
 We recognize home sales revenue upon the transfer of promised goods to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled by applying the following five-step process: 
 Identify the contract(s) with a customer 
 Identify the performance obligations 
 Determine the transaction price 
 Allocate the transaction price 
 Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met 
 Our contracts with customers include a single performance obligation to transfer a completed home to the customer. We generally determine selling price per home on the expected cost plus margin. Our contracts contain no significant financing terms as customers who finance do so through a third party. Performance obligations are satisfied at a moment in time when the home is complete and control of the asset is transferred to the customer at closing. Home sales proceeds are generally received from the title company within a few business days after closing. Little to no estimation is involved in recognizing such revenues. 
 Real Estate Inventory and Cost of Home Sales 
 Inventory consists of land, land under development, finished lots, information centers, homes in progress and completed homes. Inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying amount is determined not to be recoverable, in which case inventory is written down to fair value. 
 Pre-acquisition costs, land, development and other project costs, including interest and property taxes, incurred during development and home construction, and net of expected reimbursements of development costs, are capitalized to real estate inventory. Pre-acquisition costs, land development and other common costs that benefit the entire community, including field construction supervision and related direct overhead, are allocated to individual lots or homes, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis which we believe approximates the costs that would be determined using an allocation method based on relative sales values since the individual lots or homes within a community are similar in value. 
 We use judgements and assumptions to recognize the appropriate amount of cost of sales by estimating the total land development costs. We use estimates which are affected by changes to the land development project s schedule; the cost of labor, materials, and subcontractors; and potential cost reimbursements from various municipalities. Changes to estimated total remaining development costs subsequent to initial home closings in a community are allocated to the remaining unsold homes in the community on a prospective basis. Home construction costs and related carrying charges are allocated to the cost of individual homes using the specific identification method and are capitalized as they are incurred. Capitalized interest, property taxes, and other carrying costs are generally capitalized to real estate inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Costs associated with homes closed are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition. We believe that our policies provide for reasonably dependable estimates to be used in the calculation and reporting of land development and home construction costs. 
 Impairment of Real Estate Inventories 
 Real estate inventory is evaluated for indicators of impairment by each community during each reporting period. In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been closed, communities with slow moving inventory, projected margins on future home sales over the life of the community, and the estimated fair value of the land. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales prices and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. Due largely to the relatively short development and construction 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 periods for our communities and our growth, we have experienced limited circumstances during 2022, 2021 or 2020 that are indicators of impairment. Our future sales and margins may be impacted by our inability to realize continued growth, increased cost associated with holding and developing land, local economic factors, pressure on home sales prices, increased carrying costs, and insufficient access to labor and materials at reasonable costs. For individual communities with indicators of impairment, we perform additional analysis to estimate the community s undiscounted future cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value of the asset, no impairment adjustment is required. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value, the asset is impaired and is written down to its fair value. We estimate the fair value of communities using a discounted cash flow model; changes to the expected cash flows may lead to changes in the outcome of our impairment analysis. 
 We purchase both finished lots and land to be developed. Generally, the life cycle of a community ranges from two to five years. For projects we develop, the period between the acquisition of a raw piece of land and completion of the development of that land generally ranges from two to three years. During the life of a project, a constructed home is used as the community information center and then sold. Actual individual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether the property was purchased as raw land or finished lots. Sustained changes in the life cycle of a community, which is an indicator used for impairment, may negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Impairment of Land and Land Under Development 
 For raw land, land under development and completed lots that our management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or to be sold as finished lots to individuals, the recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home or lot sales, consistent with the evaluation of operating communities discussed above. As of December 31, 2022, we had not identified any raw land, land under development or completed lots that management intends to market for sale in bulk to a third-party. 
 Pre-acquisition Costs and Controlled Lots Not Owned 
 We enter into land purchase agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these agreements, we typically provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. We do not have title to the property and our obligations with respect to the contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related nonrefundable cash deposits. 
 To the extent that any deposits are nonrefundable and the associated land acquisition process is terminated or no longer determined probable, the deposit and any related pre-acquisition costs (e.g. due diligence costs) are charged to general and administrative expense. Assessments are made on each agreement based on criteria including, but not limited to, market absorption, historical and current average sales price per home, timing of purchase and size of land parcel. We terminated 6.7 million, 2.4 million and 2.1 million of nonrefundable pre-acquisition costs or controlled lots deposits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We regularly review the likelihood of the acquisition of contracted lots in conjunction with our periodic real estate impairment analysis. 
 Warranty Reserves 
 We typically provide homebuyers with a one-year warranty on the house and a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements. Estimated future direct warranty costs are assessed monthly on a consistent basis as part of our policy and accrued and charged to cost of sales in connection with our home sales. 
 The primary assumption to record amounts accrued for our warranty liability is based upon a trailing 120 month period of historical warranty cost experience on a per house basis established based on (i) trends in historical warranty payment levels, (ii) the historical range of amounts paid per house, (iii) any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring, and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built, the geographic areas in which they are built, and potential impacts of our expansion. Our analysis also considers improvements in quality control and construction techniques expected to impact future warranty expenditures and the expertise of our personnel. Our warranty reserves are reviewed quarterly to assess the reasonableness and adequacy and we make adjustments to the balance of the pre-existing reserves, as needed, to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. We increased our warranty reserve by 2.9 million, 2.5 million and 1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Business Acquisitions 
 We account for certain homebuilding asset purchases as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with excess recorded as goodwill. The acquisition method of accounting 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the acquired assets. We determine the estimated fair values of the real estate inventory with the assistance of appraisals performed by independent third-party specialists and estimates by management. Assumptions utilized in our estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired may include market comparisons, gross margin comparisons, future development costs and the timing of the completion of development activities, absorption rates, and mix of products sold in each community. 
 Taxes 
 We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, changes in tax rate are recognized in the year of enactment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets is assessed throughout the year and a valuation allowance is established, if required. We compute our provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates. Judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our annual tax provision. We recognize the impact of a tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, as applicable.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our operations are interest rate sensitive. As overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates, a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing. Higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues, gross margin, and net income. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Interest Rate Risk 
 We utilize both fixed-rate debt 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes and certain inventory related obligations) and variable-rate debt (our 1.1 billion Credit Agreement) as part of financing our operations. We do not have the obligation to prepay the 2029 Senior Notes or our fixed-rate inventory related obligations prior to maturity, and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt. 
 In November 2020, we entered into a three-year interest rate cap of LIBOR of 0.70 to hedge a portion of the 2021 Credit Agreement risk exposure and future variable cash flows associated with LIBOR interest rates. In July 2022, we sold this three-year interest rate cap prior to its expiration. We currently do not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future. Many of the statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we had 828.4 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement. All of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are at variable rates based on SOFR. The interest rate for our variable rate indebtedness as of December 31, 2022 was SOFR plus 1.85 . At December 31, 2022, SOFR was 4.32 , subject to the 0.50 SOFR floor as included in the Credit Agreement. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate above the SOFR floor on our variable rate indebtedness would increase our annual interest cost by approximately 8.3 million. 
 Based on the current interest rate management policies we have in place with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, we do not believe that the future interest rate risks related to our existing indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of LGI Homes, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LGI Homes, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

 Land development costs Description of the Matter For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s cost of sales was approximately 1.7 billion, which includes construction costs of each closed home and allocable land acquisition and land development costs, capitalized interest, and other related costs. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, land development costs that are not specifically identifiable to a home are allocated on a pro rata basis. At the time of home closings, land development activities may not be finalized. To recognize the appropriate amount of cost of sales, the Company estimates the total remaining development costs. Estimates are affected by changes to the land development project s schedule; the cost of labor, materials, and subcontractors; and potential cost reimbursements from various municipalities. 
 Auditing the Company's land development cost measurement was complex and subjective due to the significant estimation required to determine the costs to complete land development. Specifically, the land development cost estimate is sensitive to significant management assumptions, including the project s schedule, estimated cost of labor, materials and subcontractors and potential reimbursements. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's process and controls over its land development cost measurement, including controls over management's review of the estimated costs to complete. 
 To test the Company's land development cost measurement, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated costs to complete the land development projects and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we sampled the Company s land development project budgets and agreed the estimated development costs and cost reimbursements to supporting documentation, including underlying contracts; and performed observational procedures to understand the completeness of development activities included in the estimated land development costs. In addition, we performed lookback analyses to historical actual costs to assess management s ability to estimate and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in total costs of land development that would result from changes in these assumptions.

 . For projects we develop, the period between the acquisition of a raw piece of land and completion of the development of that land generally ranges from two to . During the life of a project, a constructed home is used as the community information center and then sold. Actual individual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether the property was purchased as raw land or finished lots. 
 Interest and financing costs incurred under our debt obligations, as more fully discussed in Note 6 , are capitalized to qualifying real estate projects under development and homes under construction. 
 We have land banking financing arrangements with a third-party land banker to repurchase land that we sold to the land banker as a method of acquiring finished lots in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and minimizing the use of funds from our available cash or other financing sources. In consideration for this repurchase option, we paid a non-refundable commitment fee. Based on our right to control the ultimate economic outcome of these finished lots, these assets will be held as real estate not owned within our inventory as shown in tabular form in Note 3 and a corresponding obligation was established within our accrued liabilities as more fully discussed in Note 5 to recognize this relationship. While we are not legally obligated to repurchase the balance of the lots, we will be subject to certain performance obligations, financial and other penalties if the lots are not purchased. We do not have any ownership interest or title to the assets that we have sold to the land banker and we do not guarantee any of the land banker s liabilities. 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , real estate inventory is evaluated for indicators of impairment by each community during each reporting period. In conducting its review for indicators of impairment on a community level, management evaluates, among other things, the margins on homes that have been closed, communities with slow moving inventory, projected margins on future home sales over the life of the community, and the estimated fair value of the land. For individual communities with indicators of impairment, additional analysis is performed to estimate the community s undiscounted future cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value of the community group of assets, no impairment adjustment is required. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the community s carrying value, the asset group is impaired and is written down to its fair value. We estimate the fair value of communities using a discounted cash flow model. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the real estate inventory is stated at cost; there were inventory impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 million of goodwill is related to the reorganization transactions completed in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in November 2013. In applying the goodwill impairment test, we have the option to perform a qualitative test. Under the optional qualitative test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, we determine it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then performing a quantitative test is necessary.

 Land Banking Financing Arrangements 
 We have entered into land banking financing arrangements with a third-party land banker to repurchase land that we sold to the land banker as a method of acquiring finished lots in staged takedowns. Principal payments on these financing arrangements will generally coincide with the repurchase of lot takedowns from the land banker. We expect to complete the repurchase of all lots via takedowns associated with these transactions over the course of approximately two to four years. 
 Inventory Related Obligations 
 We own lots in certain communities in Arizona, Florida, and Texas that have Community Development Districts or similar utility and infrastructure development special assessment programs that allocate a fixed amount of debt service associated with development activities to each lot. This obligation for infrastructure development is attached to the land, which is typically payable over a period, and is ultimately assumed by the homebuyer when home sales are closed. The obligations assumed by the homebuyer represent a non-cash cost of the lots. 
 Estimated Warranty Reserve 
 We typically provide homebuyers with a warranty on the house and a limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems.

 We generate revenues primarily by delivering move-in ready entry-level and move-up spec homes sold under our LGI Homes brand and our luxury series spec homes sold under our Terrata Homes brand. 
 Retail homes sold under both our LGI Homes brand and Terrata Homes brand focus on providing move-in ready homes with standardized features within favorable markets that meet certain demographic and economic conditions. Our LGI Homes brand primarily markets to entry-level or first-time homebuyers, while our Terrata Homes brand primarily markets to move-up homebuyers. 
 Wholesale homes are primarily sold under a bulk sales agreement and focus on providing move-in ready homes with standardized features to real estate investors that will ultimately use the single-family homes as rental properties. 
 Performance Obligations 
 Our contracts with customers include a single performance obligation to transfer a completed home to the customer. We generally determine selling price per home on the expected cost plus margin. Our contracts contain no significant financing terms as customers who finance do so through a third party. Performance obligations are satisfied at a moment in time when the home is complete and control of the asset is transferred to the customer at closing. Home sales proceeds are generally received from the title company within a few business days after closing. 
 Sales and broker commissions are incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management of LGI Homes, Inc. (the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 
 In connection with respect to the preparation of the Company s annual consolidated financial statements, and the processes under which they were prepared, management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the 2013 COSO framework). Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting which appears below.
