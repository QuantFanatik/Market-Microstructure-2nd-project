Industry Developments 

Bank of America, National Association BANA issues credit cards on MasterCard s and Visa s networks. MasterCard and Visa are subject to settlement obligations relating to certain litigations and continue to be
 subject to significant ongoing litigations, including class actions, and increased competition. These settlements and litigations are based on, among other things, claimed violations of United States federal antitrust laws, claims that currency
 conversion fees were wrongly applied on purchases of goods and services in foreign countries, and claims alleging that the interchange charged by MasterCard and Visa is impermissible. The costs associated with these settlements, litigations and
 other matters could cause MasterCard and Visa to invest less in their networks and marketing efforts and could adversely affect the interchange paid to their member banks, including BANA.

Litigation 

In 2005, a group of merchants filed a series of putative class actions and individual actions directed at interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. These actions, which were
 consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation (Interchange), named Visa,
 MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies, including Bank of America Corporation BAC ), as defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to fix the level of default interchange rates and that certain rules of Visa and
 MasterCard were unreasonable restraints of trade. Plaintiffs sought compensatory and treble damages and injunctive relief. 

2 

On October 19, 2012, defendants reached a settlement with respect to the putative class actions that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected. In 2018, defendants reached a settlement with the
 representatives of the putative Rule 23(b)(3) damages class to contribute an additional 900 million to the approximately 5.3 billion held in escrow from the prior settlement. BAC s additional contribution is not material to BAC. The District
 Court approved that settlement with the putative Rule 23(b)(3) damages class on December 13, 2019, but that approval is being appealed.

In addition, the Rule 23(b)(2) action seeking injunctive relief is pending with a class certified on September 27, 2021, and a number of individual merchant actions continue against the defendants, including one
 against BAC. As a result of various loss-sharing agreements, however, BAC remains liable for a portion of any settlement or judgment in individual actions where it is not named as a defendant.

Legal Proceedings Involving The Bank of New York Mellon

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., and BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (collectively, BNY Mellon are named as a defendant in legal
 actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization RMBS transactions, BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that
 the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict
 the eventual outcomes of pending actions, BNY Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.

The Bank of New York Mellon has provided us with the information in the paragraph above in response to the requirements of Regulation AB. Other than the above paragraph and the information concerning The Bank of
 New York Mellon specified in this Form 10-K under the caption Item 1122 of Regulation AB: Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria and in Exhibit 33.2 to this Form 10-K, The Bank of New York Mellon has
 not participated in the preparation of, and is not responsible for, any other information contained in this Form 10-K.

Item 1122 of Regulation AB: Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.

Each of BANA, with respect to itself and its affiliated servicing participants, and The Bank of New York Mellon (each, a Servicing Participant has been identified by the registrant as a party participating in the
 servicing function with respect to the pool assets held by each of BA Master Credit Card Trust II and BA Credit Card Trust. Each Servicing Participant has completed a report on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to
 such Servicing Participant (each, a Report on Assessment ), which Reports on Assessment are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each of the Servicing Participants has provided an attestation report (each, an Attestation Report by a registered independent public accounting firm regarding its related Report on Assessment. Each Attestation Report is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. We have not independently verified the accuracy of The Bank of New York Mellon s
 assertions or the related attestations of its registered independent public accounting firm.

A Servicing Participant may engage one or more vendors to perform specific and limited activities that address all or a portion of one or more servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant. Each
 Servicing Participant indicates that it has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether its vendors activities comply in all material respects with such servicing criteria, and has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
 with the servicing criteria applicable to its vendors activities in such Servicing Participant s Report on Assessment.

No Report on Assessment or related Attestation Report has identified (i) any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria identified in such Report on Assessment as applicable to the related Servicing
 Participant or (ii) any material deficiency in such Servicing Participant s policies and procedures to monitor vendor compliance.

Platform-Level Reports :

Regulations of the SEC require that each servicing participant complete a report on assessment at a platform level, meaning that the transactions covered by the report on assessment should include all asset-backed
 securities transactions involving such servicing participant that are backed by the same asset type. Subsequent guidance from the SEC staff identifies additional parameters that a servicing participant may apply to define and further limit its
 platform. For example, a servicing participant may define its platform to include only transactions that were completed on or after January 1, 2006 (the effective date for Regulation AB) and that were registered with the SEC pursuant to the
 Securities Act of 1933. Each servicing participant is responsible for defining its own platform, and each platform will naturally differ based on various factors, including the servicing participant s business model, the transactions in which it
 is involved and the range of activities performed in those transactions.

Item 1123 of Regulation AB: Servicer Compliance Statement. 

BANA has been identified by the registrant as a servicer with respect to the pool assets held by each of BA Master Credit Card Trust II and BA Credit Card Trust. BANA has provided a statement of compliance with the
 related servicing agreement (the Compliance Statement ), signed by an authorized officer of BANA. The Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

Management of The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.),
 (collectively, the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s management has
 determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows:

Platform : Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after
 January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services, as defined and to
 the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ). 

Period : The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except as set
 forth in the column titled Not Applicable to Platform in Appendix 1 attached hereto. 

With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company s management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the servicing criterion. The Company s management has determined that this vendor
 is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). The Company s management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
 vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor
 and related servicing criterion.

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

1. The Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

2. The Company s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above as of and for the Period. In making
 this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

3. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction
 agreements) to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
 jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements). As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not
 instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the Company s responsibility for criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of
 holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in
 the transaction agreement.

4. Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors of Bank of America, National Association

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that Bank of America, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set
 forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for asset-backed securities transactions backed by credit card receivables issued by the BA Credit Card Trust on or before December 31, 2022, for which transactions the
 Company acted as servicer, that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the period from January 1, 2022 to
 December 31, 2022 (the Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(x),
 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. Appendix B to management s assertion identifies the individual
 asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Bank of America, National Association s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
 criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
 Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
 accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
 of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
 selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
 designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We
 believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the
 servicing criteria.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.

In our opinion, management s assertion that Bank of America, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material
 respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors
 The Bank of New York Mellon

 BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware

 The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.:

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria that The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware
 (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
 Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after
 January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent, or custodial services, as defined and
 to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), 1122(d)(4)(xiv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the
 Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect to Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company
 has determined that for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) to file, or cause to
 be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the
 Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements). Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria indicates that as of and for the twelve
 months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform such activities, the Company s responsibility for Servicing Criterion
 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities
 performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management s Assessment of
 Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for
 the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
 to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test

basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and
 securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
 Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors
 may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
 We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement.

As described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the
 activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
 compliance with the Servicing Criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06).
 As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the Servicing Criterion
 applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related Servicing Criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no
 procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on
 C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
