Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. PART I Item 1. Business General Servotronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the Registrant or the Company design, manufacture and market advanced technology products consisting primarily of control components and consumer products consisting of knives and various types of cutlery and other edged products. The Company operates through two primary segments: the Advanced Technology Group (ATG) and the Consumer Products Group (CPG). The Company was incorporated in New York in 1959. In 1972, the Company was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, thereby changing the Company s state of incorporation from New York to Delaware. The Company s shares currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE American) under the symbol SVT. Products Advanced Technology Products (ATG) The Company designs, manufactures and markets a variety of servo-control components which convert an electrical current into a mechanical force or movement and other related products. The principal servo-control components produced include torque motors, electromagnetic actuators, hydraulic valves, pneumatic valves and similar devices, all of which perform the same general function. These are sold principally to the commercial aerospace, aircraft and government related industries, as well as medical and industrial markets. To fill most of its orders for components, the Company must either modify a standard model or design a new product in order to satisfy the customer s particular requirements. The Company also produces unique products based on specifications provided by its customers. The Company produces under long-term contracts and other types of orders. The Company may from time to time produce metallic seals of various cross-sectional configurations. These seals fit between two surfaces, usually metal, to produce a more secure and leak-proof joint. The Company manufactures these seals to close tolerances from standard and special alloy steels. Ductile coatings are often applied to the seals in order to increase their effectiveness.

 The Company has also produced other products of its own and/or of a given design to meet customers requirements. Consumer Products (CPG) The Company designs, manufactures and sells a variety of cutlery products. These products include a wide range of kitchen knives such as steak, carving, bread, butcher and paring knives for household use and for use in restaurants, institutions and private industry, as well as other types of knives for hunting, fishing and camping. The Company sells cutlery products to the U.S. Government, related agencies and allied foreign governments. These products include machetes, bayonets and other types of knives that are primarily for military use. The Company also produces and markets other cutlery items such as carving forks and various specialty tools such as putty knives, linoleum sheet cutters and field knives. The Company manufactures its cutlery products from stainless or high carbon steel in numerous styles, designs, models and sizes. Substantially all of the Company s commercial cutlery related products are intended for the medium to premium priced markets. Sales, Marketing and Distribution Advanced Technology Products The Company s ATG products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Products are primarily non-seasonal in nature. These products are sold to commercial aviation manufacturers, government prime contractors, government subcontractors, and end-users. Sales are made primarily by the Company s professional staff. The Company s prime contracts and subcontracts with United States Government subcontractors and commercial manufacturers are subject to termination at the convenience of the customer. In the event of such termination, the Company is ordinarily entitled to receive payment for its costs and profits on work done prior to termination. Since the inception of the Company s business, less than 1 of its contracts have been terminated for convenience. The Company s sales of advanced technology products are composed primarily of a small group of customers. The Company has a significant concentration of business with two major customers: Customer A and Customer B. Sales to Customer A accounted for 30.1 of consolidated sales in 2022 and 33.5 of consolidated sales in 2021. Sales to Customer B accounted for 18.9 of consolidated sales in 2022 and 19.1 of consolidated sales in 2021. In 2022 and 2021 we had a concentration of sales to Customer A and Customer B representing approximately 49.0 and 52.6 of our consolidated sales, respectively. The ATG revenue increased approximately 3,500,000 or 11.0 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Customer A revenue decreased approximately 393,000 or (2.9) in 2022 as compared to 2021. Customer B revenue increased approximately 503,000 or 6.5 in 2022 as compared to 2021. The loss of either of these customers would have a significant impact on our revenue and earnings. See Note 1, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Concentration of Credit Risks, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to sales concentrations. Consumer Products The Company s consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The Company s Consumer Products Group (CPG) also sells its knives and tools (principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives) to various branches of the United States Government. Additionally, the Company provides OEM and white label product design and manufacturing services to a regional customer base across a wide range of consumer and commercial industries. No single customer of the CPG represented more than 10 of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2022 or 2021. The Company sells its products and manufacturing services through its own sales resources, independent manufacturers representatives and electronic commerce.

 Business Segments Business segment information is presented in Note 10, Business Segments, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Intellectual Properties The Company has rights under certain copyrights, trademarks, patents, and registered domain names. In the view of management, the Company s competitive position is not dependent on patent protection. Research Activities Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Environmental Compliance The cost of compliance with current environmental laws has not been material and the Company does not anticipate that it will be in the future. The Company does not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company s business, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. Manufacturing The Company manufactures its ATG products in Elma, New York and Franklinville, New York and its CPG products in Franklinville, New York. Raw Materials and Other Supplies The Company purchases raw materials and certain components for its products from outside vendors. The Company is generally not dependent upon a single source of supply for any raw material or component used in its operations. We believe the loss of any one supplier, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic and supply chain disruptions, the Company continues to face upward pricing pressure on certain parts and raw materials. Competition Although no reliable industry statistics are available to enable the Company to determine accurately its relative competitive position with respect to any of its products, the Company believes that it is a significant factor with respect to certain of its servo-control components within its competitive market. The Company s share of the overall cutlery market is not significant. The Company has many different competitors with respect to servo-control components because of the nature of that business and the fact that these products also face competition from other types of control components which, at times, can accomplish the desired result. Many of these competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than the Company. The Company encounters active competition with respect to its consumer products from numerous companies, many of which are larger in terms of manufacturing capacity, financial resources and marketing organization. Its principal competitors vary depending upon the customer and/or the products involved. The Company believes that it competes primarily with more than 20 companies with respect to its consumer products, in addition to foreign imports. To the Company s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to cutlery include Corelle Brands Holdings, Inc., Benchmade Knife Company, Inc., Tramontina, Inc., Dexter-Russell Inc., W. R. Case Sons Cutlery Company, Lifetime Brands, Inc., Cutco Corporation and Gerber. The Company also competes with other regional manufacturing companies for its molded plastic and metal and plastic fabrication services. To the Company s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to manufacturing services include PM Plastics, Monarch Plastics and Ontario Plastics.

 The Company markets most of its products throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in select foreign markets. The Company believes that it competes in marketing its servo-control products primarily on the basis of operating performance, adherence to rigid specifications, quality, price and delivery and its consumer products primarily on the basis of price, quality and delivery.

 Business Overview The aviation and aerospace industries as well as markets for the Company s consumer products continually face evolving challenges on a global basis. The operations of the Company can be affected by the trends of the economy, including interest rates, income tax laws, government regulation, legislation, and other factors. In addition, uncertainties in today s global economy, competition from expanding manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of low-cost developing countries and emerging markets, currency policies in relation to the U.S. dollar of some major foreign exporting countries, the effect of terrorism, difficulty in predicting defense and other government appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company s customers to fund long-term purchase programs, volatile market demand and the continued market acceptance of the Company s advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact on future financial results. Both the ATG and CPG markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies, which may create volatility in operating results from period to period. For example, the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions. These factors directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on in-service aircraft. The Company s suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions. Any interruption of the Company s continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the Company s products could adversely impact the Company s ability to meet the Company s customers delivery requirements. Consistent with the evolving requirements of the aerospace industry, companies are increasingly being requested to operate under long-term agreements with their customers on the basis of fixed prices, targeted year to year price reductions and/or year to year price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices and/or a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements and/or otherwise. Therefore, productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the Company s concept of continuous improvement. The Company s products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected to have positive effects on the Company s operating results. However, increased costs for raw material, purchased parts and/or labor will have the reverse effect. If any adverse economic events reduce the number of airliners and/or aircraft being produced by the Company s relevant prime contractors, the negative effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain. Also, certain major manufacturers have successfully imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers. At times, these extended payment terms are not available to the Company when purchasing raw material such as aluminum, magnetic material, steel and/or other product support items and services. If the Company s customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay, it could adversely impact the Company s operating results and cash flow. During 2022, inflation negatively impacted our input costs, primarily for labor and materials. Supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and global inflation remain persistant. Maximizing the Company s operations and resources requires continued dedicated performances from the Company s key and other personnel. In the Company s markets and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals. Any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis (provided they are available) and may temporarily interrupt the Company s operations and efforts for continuous improvement. On March 30, 2023, the Company announced that the Company s Board of Directors has authorized the review of the strategic alternatives for the CPG with a goal of enhancing shareholder value. This review was authorized by the Board on February 28, 2023 and the company has engaged a financial advisor to evaluate potential alternatives. There is no set timetable for the strategic review process and there can be no assurance that such review will result in any transaction or other alternative.

 Management Discussion There was an increase in consolidated revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 from 2021 of approximately 3,263,000 or 8.0 . This is primarily due to an increase in the number of units shipped at the ATG of approximately 3,007,000 and to price increases at the ATG of approximately 1,699,000 and the CPG of approximately 300,000. This is partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shipped at the ATG of approximately 1,198,000 and at the CPG of approximately 427,000 and a decrease in the number of units shipped at the CPG of approximately 118,000. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 80 and 78 , respectively, of the Company s consolidated revenues were derived from the ATG sale of product to a small base of customers. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 20 and 22 , respectively, of the Company s consolidated revenues were derived from the CPG sale of product to a large base of retail customers. Our commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, and increasing market demand could impact our ability to produce and deliver product on time. The ATG engages its business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies. We believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial aircraft market driven by the recovery of business with increased demand post COVID, the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel-efficient alternatives and the increasing demand for air travel in emerging markets. Although the ATG backlog continues to be strong, actual scheduled shipments may be delayed or changed as a function of our customers final delivery determinations. See also Note 10, Business Segments, of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for information concerning business segment operating results.

This benefited from price increases at the ATG of approximately 569,000. Although the ATG is experiencing an increase in volume due to the recovery of business within the commercial aircraft market it is partially offset by an unfavorable product mix of product shipped of approximately 305,000. Additionally, the CPG had an increase in prices of approximately 126,000 offset by by an unfavorable product mix of product shipped and a decrease in the number of units shipped amounting to approximately 513,000 as compared to the same three month period ended December 31, 2021. Consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately 3,263,000 or 8.0 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021. Although the ATG is experiencing an increase in volume due to the recovery of business within the commercial aircraft market of approximately 3,007,000 it is partially offset by an unfavorable product mix of product shipped of approximately 1,198,000. The twelve month period benefited from price increases at the ATG of approximately 1,699,000. Additionally, the CPG had an increase in prices of approximately 300,000 offset by an unfavorable product mix of product shipped and a decrease in the number of units shipped amounting to approximately 545,000 as compared to the same twelve month period ended December 31, 2021. Gross Profit Consolidated gross profit from operations decreased approximately 736,000 for the three month period ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021. The gross profit decreased at the ATG by approximately 1,233,000 offset by an increase at the CPG of approximately 497,000. Gross profit benefited in the three months period from the recovery of business within the commercial aircraft market with increased volume and price increases offset by an unfavorable product mix shipped at the ATG of a net decrease of approximately 270,000 and increased operating costs of approximately 963,000. The increase in operating costs is primarily due to increased compensation and benefits of approximately 906,000 and expendable tools and equipment of approximately 124,000, and a net increase of approximately 9,000 for all other operating expenses, offset by lower warranty expenses of approximately 76,000 as compared to the same period in 2021. The ATG has added staff during this period in anticipation of increasing production in 2023 to satisfy the increasing customer demand.

 Additionally, gross profit increased in the three month period at the CPG due to an improvement in operating variances of approximately 255,000, and a decrease in operating costs of approximately 242,000. The decrease in operating costs is primarily due to an improvement in the utilization of production resources of approximately 235,000, a decrease in freight of approximately 54,000, offset by an increase in utilities of approximately 24,000 and a net increase of approximately 23,000 for all other expenses as compared to the same period in 2021. Consolidated gross profit from operations decreased slightly by approximately 44,000 or (0.7) for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021. The gross profit decreased at the ATG by approximately 1,618,000 and increased at the CPG by approximately 1,574,000. Gross profit benefited in the twelve months period from the recovery of business within the commercial aircraft market and price increases at the ATG of approximately 1,229,000. However, this was more than offset by an unfavorable product mix shipped and an increase in operating costs of approximately 2,847,000. This is primarily due to increased compensation and benefits of approximately 2,234,000, recruiting costs for the ramp-up of production of approximately 188,000, expendable tools and equipment of approximately 178,000, building and production equipment maintenance of approximately 125,000, travel and lodging of approximately 106,000 and a net increase of approximately 16,000 for all other operating expenses as compared to the same period in 2021. As previously noted, we have added staff during this period in the preparation for increased production in 2023 to satisfy customer demand. At the CPG, gross profit increased in the twelve month period due to price increases of approximately 300,000, a decrease in operating variances of approximately 348,000 and a decrease in operating costs of approximately 926,000. The decrease in operating costs is primarily due to an improvement in the utilization of production resources of approximately 417,000, a decrease in net freight costs of approximately 400,000, a decrease in compensation and benefits of approximately 58,000, a decrease in repair and maintenance expenses of approximately 48,000 and a net decrease of approximately 3,000 for all other operating expenses as compared to the same period in 2021. Since mid-2020, both Segments have experienced the challenge of fully utilizing their production resources, increasing the cost per unit produced. In 2022, CPG experienced favorable production costs in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, both Segments have incurred increased costs for raw materials associated with the production of our products. The ATG has incurred the costs of ramping up staffing to support increased production planned for 2023. Despite the challenges, the consolidated gross profit has decreased only slightly from the same period in 2021. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Operating Income (Loss)

Consolidated SG A improved to 21.4 of revenue for the 2022 quarter compared with 23.9 in the 2021 quarter. SG A expenses at the ATG decreased approximately 373,000 or 18.0 . The improvement at the ATG is driven by the lower legal fees of approximately 577,000 offset by increased compensation and benefits of approximately 160,000 due to additional headcount, and increased recruiting costs of approximately 44,000. However, SG A expenses at the CPG increased approximately 84,000 or 18.9 . The increase is due to an increase in compensation and benefits of approximately 38,000 and outbound freight of approximately 50,000, offset by a net decrease of all other SG A expenses of 4,000 as compared to the same period in 2021. Selling, general and administrative (SG A) decreased approximately 2,886,000 or 25.5 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021. Consolidated SG A improved to 19.2 of revenue for 2022 compared with 27.9 in 2021. The improvement is due to a non-recurring legal settlements of approximately 1,890,000 in 2021, as previously disclosed; lower legal fees of approximately 1,255,000 offset by an increase in insurance expenses of approximately 88,000, Directors fees of approximately 54,000, recruiting fees of approximately 40,000 and sales tax expense of approximately 36,000. Additionally, there was a net increase of all other SG A expenses of approximately 41,000 as compared to the same period in 2021. In 2022, the ATG experienced a decrease in SG A as a percentage of revenues. Management expects the ATG SG A percentage to revenue to continue to drop in conjunction with the increase of revenue volume. The CPG SG A percentage to revenue is not expected to improve significantly. Operating Losses Losses from operations increased approximately 447,000 or 38.2 when compared to the same three month period in 2021. Operating losses improved at the CPG by approximately 413,000 as compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2021. However, operating losses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 at the ATG increased by approximately 860,000 as compared to the same time period in 2021, for the reasons previously explanined including investments in staffing to support planned production increases in 2023. Losses from operations decreased approximately 2,842,000 or (53.4 when compared to the same twelve month period in 2021. Operating losses improved significantly at both the ATG and CPG by approximately 1,251,000 and 1,591,000, respectively, as compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021. The consolidated decrease in operating losses is primarily the result in the increases in revenue and decreases in SG A expenditures, as discussed above.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, enacted November 15, 2021 terminated the employee retention credit for wages paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 for employers that are not recovery startup businesses. As a result, for the three month period ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, there was no recognition of an ERC. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 there was no recognition of an ERC as compared to approximately 5,622,000 recognized in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, as discussed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company executed a promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP loan) in the amount of 4,000,000. During the third quarter of 2021, the entire loan in the amount of 4,000,000 and accrued interest of 57,000 was forgiven by the Small Business Association (SBA) and a gain of 4,057,000 was recorded in Other (expense)/income in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased approximately 9,000 or (16.4 primarily due to the reimbursement of the line of credit and equipment financing lease obligations at the ATG for the three month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 interest expense increased approximately 53,000 or 28.3 primarily due to the increase in interest recognized for postretirement benefits offset by the elimination of the interest resulting from the pay down of our term loans as of December 31, 2021.

 (Loss)/Income before Income Taxes Consolidated loss before income taxes for the three month period ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately 330,000 (25.0 when compare to the same period in 2021. The consolidated decrease is primarily the result of an increase in ATG revenue, improved operating performance at the CPG and lower SG A expenses at the ATG offset by a decrease in CPG revenue, a decrease in operating performance at the ATG, investments in ATG production staffing to support 2023 volume demand and an increase in SG A expenses at the CPG as discussed above. The consolidated loss before income taxes for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately 6,699,000 or 167.0 when compared to the same period ended in 2021. The consolidated loss increased primarily due to the elimination of the ERC credit and the one-time event of the PPP loan forgiveness offset by an increase in revenue at the ATG segment, an improvement in operating performance at the CPG, decreases in SG A expenses at both segments and decreases for 2021 legal awards as discussed above. Income Taxes The Company s effective tax rate for operations was 21.2 in 2022 and (1.1) in 2021. The effective tax rate reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, 2021 non-taxable PPP loan foregiveness income, the 2021 deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) , and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. The increase in the effective tax rate between 2022 and 2021 is primarily a result of the non-taxable PPP loan forgiveness income recognized in 2021.

 The decrease in cash flow from operating activities of approximately 4,327,000 is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of approximately 6,172,000 as explained previously. In addition, there was a decrease in cash flow due to an increase in accounts receivable, accrued employee compensation costs, and other accrued liabilities of approximately 4,020,000 and lower generation of cash through changes in inventory of approximately 1,680,000 offset by an increase in cash flow from the adjustments to reconcile net income of approximately 2,790,000, an increase accounts payable of approximately 3,398,000 and all other operating accounts of approximately 1,357,000. Our cash flow from operations and available line of credit capacity provides us with the financial resources needed to run our operations and reinvest in our business. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results. Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, our ability to obtain financing, and our operations in the future. Investing Activities: The Company used approximately 1,281,000 in cash from investing activities during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 as compared to generating cash of approximately 3,000 during the same period in 2021. The investing activities were primarily related to ATG projects and facilities improvements. Financing Activities: The Company s primary usage of cash in its financing activities in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 includes the repayment of our line of credit of approximately 4,250,000 and the principal payment on equipment financing obligations of approximately 275,000. On January 11, 2022, the Company executed an amendment, which extended the line of credit LOC availability period from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. The amended agreement suspended the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant up through and including the third quarter of 2022. A Quarterly Minimum Cash Flow measurement loan covenant replaced the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant. Minimum Cash Flow means net income, plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, plus interest expense, plus non-cash expense related to the Servotronics, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, plus non-cash stock and stock option transactions. Also, the amended agreement required the Company to maintain a minimum liquidity, defined as cash on hand plus LOC availability, of at least 9,000,000. As disclosed in the filing of our 2022 third quarter 10-Q, at that time we anticipated that we would fail to meet the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant up through and including the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we were not in compliance with this covenant under our loan agreement and, as a result, the availability of the LOC was temporarily frozen. On March 30, 2023, we executed an amendment to the loan agreement (the Amendment ), which provides a waiver of Debt Service Coverage Ratio defaults and other potential defaults at December 31, 2022 and through December 31, 2023, the expiration date of the agreement. The Amendment also provides the following stipulations. The LOC loan was immediately converted to a borrowing base line of credit utilizing eligible accounts receivable (the Borrowing Base ), with a maximum availability of the lesser of 5,000,000 or the Borrowing Base, which amounted to 6,400,000 as of the amendment date. As of June 29, 2023, the maximum availability under the Borrowing Base LOC will be reduced to the lesser of 3,900,000 or the Borrowing Base; and then as of August 1, 2023, it will be further reduced to the lesser of 1,000,000 or the Borrowing Base. The amended Borrowing Base LOC loan is secured by all equipment, receivables, inventory and real property of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Ontario Knife Company, with the exception of certain equipment that was purchased from proceeds of government grants. Interest on the Borrowing Base LOC is the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield BSBY plus 4.00 percentage points, amounting to 8.88 as of March 30, 2023. Pursuant to the Amendment, we paid in full the outstanding balance on our equipment loans, approximately 501,000 as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, we advanced 500,000 on the Borrowing Base LOC loan for a pledged deposit account with our lender to be used solely to pay interest.

 We intend to refinance the LOC loan with a different lender by June 29, 2023. Failure to deliver a commitment letter to our current lender by June 1, 2023 and to refinance the LOC loan by June 29, 2023 will result in the imposition of additional fees to our current lender of up to 300,000. Ongoing Liquidity Considerations We incurred consolidated operating losses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The losses incurred were predominantly driven by our decision to maintain our experienced and knowledgeable workforce during the pandemic years and hire ahead of the expected increased customer demand at the ATG. During 2021, our operating losses were funded by PPP loans and Employee Retention Credits provided by the U.S. government, which were not available in 2022. Our operating losses decreased year over year by 53 , demonstrating positive momentum. We had total shareholders equity of approximately 35,112,000 as of December 31, 2022. Also, as of that date, we had working capital excluding cash of approximately 23,041,000 and only 501,000 of bank financing. The ATG has experienced growing customer demand since the middle of 2022, causing an increase in inventory purchases and the resulting usage of cash. This was further exacerbated by the hiring and training of staff to support increasing production in 2023. The temporary freezing of availability on our LOC raised initial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern until we amended our loan agreement on March 30, 2023, alleviating that doubt. We believe that our operating cash flow and availability of our amended Borrowing Base LOC provides us with sufficient liquidity in the near term. Additionally, we are actively pursuing an alternate credit facility with a different lender to replace the Borrowing Base LOC loan from our current lender by June 29, 2023. We believe that the strength of our asset base and increasing customer demand make our ability to successfully refinance our LOC probable, providing us with sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Not applicable. Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As such, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified our critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical where (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Inventories Inventories are measured at lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory costing requires complex calculations that include standard labor and material costs, assumptions for overhead absorption, scrap, and the determination of which costs may be capitalized. Analysis of actual labor cost to standard cost is performed and adjusted, if required, quarterly. Material costs are assessed and adjusted on an on-going basis. Daily cycle counts of raw material and finished goods are performed to ensure accuracy and legitimacy of its inventory balances. Quarterly, full physical counts are performed for WIP balances. The valuation of inventory requires us to review inventory each quarter for excess and slow-moving items and establish a reserve. As of December 31, 2022, we have 19,044 of inventory recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, representing approximately 42 of total assets.

 Impairment The Company tests for impairment of long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flow analyses. These calculations require the use of estimates, in particular in relation to the expected growth of sales, the expected hourly rate for labor, the expected productivity of the production labor and achievable gross margin rates. Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance The Company makes estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Recovery of a deferred tax asset is based on the ability of the business to generate income. If recovery, is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. These calculations require the use of estimates, in particular in relation to the expected growth of sales, the expected hourly rate for labor, the expected productivity of the production labor and achievable gross margin rates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is a smaller reporting company by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The consolidated financial statements of the Company which are included in this Form 10-K Annual Report are described in the accompanying Index to Consolidated Financial Statements on Page F1. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (i) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation as of December 31, 2022, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. (ii) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, the Company, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (COSO) . The Company s management noted the following control deficiencies that, in the aggregate, constitute a material weakness in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022: Management s assessment of the documentation of controls surrounding significant estimates.

 o While management does have controls around the completeness and accuracy of system-generated reports used in process level controls, the documentation of such controls needs to be improved to substantiate such controls. Management should also improve the procedures performed to substantiate relevant data points from those reports that are relied upon. 
 Notwithstanding the existence of the above-mentioned material weakness, the Company believes that the consolidated financial statements in this filing fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of December 31, 2022. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Corporation to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (iii) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. Management previously identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in connection with the 2020 Form 10-K/A and 2021 Form 10-K filings. Remediation efforts for the identified material weaknesses began in 2021 and concluded successfully in 2022 for the following: Failure to complete the design and implement effective internal controls related to certain information technology (IT) general controls including: establishing written IT policies, performing a formal IT risk assessment, establishing offsite backup, and monitoring logical access and change management. Remediation efforts included: engaged a third party to perform a comprehensive information technology (IT) general controls assessment by: 
 o performing a formal IT risk assessment, o performing file restores from backup at least annually, o annual security awareness training and frequent phishing campaigns to test the knowledge of employees, and o monitoring logical access and change management. 
 Management s assessment of entity-level controls and certain control activities are not sufficiently performed and documented to support our conclusions and as a result, we concluded that management s oversight of internal controls was not operating effectively. Remediation efforts included: engaged a third party to assist with enhanced internal control testing procedures and documentation standards aligned with the COSO components and principles, including entity-level controls. 
 In order to fully remediate the material weakness identified above that remains in 2022, we will continue to improve on our documentation to support our conclusions for critical estimates and enhance our documentation to validate the completeness and accuracy of system reports.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Servotronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Servotronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income, and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Inventories As discussed in Note 1, and as presented in Note 2 to the financial statements, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs include all costs incurred to bring each product to its present location and condition. Market provisions in respect of lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments and inventory determined to be slow moving are applied to the gross inventory through a reserve. 
 - F2 - 

Table of Contents 
 The determination of the reserve for slow-moving and obsolete inventories always requires subjective assumptions related to expectations for future market conditions, customer forecasted orders, and product demand. The impact of COVID-19 on the general economy, and specifically the commercial aerospace industry, continued to adversely impact the Company for fiscal year 2022. This included delays and declines in customer orders and revenue recognized, as well as continued high levels of inventories. Factors involved in accounting for inventories include verification of existence, determination of cost, and evaluation of reserves. Due to the magnitude of the inventories and various complex matters and subjective assumptions, we identified inventories as a critical audit matter, which required a high degree of auditor judgement. Addressing the matter involved performing subjective procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. The primary procedures we performed included, obtaining an understanding of the process and assumptions used by management related to the accounting for inventories; evaluating management s physical count procedures; performing our own test count procedures; testing management s calculations related to costing of products; and testing management s determination of the reserves. These procedures include testing the completeness and accuracy of the source data used, testing the mathematical accuracy of management s calculations, evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of the methodology and assumptions applied by management based on current factors, and performing a retrospective review of the prior-year estimates used to identify potential bias of management judgements. Impairment tests of long-lived assets As discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on the fair value of the assets. Due to the losses incurred, the Company performed a test for recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing its carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the asset group. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows can impact the determination of whether an impairment exists, which could materially impact the financial statements. Due to the subjectivity involved we identified the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and test of impairment as a critical audit matter, which required a higher degree of auditor judgement. Addressing the matter involved performing subjective procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. The primary procedures we performed include: obtaining an understanding of the process and assumptions used by management related to the impairment consideration, obtaining and reviewing management s impairment analysis; assessing the completeness and accuracy of those assets identified in the asset group; identifying key inputs and assumptions used by management to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated; testing the mathematical accuracy of management s calculations and reviewing assumptions for reasonableness. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2005. March 31, 2023

 On January 11, 2022, the Company executed an amendment, which extended the line of credit LOC availability period from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. The amended agreement suspended the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant up through and including the third quarter of 2022. A Quarterly Minimum Cash Flow measurement loan covenant replaced the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant. Minimum Cash Flow means net income, plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, plus interest expense, plus non-cash expense related to the Servotronics, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, plus non-cash stock and stock option transactions. Also, the amended agreement required the Company to maintain a minimum liquidity, defined as cash on hand plus LOC availability, of at least . As disclosed in the filing of our 2022 third quarter 10-Q, at that time the Company anticipated that we would fail to meet the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant up through and including the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was not in compliance with this covenant under our loan agreement and, as a result, the availability of the LOC was temporarily frozen. On March 30, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the loan agreement (the Amendment ), which provides a waiver of Debt Service Coverage Ratio defaults and other potential defaults at December 31, 2022 and through December 31, 2023, the expiration date of the agreement.

 or the Borrowing Base, which amounted to as of the amendment date. As of June 29, 2023, the maximum availability under the Borrowing Base LOC will be reduced to the lesser of or the Borrowing Base; and then as of August 1, 2023, it will be further reduced to the lesser of or the Borrowing Base. The amended Borrowing Base LOC loan is secured by all equipment, receivables, inventory and real property of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Ontario Knife Company, with the exception of certain equipment that was purchased from proceeds of government grants. Interest on the Borrowing Base LOC is the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield BSBY plus percentage points, amounting to as of March 30, 2023. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company paid in full the outstanding balance on our equipment loans, approximately as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company advanced on the Borrowing Base LOC loan for a pledged deposit account with our lender to be used solely to pay interest. The Company intends to refinance the LOC loan with a different lender by June 29, 2023. Failure to deliver a commitment letter to our current lender by June 1, 2023 and to refinance the LOC loan by June 29, 2023 will result in the imposition of additional fees to our current lender of up to . Ongoing Liquidity Considerations The Company incurred consolidated operating losses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The losses incurred were predominantly driven by our decision to maintain our experienced and knowledgeable workforce during the pandemic years and hire ahead of the expected increased customer demand at the ATG. During 2021, the Company s operating losses were funded by PPP loans and Employee Retention Credits provided by the U.S. government, which were not available in 2022. The Company s operating losses decreased year over year by , demonstrating positive momentum. The Company s total shareholders equity was approximately as of December 31, 2022. Also, as of that date, the Company had working capital excluding cash of approximately and only of bank financing. The ATG has experienced growing customer demand since the middle of 2022, causing an increase in inventory purchases and the resulting usage of cash. This was further exacerbated by the hiring and training of staff to support increasing production in 2023. The temporary freezing of availability on our LOC raised initial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern until the Company amended the loan agreement on March 30, 2023, alleviating that doubt. We believe that our operating cash flow and availability of our amended Borrowing Base LOC provides us with sufficient liquidity in the near term. Additionally, the Company is actively pursuing an alternate credit facility with a different lender to replace the Borrowing Base LOC loan from our current lender by June 29, 2023. We believe that the strength of our asset base and increasing customer demand make our ability to successfully refinance our LOC probable, providing the Company with sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months.

Our board of directors has the authority to divide any or all of the shares of Preferred Stock into, and to authorize the issuance of, one or more series of Preferred Stock. Before issuance of shares of each series, our board of directors is required to fix for each such series, subject to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation, the powers, designations, preferences and other special rights of such series, including such provisions as may be desired concerning voting, redemption, dividends, dissolution or the distribution of assets, conversion or exchange, and such other matters as may be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.

Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and the DGCL operate with respect to extraordinary corporate transactions, such as mergers, reorganizations, tender offers, sales or transfers of substantially all of our assets or our liquidation of the Company, and could have the effect of delaying or making more difficult a change in control of our company in certain circumstances.

The Rights initially trade together with the Common Stock and are not exercisable. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Rights will separate from the common stock and become exercisable following (i) the date of the Company s public announcement or filing that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, which is defined as a person who has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 25 or more of the Common Stock then outstanding, subject to certain exceptions, or (ii) the tenth calendar day after any person or group commences a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person.

We have also obtained policies of directors and officers liability insurance. These policies insure our directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment under certain circumstances. The existence of such indemnification and insurance may impede a change of control of us to the extent that a hostile acquirer seeks to litigate its contest for control with our directors and officers.
