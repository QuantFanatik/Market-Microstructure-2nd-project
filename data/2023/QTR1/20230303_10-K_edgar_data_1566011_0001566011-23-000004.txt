PBF Holding Refineries 
 Our six refineries are located in Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, Toledo, Ohio, Chalmette, Louisiana, Torrance, California and Martinez, California. In 2020, we reconfigured our Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries (the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration ), temporarily idling certain of our major processing units at the Paulsboro refinery, in order to operate the two refineries as one functional unit that we refer to as the East Coast Refining System . Each refinery is briefly described in the table below: 
 Refinery Region Nelson Complexity Index (1) 
 Throughput Capacity (in barrels per day) (1) 
 PADD Crude Processed (2) 
 Source (2) 
 Delaware City East Coast 13.6 180,000 1 light sweet through heavy sour water, rail Paulsboro East Coast 8.8 (3) 
 155,000 (3) 
 1 light sweet through heavy sour water Toledo Mid-Continent 11.0 180,000 2 light sweet pipeline, truck, rail Chalmette Gulf Coast 13.0 185,000 3 light sweet through heavy sour water, pipeline Torrance West Coast 13.8 166,000 5 medium and heavy pipeline, water, truck Martinez West Coast 16.1 157,000 5 medium and heavy pipeline and water 
 ________ 
 (1) Reflects operating conditions at each refinery as of the date of this filing. Changes in complexity and throughput capacity reflect the result of current market conditions, in addition to investments made to improve our facilities and maintain compliance with environmental and governmental regulations. Configurations at each of our refineries are regularly evaluated and accordingly updated, which resulted in the restart of several idled processing units at the Paulsboro refinery in 2022. 
 (2) Reflects the typical crude and feedstocks and related sources utilized under normal operating conditions and prevailing market environments. 
 (3) Under normal operating conditions and prevailing market environments, our Nelson Complexity Index and throughput capacity for the Paulsboro refinery would be 13.1 and 180,000, respectively. As a result of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration and subsequent restart of several idled processing units at the Paulsboro refinery, our Nelson Complexity Index and throughput capacity were reduced. 
 PBF Logistics LP Transactions

Inventory Intermediation Agreement. On October 25, 2021, we entered into a third amended and restated inventory intermediation agreement with J. Aron, (the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement ), to support the operations of the Delaware City, Paulsboro and Chalmette refineries (collectively, the PBF Entities ). The Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement expires on December 31, 2024, which term may be further extended by mutual consent of the parties to December 31, 2025. 
 Pursuant to the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron purchases and holds title to certain inventory, including crude oil, intermediate and certain finished products (the J. Aron Products ), purchased or produced by the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries (and, at the election of the PBF Entities, the Chalmette refinery) (the "Refineries") and delivered into our storage tanks at the Refineries (the Storage Tanks ). The J. Aron Products are sold back to us as the J. Aron Products are discharged out of our Storage Tanks. At expiration or termination of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement, we will have to repurchase the inventories outstanding under the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement at that time. 
 Tankage Capacity. The Delaware City refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 10.0 million barrels. Of the total, approximately 3.6 million barrels of storage capacity are dedicated to crude oil and other feedstock storage with the remaining 6.4 million barrels allocated to finished products, intermediates and other products. The Paulsboro refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 7.5 million barrels. Of the total, approximately 2.1 million barrels are dedicated to crude oil storage with the remaining 5.4 million barrels allocated to finished products, intermediates and other products. 
 Energy and Other Utilities. Under normal operating conditions, the Delaware City refinery consumes approximately 75,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Delaware City refinery has a 280 MW power plant located on site that consists of two natural gas-fueled turbines with combined capacity of approximately 140 MW and four turbo generators with combined nameplate capacity of approximately 140 MW. Collectively, this power plant produces electricity in excess of Delaware City s refinery load of approximately 90 MW. Excess electricity is sold into the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland, or PJM, grid. Steam is primarily produced by a combination of three dedicated boilers, two heat recovery steam generators on the gas turbines, and is supplemented by secondary boilers at the FCC and Coker. Hydrogen is currently provided via the refinery s steam methane reformer and continuous catalytic reformer. 
 Under normal operating conditions, the Paulsboro refinery currently consumes approximately 40,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Paulsboro refinery is mostly self-sufficient for electrical power through a mix of gas and steam turbine generators. The Paulsboro refinery generation supplies all of the 20MW total refinery load. There are circumstances where available generation is greater than the total refinery load, and the Paulsboro refinery can export up to about 40MW of power to the utility grid if warranted. If necessary, supplemental electrical power is available on a guaranteed basis from the local utility. The Paulsboro refinery is connected to the grid via three separate 69KV aerial feeders and has the ability to run entirely on imported power. Steam is produced in three boilers and a heat recovery steam generator fed by the exhaust from the gas turbine. In addition, there are a number of waste heat boilers and furnace stack economizers throughout the refinery that supplement the steam generation capacity. The Paulsboro refinery s hydrogen needs are met by the steam methane reformer and the catalytic reformer.

Agreements with PBFX 
 Beginning with the completion of the PBFX Offering, we have entered into a series of agreements with PBFX, including commercial and operational agreements. Each of these agreements and their impact to our operations is outlined below. 
 Contribution Agreements 
 Immediately prior to the closing of certain contribution agreements, which PBF LLC entered into with PBFX (as defined in the table below, and collectively referred to as the Contribution Agreements ), we contributed certain assets to PBF LLC. PBF LLC in turn contributed those assets to PBFX pursuant to the Contribution Agreements. Certain proceeds received by PBF LLC from PBFX in accordance with the Contribution Agreements were subsequently contributed by PBF LLC to us. The Contribution Agreements include the following: 
 Contribution Agreement Effective Date Assets Contributed Total Consideration Contribution Agreement I 5/8/2014 DCR Rail Terminal and the Toledo Truck Terminal 74,053 PBFX common units and 15,886,553 PBFX subordinated units Contribution Agreement II 9/16/2014 DCR West Rack 135.0 million in cash and 15.0 million through the issuance of 589,536 PBFX common units Contribution Agreement III 12/2/2014 Toledo Storage Facility 135.0 million in cash and 15.0 million through the issuance of 620,935 PBFX common units Contribution Agreement IV 5/5/2015 DCR Products Pipeline and DCR Truck Rack 112.5 million in cash and 30.5 million through the issuance of 1,288,420 PBFX common units Contribution Agreement V 8/31/2016 Torrance Valley Pipeline (50 equity interest in TVPC) 175.0 million in cash Contribution Agreement VI 2/15/2017 Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline 11.6 million affiliate promissory note Contribution Agreements VII-X 7/16/2018 Development Assets 31.6 million through the issuance of 1,494,134 PBFX common units Contribution Agreement XI 4/24/2019 Remaining 50 equity interest in TVPC 200.0 million in cash 
 Commercial Agreements 
 PBFX currently derives the majority of its revenue from long-term, fee-based agreements with us, which generally include a minimum volume commitment MVC ), as applicable, and are supported by contractual fee escalations for inflation adjustments and certain increases in operating costs. We believe the terms and conditions under these agreements, as well as the Omnibus Agreement and the Services Agreement (each as defined below), each with PBFX, are generally no less favorable to either party than those that could have been negotiated with unaffiliated parties with respect to similar services. 
 Refer to Note 10 - Related Party Transactions of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the commercial agreements with PBFX. 
 19 

Omnibus Agreement 
 In addition to the commercial agreements described above, PBFX entered into an omnibus agreement, which has been amended and restated in connection with the closing of certain of the Contribution Agreements with PBF GP, PBF LLC and us (as amended, the Omnibus Agreement ). The Omnibus Agreement addresses the payment of an annual fee for the provision of various general and administrative services and reimbursement of salary and benefit costs for certain PBF Energy employees. 
 The annual fee under the Omnibus Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 8.3 million, inclusive of obligations under the Omnibus Agreement to reimburse us for certain compensation and benefit costs of employees who devoted more than 50 of their time to PBFX during the year ended December 31, 2022. We currently estimate to receive 8.3 million, inclusive of estimated obligations under the Omnibus Agreement as a reimbursement for certain compensation and benefit costs of employees who devote more than 50 of their time to PBFX for the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 Services Agreement 
 Additionally, PBFX entered into an operation and management services and secondment agreement with us and certain of our subsidiaries (as amended, the Services Agreement ), pursuant to which we provide PBFX with the personnel necessary for PBFX to perform its obligations under its commercial agreements. PBFX reimburses us for the use of such employees and the provision of certain infrastructure-related services to the extent applicable to its operations, including storm water discharge and waste water treatment, steam, potable water, access to certain roads and grounds, sanitary sewer access, electrical power, emergency response, filter press, fuel gas, API solids treatment, fire water and compressed air. For the year ended December 31, 2022, PBFX paid us an annual fee of 8.7 million pursuant to the Services Agreement and we currently estimate to receive the same annual reimbursement pursuant to the Services Agreement for the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 On February 13, 2019, we amended the existing Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement, by and between Delaware City Terminaling Company LLC DCTC and us (as amended effective January 1, 2019, the Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement for the inclusion of services through certain rail infrastructure (the East Coast Rail Assets at the assets acquired in connection with the PBFX acquisition of CPI Operations LLC (the East Coast Storage Assets ). We also entered into a new Terminaling Services Agreement, by and between DCTC and us, with a four-year term starting on January 1, 2022, subsequent to the expiration of the Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement, related to the DCR Rail Facilities and the East Coast Rail Assets, which reduced the MVC to 95,000 bpd and includes additional services to be provided by PBFX as operator of facilities owned by our subsidiaries. 
 The Services Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Omnibus Agreement, provided that PBFX may terminate any service on 30-days notice. 
 Principal Products 
 Our refineries make various grades of gasoline, distillates (including diesel fuel, jet fuel, and ULSD) and other products from crude oil, other feedstocks, and blending components. We sell these products through our commercial accounts, and sales with major oil companies. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, gasoline and distillates accounted for 88.6 , 86.4 and 85.1 of our revenues, respectively. 
 20 

Customers 
 We sell a variety of refined products to a diverse customer base. The majority of our refined products are primarily sold through short-term contracts or on the spot market. In addition, we have product offtake arrangements for a portion of our clean products. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 only one customer, Shell plc Shell ), accounted for 10 or more of our revenues (approximately 14 and 15 , respectively). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, only one customer, Shell, accounted for 10 or more of our total trade accounts receivable (approximately 19 and 26 , respectively). 
 Seasonality 
 Traditionally, demand for gasoline and diesel is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. Decreased demand during the winter months can lower gasoline and diesel prices. However, due to global supply disruptions, the effects of seasonality on our operating results have been less impactful in 2022 and 2021. 
 Competition 
 The refining business is very competitive. We compete directly with various other refining companies on the East, Gulf and West Coasts and in the Mid-Continent, with integrated oil companies, with foreign refiners that import products into the United States and with producers and marketers in other industries supplying alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Some of our competitors have expanded the capacity of their refineries and internationally new refineries are coming on line which could also affect our competitive position. 
 Profitability in the refining industry depends largely on refined product margins, which can fluctuate significantly, as well as crude oil prices and differentials between the prices of different grades of crude oil, operating efficiency and reliability, product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation. Certain of our competitors that have larger and more complex refineries may be able to realize lower per-barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of feedstocks or intense price fluctuations. Refining margins are frequently impacted by sharp changes in crude oil costs, which may not be immediately reflected in product prices. 
 The refining industry is highly competitive with respect to feedstock supply. Unlike certain of our competitors that have access to proprietary controlled sources of crude oil production available for use at their own refineries, we obtain all of our crude oil and substantially all other feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. The availability and cost of crude oil and feedstock are affected by global supply and demand. We have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil. We believe, however, that we will be able to obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at generally competitive prices for the foreseeable future. 
 Pursuant to its RFS, EPA has implemented mandates to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels produced and sold in the United States. However, unlike certain of our competitors, we currently do not produce renewable fuels, and increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into our products displaces an increasing volume of our refineries product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and profitability. In addition, in order to meet certain of these and future EPA requirements, we may be required to continue to purchase RINs, which historically had, and we expect to have, fluctuating costs based on market conditions. 
 21

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 Our refineries, pipelines and related operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment, waste management and the characteristics and the compositions of fuels. Compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations can increase the overall cost of operating the refineries, including remediation, operating costs and capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. Permits are also required under these laws for the operation of our refineries, pipelines and related operations and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits will continue to have an impact on our operations, results of operations and capital requirements. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws, regulations and permits. 
 We incorporate by reference into this Item the environmental disclosures contained in the following sections of this report: 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our results of operations continue to be impacted by significant costs to comply with renewable fuels mandates. The market prices for RINs have been volatile and may harm our profitability;

Applicable Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
 As is the case with all companies engaged in industries similar to ours, we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental and safety matters. These matters include soil and water contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed of. 
 Current and future environmental regulations are expected to require additional expenditures, including expenditures for investigation and remediation, which may be significant, at our refineries and at our other facilities. To the extent that future expenditures for these purposes are material and can be reasonably determined, these costs are disclosed and accrued. 
 Our operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. 
 We cannot predict what additional health, safety and environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing requirements or discovery of new information such as unknown contamination could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment that we do not currently possess. 
 We incorporate by reference into this Item the federal and state regulatory requirements disclosures contained in the following sections of this report:

Risk Factors 
 You should carefully read the risks and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. 
 Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry 
 Demand for our refined products can significantly decline due to changes in global and regional economic conditions. 
 Business closings and layoffs in the markets we operate may adversely affect demand for our refined products. Deterioration of general economic conditions or weak demand levels could require additional actions on our part to lower our operating costs, including temporarily or permanently ceasing to operate units at our facilities, as experienced in 2020 when certain assets were temporarily idled as part of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration. There may be significant incremental costs associated with such actions. Deterioration of global and regional economic conditions may harm our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt. 
 The price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, cash flows and liquidity. 
 Our profitability, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil, intermediate partially refined products, and natural gas liquids that are processed and blended into refined products) at which we are able to sell refined products. Refining is primarily a margin-based business and, to increase profitability, it is important to maximize the yields of high value finished products while minimizing the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs contracts, our earnings, profitability and cash flows are negatively affected. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, as a result of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services. An increase or decrease in the price of crude oil will likely result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products; however, there may be a time lag in the realization, or no such realization, of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on our refining margins therefore depends in part on how quickly and how fully refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes. 
 The nature of our business has required us to maintain substantial crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories. Because crude oil, feedstock and refined products are commodities, we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories. Our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last-in-first-out LIFO inventory valuation methodology. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the replacement value of inventories exceeded the LIFO carrying value, therefore no LCM inventory reserve was recorded. If the market value of our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventory declines to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash impact to cost of products and other. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which decreased income from operations and net income by 268.0 million. 
 Prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, ethanol, asphalt and other refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by a variety of economic, market, environmental and political conditions. 
 27 

Our direct operating expense structure also impacts our profitability. Our major direct operating expenses include employee and contract labor, maintenance and energy. Our predominant variable direct operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of fuel and other utility services. The volatility in costs of fuel, principally natural gas, and other utility services, principally electricity, used by our refineries and other operations affect our operating costs. Fuel and utility prices have been, and will continue to be, affected by factors outside our control, such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets. Natural gas prices have historically been volatile and, typically, electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices. Future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our refining margins, profitability and cash flows. 
 Our working capital, cash flows and liquidity can be significantly impacted by volatility in commodity prices and refined product demand. 
 Payment terms for our crude oil purchases are typically longer than those terms we extend to our customers for sales of refined products. Additionally, reductions in crude oil purchases tend to lag demand decreases for our refined products. As a result of this timing differential, the payables for our crude oil purchases are generally proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales. As we are normally in a net payables position, a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital. Given we process a significant volume of crude oil, the impact can materially affect our working capital, cash flows and liquidity. 
 Our profitability is affected by crude oil differentials and related factors, which fluctuate substantially. 
 A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been less expensive than benchmark crude oils, such as the heavy, sour crude oils processed at our Delaware City, Paulsboro, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries. For our Toledo refinery, aside from recent crude differential volatility, purchased crude prices have historically been above the WTI benchmark, however, such crude slate typically results in favorable refinery production yield. For all locations, these crude oil differentials can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products. Any change in these crude oil differentials may have an impact on our earnings. Our rail investment and strategy to acquire cost advantaged Mid-Continent and Canadian crude, which are priced based on WTI, could be adversely affected when the WTI/Dated Brent or related differentials narrow. A narrowing of the WTI/Dated Brent differential may result in our Toledo refinery losing a portion of its crude oil price advantage over certain of our competitors, which negatively impacts our profitability. In addition, efforts in Canada to control the imbalance between its production and capacity to export crude may continue to result in price volatility and the narrowing of the WTI/WCS differential, which is a proxy for the difference between light U.S. and heavy Canadian crude oil, and may reduce our refining margins and adversely affect our profitability and earnings. Divergent views have been expressed as to the expected magnitude of changes to these crude differentials in future periods. Any continued or further narrowing of these differentials could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. 
 Additionally, governmental and regulatory actions, including continued resolutions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict crude oil production levels and executive actions by the current U.S. presidential administration to restrict the advancement of certain energy infrastructure projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline or Enbridge s Line 5 pipeline, may continue to impact crude oil prices and crude oil differentials. Any increase in crude oil prices or unfavorable movements in crude oil differentials due to such actions or changing regulatory environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire crude oil at economical prices and could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. 
 28 

A significant interruption or casualty loss at any of our refineries and related assets could reduce our production, particularly if not fully covered by our insurance. Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results and financial condition. 
 Our business currently consists of owning and operating six refineries and related assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if any of our refineries were to experience a major accident, be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster, or otherwise be forced to shut down or curtail production due to unforeseen events, such as acts of God, nature, orders of governmental authorities, supply chain disruptions impacting our crude rail facilities or other logistics assets, power outages, acts of terrorism, fires, toxic emissions and maritime hazards. Any such shutdown or disruption would reduce the production from that refinery. There is also risk of mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns both in general and following unforeseen events. Further, in such situations, undamaged refinery processing units may be dependent on or interact with damaged sections of our refineries and, accordingly, are also subject to being shut down. In the event any of our refineries is forced to shut down for a significant period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our earnings, our other results of operations and our financial condition as a whole. 
 As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities, including claims against us by third parties relating to our operations and products. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage can be limited, and coverage for terrorism risks can include broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 
 Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies and, therefore, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. Even where we have insurance in place, there can be no assurance that the carriers will honor their obligations under the policies. 
 Our refineries are subject to interruptions of supply and distribution, including due to severe weather events, as a result of our reliance on pipelines and railroads for transportation of crude oil and refined products. 
 Our Toledo, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries receive a significant portion of their crude oil through our owned, as well as third party, pipelines. These pipelines include the Enbridge system, Capline and Mid-Valley pipelines for supplying crude to our Toledo refinery, the MOEM Pipeline (which is owned by PBFX) and CAM Pipeline for supplying crude to our Chalmette refinery and the San Joaquin Pipeline, San Pablo Bay Pipeline, San Ardo and Coastal Pipeline systems for supplying crude to our Torrance and Martinez refineries. Additionally, our Toledo, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries deliver a significant portion of the refined products through pipelines. These pipelines include pipelines such as the Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and Buckeye Partners L.P. pipelines at the Toledo refinery, the Collins pipeline (which is owned by PBFX) at our Chalmette refinery, the Jet Pipeline to the Los Angeles International Airport, the Product Pipeline to Vernon and the Product Pipeline to Atwood at our Torrance refinery and the KinderMorgan SFPP North Pipeline at our Martinez refinery. We could experience an interruption of supply or delivery, or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market, if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, weather interruptions, governmental regulation, terrorism, other third-party action or casualty or other events. 
 29 

The Delaware City rail unloading facilities and the East Coast Storage Assets allow our East Coast Refining System to source WTI-based crudes from Western Canada and the Mid-Continent, which may provide significant cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based international crudes in certain market environments. Any disruptions or restrictions to our supply of crude by rail due to problems with third-party logistics infrastructure or operations or as a result of increased regulations, could increase our crude costs and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Due to the common carrier regulatory obligation applicable to interstate oil pipelines, capacity allocation among shippers can become contentious in the event demand is in excess of capacity. Therefore, nominations by new shippers or increased nominations by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for transportation of crude oil and refined products could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, substantial weather-related conditions could impact our relationships and arrangements with our major customers and suppliers by materially affecting the normal flow of crude oil and refined products, especially seaborne transactions. For example, severe weather events could damage transportation infrastructures and lead to interruptions of our operations, including our ability to deliver our products, or increases in costs to receive crude oil. 
 Our results of operations continue to be impacted by significant costs to comply with renewable fuels mandates. The market prices for RINs have been volatile and may harm our profitability. 
 Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, EPA has issued the RFS, implementing mandates to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels produced and sold in the United States. Under the RFS, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated refineries must blend into their finished petroleum fuels historically has increased on an annual basis. In addition, certain states have passed legislation that requires minimum biodiesel blending in finished distillates. On October 13, 2010, EPA raised the maximum amount of ethanol allowed under federal law from 10 to 15 for cars and light trucks manufactured since 2007. The maximum amount allowed under federal law currently remains at 10 ethanol for all other vehicles. Existing laws and regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels may increase. Because we do not currently produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into our products displaces an increasing volume of our refinery s product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and profitability. In addition, in order to meet certain of these and future EPA requirements, we may be required to purchase RINs, which may have fluctuating costs based on market conditions. The price of RINS was significant in 2022 and could increase further in 2023. We incurred approximately 1,225.5 million in RINs costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 726.0 million and 326.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fluctuations in our RINs costs are due primarily to volatility in prices for ethanol-linked RINs and increases in our production of on-road transportation fuels since 2012. Our RINs purchase obligation is dependent on our actual shipment of on-road transportation fuels domestically and the amount of blending achieved which can cause variability in our profitability. On June 3, 2022, EPA finalized the volumes of renewable fuels that obligated refineries must blend into their final petroleum fuels for years 2020, 2021, and 2022. On December 1, 2022, EPA proposed volume requirements and percentage standards under the RFS program for 2023, 2024, and 2025, as well as making a series of important modifications to strengthen and expand the RFS program. As a result, we could also experience fluctuating compliance costs in the future if the volumes finalized by EPA differ from what has been proposed.

We may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. 
 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or our future debt obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, including acquisitions, in which case our operations may not perform as we currently expect. We have substantial short-term capital needs and may have substantial long-term capital needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to financing certain of our crude oil and refined products inventory not covered by our various supply agreements and the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement. 
 If we cannot adequately handle our crude oil and feedstock requirements or if we are required to obtain our crude oil supply at our other refineries without the benefit of the existing supply arrangements or the applicable counterparty defaults in its obligations, our crude oil pricing costs may increase as the number of days between when we pay for the crude oil and when the crude oil is delivered to us increases. Termination of our Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron, which is currently scheduled to expire in 2024, would require us to finance the J. Aron Products covered by the agreement, which financing may not be available at terms that are as favorable or at all. We are obligated to repurchase from J. Aron all volumes of the J. Aron Products upon expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, which may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, working capital and financial condition. Further, if we are not able to market and sell our finished products to credit worthy customers, we may be subject to delays in the collection of our accounts receivable and exposure to additional credit risk. Such increased exposure could negatively impact our liquidity due to our increased working capital needs as a result of the increase in the amount of crude oil inventory and accounts receivable we would have to carry on our balance sheet. Our long-term needs for cash include those to repay our indebtedness and other contractual obligations, support ongoing capital expenditures for equipment maintenance and upgrades, including during turnarounds at our refineries, and to complete our routine and normally scheduled maintenance, regulatory and security expenditures. 
 In addition, from time to time, we are required to spend significant amounts for repairs when one or more processing units experiences temporary shutdowns. We continue to utilize significant capital to upgrade equipment, improve facilities, and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. In connection with the Paulsboro, Torrance and Martinez acquisitions, we assumed certain significant environmental obligations, and we have assumed a portion of certain environmental liabilities that may arise in connection with the Martinez acquisition and may similarly do so in future acquisitions. We will likely incur substantial compliance costs in connection with new or changing environmental, health and safety regulations. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our liquidity and financial condition will affect our ability to satisfy any and all of these needs or obligations. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, regulatory, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the use and/or handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and the health and safety of the surrounding community. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 31 

We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent over time, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. In addition, a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely impact our ability to operate. For example, on July 21, 2021, the board of Bay Area Air Quality Management District BAAQMD voted to adopt amendments to Regulation 6-5: Particulate Emissions from Refinery Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units - 2021 Amendment Rule 6-5 Amendment requiring compliance with more stringent standards for particulate emissions from FCC units at refineries in the Bay Area that will be effective in 2026. The regulation does not require that any specific technology be utilized to meet the new standards. The costs incurred by us to achieve the new emissions standards at our Martinez refinery within the required timeframe may be significant, and there can be no assurance that the measures we implement will achieve the required emissions reductions. Additionally, on September 16, 2022, the state of California enacted SB 1322, The California Oil Refinery Cost Disclosure Act. Effective in 2023, this bill will require operators of refineries in the state that produce gasoline meeting California specifications, within 30 days of the end of each calendar month, to submit to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission certain information regarding petroleum sales volumes and prices. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future spills, discharges or releases, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Potential further laws and regulations related to climate change could have a material adverse impact on our operations and adversely affect our facilities. 
 Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. We believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention, with the potential for further laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect our ongoing operations. 
 In addition, as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined products. Extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation. We could also incur substantial costs to protect or repair these facilities. 
 Regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or clean energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing federal Clean Air Act. EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to 
 32 

incur costs to monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and trade systems and renewable portfolio standards (such as AB 32). On September 23, 2020 the Governor of California issued an executive order effectively banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks by 2035 and requiring zero-emission medium to heavy duty vehicles by 2045 everywhere feasible. The executive order requires state agencies to build out sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Regulatory requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Requirements to reduce emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs put in place. For example, in September 2016, the state of California enacted Senate Bill 32 which further reduces greenhouse gas emissions targets to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Two regulations implemented to achieve these goals are Cap-and-Trade and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS ). In 2012, CARB implemented Cap-and-Trade. This program currently places a cap on GHGs and we are required to acquire a sufficient number of credits to cover emissions from our refineries and our in-state sales of gasoline and diesel. In 2009, CARB adopted the LCFS, which required a 10 reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel by 2020. In 2018, CARB amended the LCFS to require a 20 reduction by 2030. Compliance is achieved through blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each of these programs is facilitated through a market-based credit system. If sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase or we are unable to pass through costs to our customers, we have to pay a higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 As noted above, on September 23, 2020, the California Governor issued Executive Order N-79-20 N-79-20 Order intended to further reduce GHGs within the state. The N-79-20 Order sets a 2035 goal of no sale of internal combustion engines for passenger cars and pickup trucks within California, and a 2045 goal of no sale of internal combustion engine medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and off-road vehicles and equipment. However, the N-79-20 Order would still allow used internal combustion engine vehicles to be used and sold after these dates. In an effort to accomplish the 2035 goal, on August 25, 2022, CARB voted unanimously to adopt the Advanced Clean Cars II ACCII regulations. According to CARB, the ACCII regulations will rapidly scale down light-duty passenger car, truck, and SUV emissions starting with the 2026 model year through 2035. The regulations are two-pronged. First, they amend the California Zero-emission Vehicle Regulation to require an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles, and rely on advanced vehicle technologies, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell electric, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, to meet air quality and climate change emissions standards. Second, the regulations amend the California Low-emission Vehicle Regulations to include increasingly stringent standards for gasoline cars and heavier passenger trucks to continue to reduce smog-forming emissions while the sector transitions toward 100 electrification by 2035. As to the 2045 goal, it is currently uncertain how the N-79-20 Order may be ultimately implemented by various California regulatory agencies. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions through future adopted regulatory requirements, we may not be able to pass these costs to our customers. These future regulatory requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 33 

Environmental clean-up and remediation costs of our sites and environmental litigation, including related to climate change, could decrease our net cash flow, reduce our results of operations and impair our financial condition. 
 We may be subject to liability for the investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own, lease, occupy or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the treatment or disposal of regulated materials. We may become involved in litigation or other proceedings related to the foregoing. If we were to be held responsible for damages in any such litigation or proceedings, such costs may not be covered by insurance and may be material. Historical soil and groundwater contamination has been identified at our refineries. Currently, remediation projects for such contamination are underway in accordance with regulatory requirements at our refineries. In connection with the acquisitions of certain of our refineries and logistics assets, the prior owners have retained certain liabilities or indemnified us for certain liabilities, including those relating to pre-acquisition soil and groundwater conditions, and in some instances we have assumed certain liabilities and environmental obligations, including certain existing and potential remediation obligations. If the prior owners fail to satisfy their obligations for any reason, or if significant liabilities arise in the areas in which we assumed liability, we may become responsible for remediation expenses and other environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. As a result, in addition to making capital expenditures or incurring other costs to comply with environmental laws, we also may be liable for significant environmental litigation or for investigation and remediation costs and other liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of these assets by prior owners, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Material Cash Requirements . 
 We may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, or other per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, PFAS ), asbestos, benzene, silica dust and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs for the alleged migration of contamination from our properties. A significant increase in the number or success of these claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Recently, we have been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state and federal agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of PFAS and additional PFAS-related laws may be developed at the local, state and federal level that could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies or otherwise affect our business. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise. We may be subject to asserted or unasserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions. 
 Changes in law or interpretation of settled law and changes in policy, including with respect to climate change, other environmental regulations or regulations mandating efficiency standards or the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components, could adversely affect our operations and results by increasing our cost of compliance, delaying or eliminating available business opportunities and/or preventing or limiting existing operations. Our operations also may give rise to federal, state or local government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations. 
 34 

We operate in jurisdictions where very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur in the context of litigation. Private plaintiffs may also initiate legal action against us for alleged environmental impacts. These parties may attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas (including seeking to reduce the production and sale of hydrocarbon products through litigation targeting the company or other industry participants), gain political notoriety, or obtain monetary awards from the company. For example, in recent years, private litigation has been increasingly initiated against oil and gas companies by local and state agencies and private parties alleging climate change impacts arising from their operations and seeking damages and equitable relief. We have not had any climate change litigation initiated against us to date and we cannot reasonably predict whether any such litigation will be initiated against us or, if initiated, what the outcome would be. If any such litigation were to be initiated against us, at a minimum, we would incur legal and other expenses to defend such lawsuits, which amounts may be significant. If we failed to prevail in any such litigation and were required to pay significant damages and/or materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our pipelines are subject to federal and/or state regulations, which could reduce profitability and the amount of cash we generate. 
 Our transportation activities are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the United States Department of Transportation, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or what impact such proposals may have. Projected operating costs related to our pipelines reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations, and these costs may increase due to future acquisitions, changes in regulation, changes in use, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues. 
 Record refining industry profits have raised the concern of public policy experts and federal and state policymakers, who have questioned whether these profits are justified, or whether they constituted a windfall to the industry and have proposed legislation that if enacted could adversely affect our profitability. 
 In 2022, record refining industry profits have raised the concern of many public policy experts and federal and state policymakers, who have questioned whether these profits were justified, or whether they constituted a windfall to the industry and have proposed legislation that if enacted could adversely affect our profitability. In particular, on December 5, 2022, the Governor of the State of California proposed a bill that would impose a penalty on oil refiners in the State of California based on what the State determines to be excessive profits. To the extent that such legislation is enacted in California or similar legislation is enacted in any of the other jurisdictions in which we operate our refineries, our business, results of operations, profitability and cash flows could be adversely impacted. 
 We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. 
 Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. These authorizations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal or modification and can require operational changes to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and/or health and safety. A violation of authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions, and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 35 

We may incur significant liabilities under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations, which are complex and change frequently. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, in addition to laws and regulations affecting the transportation of crude oil by rail in North America. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for, costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our pending renewable diesel project may not commence operations when we expect, or at all, and, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the renewable diesel project into our business, consummate the proposed joint venture transaction or realize the anticipated benefits of this investment. 
 The completion of the renewable business project is subject to the successful incorporation of certain existing idled assets at the Chalmette refinery, along with a newly-constructed pre-treatment unit to establish a 20,000 bpd renewable diesel production facility, with the goal of being in production in the first half of 2023. Concurrent with our activities to progress the project, we entered into a definitive agreement with Eni, to partner in a 50-50 joint venture, SBR, which will own the renewable diesel facility upon consummation of the transaction, and which is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that we will close the transaction or complete the renewable diesel project on the timeframe that we anticipate, or at all. Failure to complete the renewable diesel project or any delays in completing it could have an adverse impact on our future business and operations. In addition, we will have incurred significant capital and investment-related expenses without realizing the expected benefits. 
 Additionally, if the renewable diesel project is completed and/or the proposed joint venture transaction closes, we will have certain obligations and liabilities to the joint venture as the construction manager, operator and provider of services. Further, if the proposed joint venture transaction closes, SBR will be operated as a separate entity and we will not fully control its operations. There can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and operating synergies of the renewable diesel facility or the joint venture. Our estimates regarding the earnings, operating cash flow, capital expenditures and liabilities resulting from this investment may prove to be incorrect. This project involves risks, including: 
 diversion of management time and attention from our existing business; 
 reliance on our joint venture partner and their financial condition; 
 risk that our joint venture partner does not always share our goals and objectives; and 
 certain obligations that we have to fund capital expenditures relating to this project. 
 36 

Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters and developments related to climate change may negatively impact our business and our access to capital markets. 
 Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters may impact our business as it relates to the use of refined products, climate change, increasing public expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential use of substitutes or replacements to our products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased regulations and litigation, and adverse impacts on our access to capital markets. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders may advocate for divestment of fossil fuel investments and encourage lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the manufacturing of refined products. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of capital from our industry, which could have a negative impact on our access to, and costs of, capital. This scrutiny, coupled with changes in consumer behavior, attitudes and preferences with respect to the generation and consumption of energy and the use of fossil fuels, may continue to result in (a) the enactment of climate change related regulations, policies and initiatives, including alternative energy requirements, (b) further technological advances related to the generation, storage and consumption of energy through alternative methods such as wind and solar and (c) increased demand for and/or availability of non-fossil fuel energy sources and related consumer products such as electric vehicles and renewable power supplies. These developments may also lead to reduced demand for our products, a reduction in our revenue, higher costs and an overall decrease in our profitability. 
 Additionally, increased attention and scrutiny regarding climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation, which could increase our costs and/or otherwise negatively affect our operations and overall profitability, and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. 
 Some of our competitors may have a competitive advantage by providing alternative energy sources or by owning their own retail sites. 
 We compete with other companies and industries that may provide alternative means to satisfy fuel and energy requirements to their customers or own their own retail network. The refining industry is highly competitive with respect to petroleum product capacity and feedstock supply. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks, and for third-party retail outlets for our refined petroleum products. Such companies that produce alternative energy sources or own their own retail sites may be better positioned to deal with changes in refining capacity, depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. 
 We may be negatively affected by the rate of inflation and its impact on the global economy. 
 Current inflation within the economy has resulted in increased interest rates and capital costs, contributed to supply shortages, increased the cost of living and labor, and other related items. As a result of inflation, which may continue, we expect to encounter higher increases in the cost of feedstocks, labor, materials, and other inputs necessary in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks. Although we may take actions to counteract the impacts of inflation, if these actions are not effective it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, higher future inflation or concerns of a recession could impact the demand for our products and services. 
 37 

We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs. 
 In the past, global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and may again be, subject to disruption and volatile due to a variety of factors, including uncertainty in the financial services sector, low consumer confidence, falling commodity prices, geopolitical issues and generally weak economic conditions. In addition, the fixed income markets could experience periods of extreme volatility that may negatively impact market liquidity conditions. As a result, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets could increase substantially at times while the availability of funds from those markets diminishes significantly. In particular, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, which may be subject to unforeseen disruptions, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due. Moreover, without adequate funding, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, complete future acquisitions, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
 Any political instability, military strikes, sustained military campaigns, terrorist activity, changes in foreign policy, or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and Russia s military action in Ukraine starting in February 2022. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the war in Ukraine has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in the financial markets and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Furthermore, a protracted conflict between Ukraine and Russia, or any escalation of that conflict, may result in additional financial and economic sanctions and import and/or export controls imposed on Russia by the United States, the UK, the EU, Canada and others, such as the recent EU ban on oil products from Russia effective February 5, 2023, which may have adverse impacts on the wider global economy and market conditions and could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Any further political instability, military strikes, sustained military campaigns, terrorist activity, changes in foreign policy in areas or regions of the world where we acquire crude oil and other raw materials or sell our refined products may affect our business in unpredictable ways, including forcing us to increase security measures and causing disruptions of supplies and distribution markets. We may also be subject to United States trade and economic sanctions laws, which change frequently as a result of foreign policy developments, and which may necessitate changes to our crude oil acquisition activities. Further, like other industrial companies, our facilities may be the target of terrorist activities or subject to catastrophic events such as natural disasters and pandemic illness. Any act of war, terrorism, or other catastrophic events that resulted in damage to, or otherwise disrupts the operating activities of, any of our refineries or third-party facilities upon which we are dependent for our business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 38 

A cyber-attack on, or other failure of, our technology infrastructure could affect our business and assets, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are becoming increasingly dependent on our technology infrastructure and certain critical information systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely and effectively operate our respective assets and businesses. These information systems include data network and telecommunications, internet access, our websites, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our refineries and logistics assets. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our technology infrastructure and information systems. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, cyber-attacks, which may render data systems unusable, and physical threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure. Additionally, our business is highly dependent on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems, including our enterprise resource planning tools. We process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems. Furthermore, we rely on information systems across our respective operations, including the management of supply chain and various other processes and transactions. As a result, a disruption on any information systems at our refineries or logistics assets, may cause disruptions to our collective operations. 
 The potential for such security threats or system failures has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software, emergency recovery processes and a formal disaster recovery plan to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe, and our formal disaster recovery plan and other implemented measures may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. If a key system were hacked or otherwise interfered with by an unauthorized user, or were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, or any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, it could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, damage our reputation and subject us to additional costs and liabilities. The increase in companies and individuals working remotely has increased the frequency and scope of cyber-attacks and the risk of potential cybersecurity incidents, both deliberate attacks and unintentional events. While, to date, we have not had a significant cybersecurity breach or attack that had a material impact on our business or results of operations, if we were to be subject to a material successful cyber intrusion, it could result in remediation or service restoration costs, increased cyber protection costs, lost revenues, litigation or regulatory actions by governmental authorities, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage and damage to our competitiveness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Cyber-attacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, and U.S. government warnings have indicated that infrastructure assets, including pipelines, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. These attacks include, without limitation, malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches. These attacks may be perpetrated by state-sponsored groups, hacktivists , criminal organizations or private individuals (including employee malfeasance). Current efforts by the federal government, including the Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure executive order, the issuance of new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators issued by the Department of Homeland Security s Transportation Security Administration following a cyber-attack on a major petroleum pipeline in 2021, and any potential future regulations could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations. 
 39 

Further, our business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur. We do not carry insurance specifically for cybersecurity events; however, certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage for a cyber-event resulting in ensuing property damage from an otherwise insured peril. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. 
 Competition from companies that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have extensive retail outlets, make alternative fuels or have greater financial and other resources than we do could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in regions of the United States in which we operate, as well as with domestic refiners in other regions and foreign refiners that import products into the United States. In addition, we compete with other refiners, producers and marketers in other industries that supply their own renewable fuels or alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Certain of our competitors have larger and more complex refineries, and may be able to realize lower per-barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain substantially all of our feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. We are not engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. We do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of crude oil supply and other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations and they may also be able to obtain more favorable trade credit terms. 
 Newer or upgraded refineries will often be more efficient than our refineries, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We have taken significant measures to maintain our refineries including the installation of new equipment and redesigning older equipment to improve our operations. However, these actions involve significant uncertainties, since upgraded equipment may not perform at expected throughput levels, the yield and product quality of new equipment may differ from design specifications and modifications may be needed to correct equipment that does not perform as expected. Any of these risks associated with new equipment, redesigned older equipment or repaired equipment could lead to lower revenues or higher costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. Over time, our refineries or certain refinery units may become obsolete, or be unable to compete, because of the construction of new, more efficient facilities by our competitors. 
 We must make substantial capital expenditures on our operating facilities to maintain their reliability and efficiency. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and/or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities (or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment, including turnarounds) could adversely affect our ability to achieve targeted internal rates of return and operating results. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
 denial or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals and/or permits; 
 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; 
 disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials; 
 severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers; 
 shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; 
 40 

market-related increases in a project s debt or equity financing costs; and/or 
 non-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors involved with a project. 
 Our refineries contain many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. Equipment, even if properly maintained, may require significant capital expenditures and expenses to keep it operating at optimum efficiency. One or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds for such units. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues during the period of time that the units are not operating. 
 Our forecasted internal rates of return are also based upon our projections of future market fundamentals, which are not within our control, including changes in general economic conditions, inflation, slow growth, recession, impact of new regulations, available alternative supply and customer demand. Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our business. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 We are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding employee and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability. 
 We are subject to the requirements of the OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local residents. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, process safety standards and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could result in claims against us that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the cash flows of the business if we are subjected to significant fines or compliance costs. 
 Product liability and operational liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Product liability and liability arising from our operations are significant risks. Substantial damage awards have been made in certain jurisdictions against manufacturers and resellers of petroleum products based upon claims for injuries and property damage caused by the use of or exposure to various products. Failure of our products to meet required specifications or claims that a product is inherently defective could result in product liability claims from third parties, including our shippers and customers, and also arise from contaminated or off-specification product in commingled pipelines and storage tanks and/or defective fuels. We may also be subject to personal injury claims arising from incidents that occur in connection with or relating to our operations. Product liability and personal injury claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance. 
 We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, local and foreign taxes such as income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, property, gross receipts, withholding and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, such as the IRA, are continuously being enacted or proposed and could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. These liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authorities, which could increase our tax liabilities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may also subject us to interest and penalties. There can be no certainty that our federal, state, local or foreign taxes could be passed on to our customers. 
 41 

Acquisitions that we may undertake in the future involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits. 
 We may not be successful in acquiring additional assets, and any acquisitions that we do consummate may not produce the anticipated benefits or may have adverse effects on our business and operating results. We may selectively consider strategic acquisitions in the future within the refining and mid-stream sector based on performance through the cycle, advantageous access to crude oil supplies, attractive refined products market fundamentals and access to distribution and logistics infrastructure. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth and many other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to the diversion of management time and attention from our existing business, liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets. We may also enter into transition services agreements in the future with sellers of any additional refineries we acquire. Such services may not be performed timely and effectively, and any significant disruption in such transition services or unanticipated costs related to such services could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, it is likely that, when we acquire refineries, we will not have access to the type of historical financial information that we will require regarding the prior operation of the refineries. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to evaluate the probable impact of significant acquisitions on our financial performance until we have operated the acquired refineries for a substantial period of time. 
 A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations. 
 Most hourly employees at our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements through the USW, the IOW and the IBEW. These agreements are scheduled to expire on various dates in 2024 through 2028 (See Item 1. Business - Employees). Future negotiations prior to the expiration of our collective agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect our operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses at the refineries. 
 Our business may suffer if any of our senior executives or other key employees discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity. 
 Our future success depends to a large extent on the services of our senior executives and other key employees. Our business depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified employees in all areas of our operations, including engineering, accounting, business operations, finance and other key back-office and mid-office personnel. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced employees with proficiency in multiple tasks. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these executives or employees could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 42 

Our hedging activities may limit our potential gains, exacerbate potential losses and involve other risks. 
 We may enter into commodity derivatives contracts to hedge our crude price risk or crack spread risk with respect to a portion of our expected gasoline and distillate production on a rolling basis or to hedge our exposure to the price of natural gas, which is a significant component of our refinery operating expenses. Consistent with that policy we may hedge some percentage of our future crude and natural gas supply. We may enter into hedging arrangements with the intent to secure a minimum fixed cash flow stream on the volume of products hedged during the hedge term and to protect against volatility in commodity prices. Our hedging arrangements may fail to fully achieve these objectives for a variety of reasons, including our failure to have adequate hedging arrangements, if any, in effect at any particular time and the failure of our hedging arrangements to produce the anticipated results. We may not be able to procure adequate hedging arrangements due to a variety of factors. Moreover, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in crude oil, refined product and natural gas prices. 
 In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: 
 the volumes of our actual use of crude oil or natural gas or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement; 
 accidents, interruptions in feedstock transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries, or those of our suppliers or customers; 
 changes in commodity prices have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our hedging arrangements, resulting in us being subject to margin calls; 
 the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or 
 a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement. 
 As a result, the effectiveness of our hedging strategy could have a material impact on our financial results. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In addition, these hedging activities involve basis risk. Basis risk in a hedging arrangement occurs when the price of the commodity we hedge is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged commodity is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. For example, a New York Mercantile Exchange index used for hedging certain volumes of our crude oil or refined products may have more or less variability than the actual cost or price we realize for such crude oil or refined products. We may not hedge all the basis risk inherent in our hedging arrangements and derivative contracts. 
 Our commodity derivative activities could result in period-to-period earnings volatility. 
 We do not currently apply hedge accounting to any of our commodity derivative contracts and, as a result, unrealized gains and losses will be charged to our earnings based on the increase or decrease in the market value of such unsettled positions. These gains and losses may be reflected in our income statement in periods that differ from when the settlement of the underlying hedged items are reflected in our income statement. Such derivative gains or losses in earnings may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of our underlying operational performance. 
 43 

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness. 
 Our indebtedness may significantly affect our financial flexibility in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we have total debt of 1,470.1 million, excluding unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of 35.2 million, and we could incur additional borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). W e may incur additional indebtedness in the future including additional secured indebtedness, subject to the satisfaction of any debt incurrence and, if applicable, lien incurrence limitation covenants in our existing financing agre ements. Although we were in compliance with incurrence covenants during the year ended December 31, 2022 t o the extent that any of our activities triggered these covenants, there are no assurances that conditions could not change significantly, and that such changes could adversely impact our ability to meet some of these incurrence covenants at the time that we needed to. Failure to meet the incurrence covenants could impose certain incremental restrictions on, among other matters, our ability to incur new debt (including secured debt) and also may limit the extent to which we may make new investments or incur new liens. 
 The level of our indebtedness has several important consequences for our future operations, including that: 
 a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes; 
 under certain circumstances, covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets and make certain investments; 
 in certain circumstances these covenants also require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry, such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise; 
 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and 
 we may be at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less leveraged; and we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions. 
 Our indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations, certain of which contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions. Our, and our subsidiaries , ability to meet future principal obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing. Refinancing may not be possible and additional financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. 
 We may not be able to secure necessary financing on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 We currently have notes outstanding with varying maturity dates beginning in 2025 and ending in 2028. Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date in 2025. We can make no assurance that we will be able to refinance this agreement on acceptable terms prior to its maturity date. Market disruptions or other credit factors, such as rising inflation and higher interest rates, are expected to increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to refinance our obligations as they become due. Further, ESG concerns and other pressures on the oil and gas industry could lead to increased costs of financing or limit our access to the capital markets. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or access additional credit, or if short-term or long-term borrowing costs significantly increase, our ability to finance current operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations could be adversely affected. 
 44 

Despite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above. 
 We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future including additional secured or unsecured debt. Although our debt instruments and financing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the leverage risks described above would increase. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. 
 Our future credit ratings could adversely affect our business, the cost of our borrowing, and our ability to obtain credit in the future. 
 Changes in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil and other suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms for our purchases or require us to post security or letters of credit prior to payment. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, any imposition by these suppliers of more burdensome payment terms on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This, in turn, could cause us to be unable to operate one or more of our refineries at full capacity. 
 Our 2028 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes are rated B1 by Moody s, BB by S P, and BB- by Fitch. Any adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact the terms of credit we receive from our suppliers and require us to prepay or post collateral. Additionally, adverse actions taken by the rating agencies on our corporate credit rating or the rating of our notes may increase our cost of borrowings or hinder our ability to raise financing in the capital markets or have an unfavorable impact on the credit terms we have with our suppliers, which could impair our ability to grow our business, increase our liquidity and make cash distributions to our members. 
 Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, including the indentures governing our notes, may limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service our indebtedness. 
 Various covenants in our current and future debt instruments and other financing arrangements, including the indentures governing our notes, may restrict our and our subsidiaries financial flexibility in a number of ways. Our current indebtedness and the indentures that govern our notes subject us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, make distributions, or make certain other restricted payments and investments, consummate certain asset sales or asset swaps, conduct businesses other than our current businesses, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Some of our debt instruments also require our subsidiaries to satisfy or maintain certain financial condition tests in certain circumstances. Our ability to meet these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not meet such tests. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our existing debt could result in an event of default that could enable our lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of such debt, to declare the outstanding principal, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Events beyond our control, may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. If we were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under our other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full. 
 45 

Provisions in our indentures and other agreements could discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party. 
 Certain provisions of our indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third-party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change of control as described in the indentures governing the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2028 Senior Notes, holders of our notes could require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, at the date of repurchase. Certain other significant agreements of ours such as our agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Third Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron also contain provisions related to a change in control that could make it more difficult or expensive for a third-party to acquire us. 
 Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure 
 Under a tax receivable agreement, PBF Energy is required to pay the pre-IPO owners of PBF LLC for certain realized or assumed tax benefits it may claim arising in connection with its initial public offering and future exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of its Class A common stock and related transactions (the Tax Receivable Agreement ). The indentures governing the senior notes allow us, under certain circumstances, to make distributions sufficient for PBF Energy to pay its obligations arising from the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 PBF Energy entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment from time to time On-Going Payments by PBF Energy to the holders of PBF LLC Series A Units and PBF LLC Series B Units for certain tax benefits it may claim arising in connection with its prior offerings and future exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of its Class A common stock and related transactions, and the amounts it may pay could be significant. 
 PBF Energy s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are PBF Energy s obligations and not obligations of PBF Holding, PBF Finance, or any of PBF Holding s other subsidiaries. However, because PBF Energy is primarily a holding company with limited operations of its own, its ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on our ability to make future distributions to it. The indentures governing the senior notes allow us to make tax distributions (as defined in the applicable indentures), and it is expected that PBF Energy s share of these tax distributions will be in amounts sufficient to allow PBF Energy to make On-Going Payments. The indentures governing the senior notes also allow us to make a distribution sufficient to allow PBF Energy to make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon a change in control, so long as we offer to purchase all of the senior notes outstanding at a price in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any. If PBF Energy s share of the distributions it receives under these specific provisions of the indentures is insufficient to satisfy its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, PBF Energy may cause us to make distributions in accordance with other provisions of the indentures in order to satisfy such obligations. 
 Our existing indebtedness may limit our ability to make distributions to PBF LLC, and in turn for PBF Energy to pay these obligations. These provisions may deter a potential sale of us to a third-party and may otherwise make it less likely that a third-party would enter into a change of control transaction with PBF Energy or us. 
 PBF Energy has recognized, as of December 31, 2022, a liability for the Tax Receivable Agreement of 338.6 million. As PBF Energy records future taxable income, increases in its Tax Receivable Agreement liability may be necessary. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments. Moreover, future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that PBF Energy determines in accordance with the Tax Receivable Agreement. Neither PBF Energy nor any of its subsidiaries will be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if the IRS subsequently disallows part or all of the tax benefits that gave rise to such prior payments.

Risks Related to Our Affiliation with PBFX 
 We depend upon PBFX for a substantial portion of our refineries logistics needs and have obligations for minimum volume commitments in our commercial agreements with PBFX. 
 We depend on PBFX to receive, handle, store and transfer crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas for us from our operations and sources located throughout the United States and Canada in support of certain of our refineries under long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with us. These commercial agreements have an initial term ranging from one to fifteen years and generally include minimum quarterly commitments and inflation escalators. If we fail to meet the minimum commitments during any calendar quarter, we will be required to make a shortfall payment quarterly to PBFX equal to the volume of the shortfall multiplied by the applicable fee. 
 PBFX s operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in receiving, handling, storing and transferring crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas, including: damages to its facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism; mechanical or structural failures at PBFX s facilities or at third-party facilities on which its operations are dependent; curtailments of operations relative to severe seasonal weather; inadvertent damage to our facilities from construction, farm and utility equipment; and other hazards. Any of these events or factors could result in severe damage or destruction to PBFX s assets or the temporary or permanent shut-down of PBFX s facilities. If PBFX is unable to serve our logistics needs, our ability to operate our refineries and receive crude oil and distribute products could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Torrance refinery and related logistics assets, we assumed certain pre-existing environmental liabilities related to certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination and monitoring activities, which reflect the estimated cost of the remediation obligations. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Torrance refinery and related logistics assets, we purchased a ten-year, 100.0 million environmental insurance policy to insure against unknown environmental liabilities. 
 On April 17, 2019, we received a Notice of Violation NOV from the South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD relating to Title V deviations alleged to have occurred in second half of 2018. In May 2022, the SCAQMD requested that we present a settlement proposal to resolve the NOV. On June 16, 2022, we presented a settlement offer of 456,820 to settle the NOV. On July 22, 2022, the SCAQMD presented a counter proposal of 1.2 million. On August 25, 2022, we presented a counter proposal of 736,845. On December 15, 2022, the SCAQMD accepted our counter proposal. The parties are currently drafting the settlement agreement. 
 On February 17, 2017, in Arnold Goldstein, et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, et al. , we and PBF LLC, and our subsidiaries, PBF Western Region and Torrance Refining and the manager of our Torrance refinery along with ExxonMobil were named as defendants in a class action and representative action complaint filed on behalf of Arnold Goldstein, John Covas, Gisela Janette La Bella and others similarly situated. The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles and alleges negligence, strict liability, ultra-hazardous activity, a continuing private nuisance, a permanent private nuisance, a continuing public nuisance, a permanent public nuisance and trespass resulting from the February 18, 2015 electrostatic precipitator ESP explosion at the Torrance refinery which was then owned and operated by ExxonMobil. The operation of the Torrance refinery by the PBF entities subsequent to our acquisition in July 2016 is also referenced in the complaint. To the extent that plaintiffs claims relate to the ESP explosion, ExxonMobil retained responsibility for any liabilities that would arise from the lawsuit pursuant to the agreement relating to the acquisition of the Torrance refinery. On July 2, 2018, the Court granted leave to plaintiffs to file a Second Amended Complaint alleging groundwater contamination. With the filing of the Second Amended Complaint, plaintiffs added an additional plaintiff, Hany Youssef. On October 15, 2019, the judge granted certification to two limited classes of property owners with Youssef as the sole class representative and named plaintiff, rejecting two other proposed subclasses based on negligence and on strict liability for ultrahazardous activities. The certified subclasses relate to trespass claims for ground contamination and nuisance for air emissions. On February 5, 2021, our motion for Limited Extension of Discovery Cut-Off and a Motion by plaintiffs for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint were heard by the Court. On May 5, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint for the third time to substitute Navarro for Youssef. On May 12, 2021, plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint TAC that contained significant changes and new claims, including individual claims, that were not included in the motion for leave to amend plaintiffs presented to the Court. On June 9, 2021, we filed a Motion to Dismiss/Strike the TAC. On June 23, 2021, plaintiffs filed their opposition to our Motion to Dismiss/Strike, to which we filed our reply on July 2, 2021. A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss/Strike the TAC was held on August 2, 2021 and the Court ordered that the TAC be struck and that the parties meet and confer with respect to the complaint. After meeting and conferring, plaintiffs agreed to submit a corrected TAC with changes reflecting the removal of Youssef and the substitution of Navarro as the named Plaintiff. On August 23, 2021, the Court approved the parties stipulation to take Navarro s deposition on September 23, 2021. Also, on August 23, 2021, the Court approved the parties stipulation to continue the pretrial dates with the new deadlines. On October 8, 2021, plaintiffs filed their Motion to Appoint Navarro as Class Representative. On October 29, 2021, we filed our opposition to this motion. On November 15, 2021, plaintiffs filed their reply. On February 8, 2022, the Court held a hearing on plaintiff s Motion to Appoint Navarro as Class Representative but did not act on the motion. Instead, the Court ordered the parties to submit draft orders for the Court s consideration. After considering the parties proposed orders, on July 5, 2022, the Court issued a final order ruling that Plaintiffs Motion to Substitute Navarro as Class Representative was denied and decertifying both of Plaintiffs proposed Air and Ground Subclasses. The order provided that the 
 48 

case will proceed with Navarro as the sole plaintiff and required the parties to meet and confer and propose a schedule for the remaining pretrial dates and a trial date. On July 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed a petition with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking permission to appeal the District Court s decertification order finding that Navarro is an inadequate class representative. Our answer to the petition was filed on July 29, 2022. On September 22, 2022, the Ninth Circuit issued an order denying Plaintiffs petition for permission to file an interlocutory appeal, confirming that the case will proceed with Navarro as the sole plaintiff. On September 27, 2022, the Plaintiff filed a schedule of pretrial and trial dates with a trial date of July 18, 2023, which was approved by the Court. On January 13, 2023, the Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On January 23, 2023, the Plaintiff filed its opposition to the Defendants motion. Defendants reply to Plaintiff s opposition was filed on January 30, 2023. Defendants motion was scheduled to be heard by the Court on February 13, 2023. On February 27, 2023, the Court issued an order granting our motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Plaintiff s trespass claim with prejudice and granted Plaintiff leave to amend his nuisance claims in conformity with the order if he can do so consistent with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. Plaintiff can file and serve an amended complaint no later than March 25, 2023. Per the order, failure to file a complaint by that date will waive Plaintiff s right to do so and the complaint will be dismissed with prejudice. We presently believe the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 On September 7, 2021, MRC filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against the BAAQMD requesting the Court to declare as invalid, unenforceable, and ultra vires the BAAMQD s July 21, 2021, adoption of Rule 6-5 Amendment. MRC is also seeking a writ of mandate ordering the BAAQMD to vacate and rescind the adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, as well as appropriate declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and reasonable costs incurred by MRC to bring this Petition/Complaint. In the Petition/Complaint MRC alleges that: its feasible alternative Particulate Matter PM reduction proposal that would achieve significant PM reductions while avoiding the significant costs and environmental impacts of the BAAQMD s adopted PM limit, was improperly removed from consideration and not presented to the BAAQMD Board when the Rule 6-5 Amendment was adopted with the current PM standard; when adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment, the BAAQMD flagrantly ignored numerous mandatory requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA and the California Health and Safety Code; the BAAQMD s adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment also violated California common law; and these failings render the Rule 6-5 Amendment ultra vires, illegal, and unenforceable. We held mandatory settlement conferences with the BAAQMD on October 27, 2021 and December 15, 2021. On December 9, 2022, we filed a Motion To Augment/Correct The Administrative Record regarding various documents that the BAAQMD is currently withholding and do not plan to include in the administrative record. On December 30, 2022, the BAAQMD filed its opposition to our motion. On January 12, 2023, we filed our reply to the BAAQMD s opposition. The hearing on our motion was held on February 2, 2023. At the hearing, although the Court partially denied our motion concerning documents where the BAAQMD asserted the attorney client privilege, the Court held that CEQA places a heavy burden on the BAAQMD in justifying withholding documents based on the deliberative privilege. At the Court s request, the parties agreed to a process whereby they will jointly identify approximately 50 of the withheld/redacted documents for the Court to review, and the Court will rule on those documents. The parties will then apply the Court s ruling to the remainder of the withheld documents. If there is still a dispute, the parties will bring the dispute back before the Court. The Court set the writ hearing for September 20, 2023. It is currently expected that the non-disputed portion of the Administrative Record will be lodged with the Court in early February 2023. If the Court ultimately grants our motion on the deliberative privilege, the Administrative Record will be augmented. We expect another mandatory settlement conference to be held in first quarter of 2023. We presently believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA ), also known as Superfund, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for investigation and the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. As discussed more fully above, certain of our sites are subject to these laws and we may be held liable for investigation and remediation costs or claims for natural resource damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Analogous state laws impose similar responsibilities and liabilities on responsible parties. In our current normal operations, we have generated waste, some of which falls within the statutory definition of a hazardous substance and some of which may have been disposed of at sites that may require cleanup under Superfund. 
 As the ultimate outcomes of the pending matters discussed above are uncertain, we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of their resolution but any such amount is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, individually or in the aggregate.

PART II 
 
 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Market Information 
 We are a privately-owned company with no established public trading market for our membership units. 
 Holders 
 At February 24, 2023, 100 of our outstanding membership interests were held by PBF LLC. PBF Finance had 100 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which were held by us. None of the membership interests are publicly-traded, and none were issued or sold in 2022. 
 Dividend and Distribution Policy 
 In cases when there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, we are permitted under our debt agreements to make distributions; however, our ability to make distributions to PBF LLC is, and in the future may be, limited by covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility, the 2028 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and other debt instruments. Subject to certain exceptions, the Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes prohibit us from making distributions to PBF LLC if certain defaults exist. Our ability to continue to comply with our debt covenants is, to a significant degree, subject to our operating results, which are dependent on a number of factors outside of our control. 
 We are a holding company and all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. We have no independent means of generating revenue other than through assets owned by our subsidiaries. In order for us to make any distributions, we will need to cause our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. We and our subsidiaries are generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of the limited liability company (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. As a result, we may be unable to obtain cash from our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations and make distributions to PBF LLC, when necessary. 
 We make, from time to time, cash distributions in amounts sufficient for PBF LLC to make tax distributions to its members and may make additional distributions to the extent necessary for PBF Energy to declare and pay any quarterly cash dividends. The declaration, amount and payment of this and any other future distributions by us will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and the board of directors of PBF Energy, which is the sole managing member of our sole member (PBF LLC), and we are not obligated under any applicable laws, governing documents or any contractual agreements with PBF LLC s existing owners or otherwise to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions (other than the obligations of PBF LLC to make tax distributions to its members). 
 We made 571.4 million in distributions to PBF LLC during the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022 PBF LLC used 25.0 million to make non-tax distributions of 0.20 per unit to its members, of which 24.8 million was distributed to PBF Energy and the balance was distributed to PBF LLC s other members. PBF Energy used this 24.8 million to pay cash dividends of 0.20 per share of its Class A common stock on November 29, 2022. PBF LLC also made aggregate tax distributions to its members of 1,130.1 million, of which 1,121.8 million was made to PBF Energy. See Item 1A. Risk Factors .

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business , Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 2. Properties , and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , respectively, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In this Item 7, we discuss results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and comparisons of the results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Discussions of results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and comparisons of the results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as believes, expects, may, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates, anticipates or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our strategies, objectives, intentions, resources and expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, which we refer to as cautionary statements, are disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results include: 
 supply, demand, prices and other market conditions for our products, or crude oil, including volatility in commodity prices, or constraints arising from federal, state or local governmental actions or environmental and/or social activists that reduce crude oil production or availability in the regions in which we operate our pipelines and facilities; 
 rate of inflation and its impacts on supply and demand, pricing, and supply chain disruption; 
 the effects related to, or resulting from, Russia's military action in Ukraine, including the imposition of additional sanctions and export controls, as well as the broader impacts to financial markets and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment; 
 the effectiveness of our crude oil sourcing strategies, including our crude by rail strategy and related commitments; 
 our obligation to buy RINs and market risks related to the volatility in the price of RINs required to comply with the RFS and GHG emission credits required to comply with various GHG emission programs, such as AB 32; 
 our ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs (including general and administrative expenses) and generate earnings and cash flow; 
 52 

our expectations with respect to our capital spending and turnaround projects; 
 the impact of current and future laws, rulings and governmental regulations, including restrictions on the exploration and/or production of crude oil in the state of California, the implementation of rules and regulations regarding transportation of crude oil by rail or in response to the potential impacts of climate change, decarbonization and future energy transition; 
 adverse impacts related to legislation by the federal government lifting the restrictions on exporting U.S. crude oil or subjecting us to trade and sanctions laws, which change frequently as a result of foreign policy developments, and which may necessitate changes to our crude oil acquisition activities; 
 our ability to target and execute expense reduction measures and achieve opportunities to improve our liquidity, including continued repurchases of our outstanding debt securities or otherwise further reducing our debt, and/or potential sales of non-operating assets or other real property; 
 political pressure and influence of environmental groups and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the refining and processing of crude oil and refined products, and the related adverse impacts from changes in our regulatory environment, such as the effects of compliance with AB 32, or from actions taken by environmental interest groups; 
 the risk of cyber-attacks; 
 our increased dependence on technology; 
 the effects of competition in our markets; 
 our ability to make acquisitions or investments, including in renewable diesel production, such as our proposed joint venture transaction with Eni, on any announced time frame or at all, and to realize the benefits from such acquisitions or investments; 
 if our proposed joint venture transaction is consummated, our ability to successfully manage SBR's operations together with our joint venture partner; 
 liabilities arising from recent acquisitions or investments, that are unforeseen or exceed our expectations; 
 our expectations and timing with respect to our acquisition activity; 
 adverse developments in our relationship with both our key employees and unionized employees; 
 o ur indebtedness, including the impact of potential downgrades to our corporate credit rating and unsecured notes; 
 changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and capital costs; 
 restrictive covenants in our indebtedness that may adversely affect our operational flexibility or ability to make distributions; 
 counterparty credit and performance risk exposure related to our supply and inventory intermediation arrangements; 
 termination of our Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron, which is scheduled to expire in December 2024 and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, as we would be required to finance our crude oil, intermediate and refined products inventory covered by the agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to repurchase from J. Aron certain J. Aron Products upon termination of the agreement; 
 our assumptions regarding payments arising under PBF Energy s Tax Receivable Agreement and other arrangements relating to PBF Energy; 
 the impact of disruptions to crude or feedstock supply to any of our refineries, including disruptions related to PBFX or with third-party logistics infrastructure or operations, including pipeline, marine and rail transportation; and 
 any decisions we continue to make with respect to our energy-related logistics assets that may be transferred to PBFX. 
 53 

We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not in fact occur. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on those statements. 
 Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. 
 Executive Summary 
 Our business operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. We own and operate six domestic oil refineries and related assets located in Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, Toledo, Ohio, Chalmette, Louisiana, Torrance, California and Martinez, California. Our refineries have a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 1,000,000 bpd, and a weighted-average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.7 based on current operating conditions. The complexity and throughput capacity of our refineries are subject to change dependent upon configuration changes we make to respond to market conditions as well as a result of investments made to improve our facilities and maintain compliance with environmental and governmental regulations. Our six refineries are all engaged in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, and represent one reportable segment. 
 
 Factors Affecting Comparability 
 Our results over the past three years have been affected by the following events, the understanding of which will aid in assessing the comparability of our period to period financial performance and financial condition.

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we exercised our rights under the indenture governing the 9.25 senior secured notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Secured Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2025 Senior Secured Notes at a price of 104.625 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate redemption price for all 2025 Senior Secured Notes approximated 1.3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest. The difference between the carrying value of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on the date they were redeemed and the amount for which they were redeemed was 69.9 million and was recorded as a Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made a number of open market repurchases of our 2028 Senior Notes and our 2025 Senior Notes that resulted in the extinguishment of 24.9 million in principal of the 2028 Senior Notes and 5.0 million in principal of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amount outstanding of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes, excluding accrued interest, totaled 25.9 million and we recognized a 3.8 million gain on the extinguishment of this debt during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a number of open market repurchases of our 2028 Senior Notes and our 2025 Senior Notes that resulted in the extinguishment of 173.5 million in principal of the 2028 Senior Notes and 55.5 million in principal of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amount outstanding of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes, excluding accrued interest, totaled 146.8 million and we recognized a 79.9 million gain on the extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.

On December 21, 2020, we issued an additional 250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 245.7 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 On May 13, 2020, we issued 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 982.9 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 On February 14, 2020, we exercised our rights under the indenture governing the 7.00 senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Senior Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2023 Senior Notes at a price of 103.5 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate redemption price for all 2023 Senior Notes approximated 517.5 million plus accrued and unpaid interest. The difference between the carrying value of the 2023 Senior Notes on the date they were redeemed and the amount for which they were redeemed was 22.2 million and has been classified as Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ending December 31, 2020. 
 On January 24, 2020, we issued 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 987.0 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses. We used 517.5 million of the proceeds to fully redeem our 2023 Senior Notes and the balance to fund a portion of the cash consideration for Martinez Acquisition (as defined below). 
 PBF Holding Revolving Credit Facility 
 On May 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment of our existing Revolving Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Revolving Credit Agreement amended and extended the Revolving Credit Facility through January 2025 and increased the maximum commitment to 4.3 billion through May 2023 (currently set to adjust to 2.75 billion in May 2023 through January 2025). The amendments also redefine certain components of the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) to reflect the existence of the two tranches, tranche A which is comprised of existing lenders who have not elected to extend and whose commitments retain the existing maturity date under the existing revolving credit agreement of May 2, 2023 (the Tranche A Commitments and tranche B, which is comprised of existing and new lenders whose commitments have an extended maturity date of January 31, 2025 (the Tranche B Commitments ). The Tranche A Commitments total 1.55 billion and the Tranche B Commitments total 2.75 billion. The amendments also include changes to incorporate the adoption of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as a replacement of the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR ), changes to joint lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and other titles, and other changes related to the foregoing. In addition, an accordion feature allows for additional Tranche B Commitments of up to an additional 500.0 million plus an amount equal to the Tranche A Commitments for existing Tranche A lenders. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022 we made net repayments of 900.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2022. There was 900.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 
 Catalyst Financing Obligations 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we settled certain of our precious metals financing arrangements, resulting in reductions of debt of approximately 56.2 million and 31.7 million, respectively. 
 The volumes of the precious metal catalyst and the interest rates are fixed over the term of each financing arrangement. We are obligated to repurchase the precious metals catalyst at fair market value upon expiration of these leases. For all leases not renewed at maturity, we have the ability and intent to finance such debt through availability under our revolving credit facilities.

 Market Developments 
 The impact of the unprecedented global health and economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of the quarter ended March 31, 2020, created a shock in oil demand resulting in an economic challenge to our industry which has not occurred since our formation. This resulted in significant demand reduction for our refined products and atypical volatility in oil commodity prices. The demand for these products started to recover in 2021 and continued to improve in 2022. Additionally, refining margins improved significantly in 2022 as a result of high demand and global supply disruption. 
 Torrance Land Sales 
 On December 30, 2020, we closed on a third-party sale of parcels of real property acquired as part of the Torrance refinery, but not part of the refinery itself. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately 8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, included within Gain on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 East Coast Refining Reconfiguration 
 On December 31, 2020, we completed the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration. As part of the reconfiguration process, we temporarily idled certain of our major processing units at the Paulsboro refinery, resulting in lower overall throughput and inventory levels in addition to decreases in capital and operating costs. In 2022, we restarted several of these idled processing units. Based on this reconfiguration and subsequent restart of several processing units, our East Coast throughput capacity currently approximates 335,000 barrels per day. 
 Turnaround Costs and Assets under Construction 
 In 2020, we accelerated the recognition of approximately 56.2 million of unamortized deferred turnaround amortization costs associated with these idled units. Additionally, we abandoned certain projects related to assets under construction related to these idled assets, resulting in an impairment charge of approximately 11.9 million in 2020. 
 Capital Project Abandonments 
 During 2020, in connection with our strategic initiative to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including our East Coast Refining Reconfiguration, we reassessed our refinery wide slate of capital projects that were either in process or not yet placed into service as of December 31, 2020. Based on this reassessment and our strategic plan to reduce capital expenditures, we decided to abandon various capital projects across the refining system, resulting in an impairment charge of approximately 79.9 million in 2020. 
 Severance Costs 
 Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to strengthen our financial flexibility and rationalize overhead expenses, including workforce reduction. During the second quarter of 2020, we reduced headcount across our refineries, which resulted in approximately 12.9 million of severance related costs. Additionally, as a result of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration, we incurred charges in the fourth quarter of 2020 of approximately 11.8 million of severance related expenses. These severance costs were included in general and administrative expenses. 
 56 

Early Return of Railcars 
 In the fourth quarter of 2020 we agreed to voluntarily return a portion of railcars under an operating lease in order to rationalize certain components of our railcar fleet. Under the terms of the lease amendment, we agreed to pay amounts in lieu of satisfaction of return conditions (the early termination penalty ). As a result, we recognized an expense of 12.5 million within Cost of sales, consisting of charges for the early termination penalty and charges related to the remaining lease payments associated with the railcars identified within the amended lease, all of which were idled and out of service as of December 31, 2020. 
 Sale of Hydrogen Plants 
 On April 17, 2020, we closed on the sale of five hydrogen plants to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Air Products in a sale-leaseback transaction for gross cash proceeds of 530.0 million and recognized a gain of 471.1 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement, which was followed by the execution of long-term supply agreements in August 2020, through which Air Products will exclusively supply hydrogen, steam, carbon dioxide and other products to the Martinez, Torrance and Delaware City refineries for a term of fifteen years. 
 Martinez Acquisition 
 We acquired the Martinez refinery and related logistics assets from Shell Oil Products on February 1, 2020 for an aggregate purchase price of 1,253.4 million (the Martinez Acquisition ), including final working capital of 216.1 million and the obligation to make certain post-closing earn-out payments to Shell Oil Products based on certain earnings thresholds of the Martinez refinery for a period of up to four years (the Martinez Contingent Consideration ). The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand, including proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Martinez refinery is located on an 860-acre site in the City of Martinez, 30 miles northeast of San Francisco, California. The refinery is a high-conversion 157,000 bpd, dual-coking facility with a Nelson Complexity Index of 16.1, making it one of the most complex refineries in the United States. The facility is strategically positioned in Northern California and provides for operating and commercial synergies with the Torrance refinery located in Southern California. In addition to refining assets, the Martinez Acquisition includes a number of high-quality onsite logistics assets including a deep-water marine facility, product distribution terminals and refinery crude and product storage facilities with approximately 8.8 million barrels of shell capacity. 
 Inventory Intermediation Agreement 
 On October 25, 2021, PBF Holding and its subsidiaries, the PBF Entities, entered into the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron, pursuant to which the terms of the existing inventory intermediation agreements were amended and restated in their entirety, including, among other things, pricing and an extension of the terms. The Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement extends the term to December 31, 2024, which term may be further extended by mutual consent of the parties to December 31, 2025. On May 25, 2022, the PBF Entities entered into an amendment of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement to amend certain provisions thereof that related to and were impacted by amendments made on May 25, 2022 to the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 57 

Pursuant to the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron will continue to purchase and hold title to the J. Aron Products purchased or produced by the Refineries and delivered into the Storage Tanks. Furthermore, J. Aron agrees to sell the J. Aron Products back to PRC and DCR (and, at the election of the PBF Entities, Chalmette Refining) as the J. Aron Products are discharged out of the Storage Tanks. We exercised our right to include the Chalmette refinery under the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement in November 2021. J. Aron has the right to store the J. Aron Products purchased in tanks under the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement and will retain these storage rights for the term of the agreement. We intend to utilize the crude oil and will market and sell the refined products independently to third parties. 
 Renewable Fuel Standard 
 We are subject to obligations to purchase RINs required to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Our overall RINs obligation is based on a percentage of domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by EPA. To the degree we are unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy our RINs obligation, RINs must be purchased on the open market to avoid penalties and fines. We record our RINs obligation on a net basis in Accrued expenses when our RINs liability is greater than the amount of RINs earned and purchased in a given period and in Prepaid and other current assets when the amount of RINs earned and purchased is greater than the RINs liability. We incurred approximately 1,225.5 million in RINs costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 726.0 million and 326.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increases in RINs costs are due primarily to volatility in prices for ethanol-linked RINs and increases in our production of on-road transportation fuels. Our RINs purchase obligation is dependent on our actual shipment of on-road transportation fuels domestically and the amount of blending achieved.

Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Overview 
 Our earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price of refined products ultimately sold depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other refined products, which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in global and regional economies, weather conditions, global and regional political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels, pipeline capacity, prevailing exchange rates and the extent of government regulation. Our revenue and income from operations fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined product prices, our materials cost fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil prices and our other operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of energy to meet the power needs of our refineries. In addition, the effect of changes in crude oil prices on our operating results is influenced by how the prices of refined products adjust to reflect such changes. 
 Crude oil and other feedstock costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuation. Expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and installation of additional refinery distillation or conversion capacity, price volatility, governmental regulations, international political and economic developments and other factors beyond our control are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction or increase in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as for gasoline and diesel, during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter. 
 Benchmark Refining Margins 
 In assessing our operating performance, we compare the refining margins (revenue less materials cost) of each of our refineries against a specific benchmark industry refining margin based on crack spreads. Benchmark refining margins take into account both crude and refined product prices. When these prices are combined in a formula they provide a single value a gross margin per barrel that, when multiplied by throughput, provides an approximation of the gross margin generated by refining activities. 
 The performance of our East Coast refineries generally follows the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Toledo refinery generally follows the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Chalmette refinery generally follows the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Torrance refinery generally follows the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Martinez refinery generally follows the ANS (West Coast) 3-2-1 benchmark refining margin. 
 While the benchmark refinery margins presented below under Results of Operations Market Indicators are representative of the results of our refineries, each refinery s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis will differ from the benchmark due to a variety of factors affecting the performance of the relevant refinery to its corresponding benchmark. These factors include the refinery s actual type of crude oil throughput, product yield differentials and any other factors not reflected in the benchmark refining margins, such as transportation costs, storage costs, credit fees, fuel consumed during production and any product premiums or discounts, as well as inventory fluctuations, timing of crude oil and other feedstock purchases, a rising or declining crude and product pricing environment and commodity price management activities. As discussed in more detail below, each of our refineries, depending on market conditions, has certain feedstock-cost and product-value advantages and disadvantages as compared to the refinery s relevant benchmark. 
 59 

Credit Risk Management 
 Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to us. Our exposure to credit risk is reflected in the carrying amount of the receivables that are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. To minimize credit risk, all customers are subject to extensive credit verification procedures and extensions of credit above defined thresholds are to be approved by the senior management. Our intention is to trade only with recognized creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. We also limit the risk of bad debts by obtaining security such as guarantees or letters of credit. 
 We continually monitor our market risk exposure for market developments which could introduce significant volatility in the financial markets. 
 Other Factors 
 We currently source our crude oil for our refineries on a global basis through a combination of market purchases and short-term purchase contracts, and through our crude oil supply agreements. We believe purchases based on market pricing has given us flexibility in obtaining crude oil at lower prices and on a more accurate as needed basis. Since our East Coast refineries access their crude slates from the Delaware River via ship or barge and through our rail facilities at Delaware City, these refineries have the flexibility to purchase crude oils from the Mid-Continent and Western Canada, as well as a number of different countries. We have not sourced crude oil under our crude supply arrangement with Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. PDVSA since 2017 as PDVSA has suspended deliveries due to our inability to agree to mutually acceptable payment terms and because of U.S. government sanctions against PDVSA. 
 Currently, crude oil delivered by rail is consumed at our East Coast refineries. The PBFX Delaware City rail unloading facilities, and the East Coast Storage Assets, allow our East Coast refineries to source WTI-based crude oils from Western Canada and the Mid-Continent, which we believe, at times, may provide cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based international crude oils. In support of this rail strategy, we have at times entered into agreements to lease or purchase crude railcars. Certain of these railcars were subsequently sold to a third-party, which has leased the railcars back to us for periods of between four and seven years. In subsequent periods, we have sold or returned railcars to optimize our railcar portfolio. Our railcar fleet, at times, provides transportation flexibility within our crude oil sourcing strategy that allows our East Coast refineries to process cost advantaged crude from Canada and the Mid-Continent. 
 Our operating cost structure is also important to our profitability. Major operating costs include costs relating to employees and contract labor, energy, maintenance and environmental compliance and emission control regulations, including the cost of RINs required for compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard. The predominant variable cost is energy, in particular, the price of utilities, natural gas and electricity. 
 Our operating results are also affected by the reliability of our refinery operations. Unplanned downtime of our refinery assets generally results in lost margin opportunity and increased maintenance expense. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as major turnaround maintenance, is managed through a planning process that considers such things as the margin environment, the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance and feed logistics, whereas unplanned downtime does not afford us this opportunity.

Refinery-Specific Information 
 The following section includes refinery-specific information related to our operations, crude oil differentials, ancillary costs, and local premiums and discounts. 
 East Coast Refining System (Delaware City and Paulsboro Refineries). The benchmark refining margin for the East Coast Refining System is calculated by assuming that two barrels of Dated Brent crude oil are converted into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of diesel. We calculate this benchmark using the NYH market value of reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending RBOB and ULSD against the market value of Dated Brent and refer to the benchmark as the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. The East Coast Refining System has a product slate of approximately 39 gasoline, 37 distillate, 2 high-value Group I lubricants, 1 high-value petrochemicals, with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (3 LPGs, 12 black oil and 6 other). For this reason, we believe the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of East Coast refining revenues are generated off NYH-based market prices. 
 The East Coast Refining System s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis is projected to differ from the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors: 
 the system processes a slate of primarily medium and heavy sour crude oils, which has constituted approximately 60 to 75 of total throughput. The remaining throughput consists of sweet crude oil and other feedstocks and blendstocks. In addition, we have the capability to process a significant volume of light, sweet crude oil depending on market conditions. Our total throughput costs have historically priced at a discount to Dated Brent; and 
 as a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at our East Coast Refining System, we produce lower value products including sulfur, carbon dioxide and petroleum coke. These products are priced at a significant discount to RBOB and ULSD. 
 the Paulsboro refinery produces Group I lubricants which carry a premium sales price to RBOB and ULSD and the black oil is sold as asphalt which may be sold at a premium or discount to Dated Brent based on the market. 
 Toledo Refinery. The benchmark refining margin for the Toledo refinery is calculated by assuming that four barrels of WTI crude oil are converted into three barrels of gasoline, one-half barrel of ULSD and one-half barrel of jet fuel. We calculate this refining margin using the Chicago market values of CBOB and ULSD and the United States Gulf Coast value of jet fuel against the market value of WTI and refer to this benchmark as the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Toledo refinery has a product slate of approximately 51 gasoline, 36 distillate, 5 high-value petrochemicals (including nonene, tetramer, benzene, xylene and toluene) with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (5 LPGs, and 3 black oil). For this reason, we believe the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Toledo revenues are generated off Chicago-based market prices. 
 The Toledo refinery s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors: 
 the Toledo refinery processes a slate of domestic sweet and Canadian synthetic crude oil. Historically, Toledo s blended average crude costs have differed from the market value of WTI crude oil; 
 the Toledo refinery configuration enables it to produce more barrels of product than throughput which generates a pricing benefit; and 
 the Toledo refinery generates a pricing benefit on some of its refined products, primarily its petrochemicals. 
 61 

Chalmette Refinery. The benchmark refining margin for the Chalmette refinery is calculated by assuming two barrels of LLS crude oil are converted into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of diesel. We calculate this benchmark using the US Gulf Coast market value of 87 conventional gasoline and ULSD against the market value of LLS and refer to this benchmark as the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Chalmette refinery has a product slate of approximately 44 gasoline and 36 distillate, 1 high-value petrochemicals with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (7 black oil, 5 LPGs, 3 petroleum coke and 4 other). For this reason, we believe the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Chalmette revenues are generated off Gulf Coast-based market prices. 
 The Chalmette refinery s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors: 
 the Chalmette refinery has generally processed a slate of primarily medium and heavy sour crude oils, which has historically constituted approximately 50 to 75 of total throughput. The remaining throughput consists of sweet crude oil and other feedstocks and blendstocks; and 
 as a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Chalmette, we produce lower-value products including sulfur and petroleum coke. These products are priced at a significant discount to 87 conventional gasoline and ULSD. 
 Torrance Refinery. The benchmark refining margin for the Torrance refinery is calculated by assuming that four barrels of ANS crude oil are converted into three barrels of gasoline, one-half barrel of diesel and one-half barrel of jet fuel. We calculate this benchmark using the West Coast Los Angeles market value of California reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending CARBOB ), CARB diesel and jet fuel and refer to the benchmark as the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Torrance refinery has a product slate of approximately 56 gasoline and 27 distillate with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (3 LPG, 3 black oil and 11 other). For this reason, we believe the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Torrance revenues are generated off West Coast Los Angeles-based market prices. 
 The Torrance refinery s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors: 
 the Torrance refinery has generally processed a slate of primarily heavy sour crude oils, which has historically constituted approximately 70 to 90 of total throughput. The Torrance crude slate has the lowest API gravity (typically an API gravity of less than 20 degrees) of all of our refineries. The remaining throughput consists of other feedstocks and blendstocks; and 
 as a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Torrance, we produce lower-value products including petroleum coke and sulfur. These products are priced at a significant discount to gasoline and diesel. 
 62 

Martinez Refinery . The benchmark refining margin for the Martinez refinery is calculated by assuming that three barrels of ANS crude oil are converted into two barrels of gasoline, one-quarter barrel of diesel and three-quarter barrel of jet fuel. We calculate this benchmark using the West Coast San Francisco market value of CARBOB, CARB diesel and jet fuel and refer to the benchmark as the ANS (West Coast) 3-2-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Martinez refinery has a product slate of approximately 54 gasoline and 35 distillate with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (2 black oil petroleum coke, 4 LPG and 5 other). For this reason, we believe the ANS (West Coast) 3-2-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Martinez revenues are generated off West Coast San Francisco-based market prices. 
 The Martinez refinery s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors: 
 the Martinez refinery has generally processed a slate of primarily heavy sour crude oils, which has historically constituted approximately 70 to 90 of total throughput. The remaining throughput consists of other feedstocks and blendstocks; and 
 as a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Martinez, we produce lower-value products including petroleum coke and sulfur. These products are priced at a significant discount to gasoline and CARB diesel.

 2022 Compared to 2021 
 Overview Our net income was 3,708.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of 239.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 were negatively impacted by special items consisting of a net loss on the extinguishment of debt mainly associated with the redemption of our 2025 Senior Secured Notes of 66.1 million and a net change in the fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 48.1 million. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 were positively impacted by special items consisting of a non-cash LCM inventory adjustment of approximately 669.6 million and a gain on the extinguishment of debt associated with the repurchase of a portion of our 2028 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes of 79.9 million, offset by charges associated with the change in the fair value of the Martinez Contingent Consideration of 29.4 million. 
 66 

Excluding the impact of these special items, when comparing our results to the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced an increase in the demand for our refined products, evidenced by higher throughput volumes and barrels sold at all of our refineries, as well as overall stronger refining margins due to favorable movements in crack spreads and crude oil differentials. These improving metrics have positively impacted our revenues, gross margin and operating income. 
 Revenues Revenues totaled 46.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 27.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 19.6 billion or 72.1 . Revenues per barrel sold were 123.12 and 80.64 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 52.7 directly related to higher hydrocarbon commodity prices. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 300,300 bpd, 148,500 bpd, 180,700 bpd and 295,600 bpd, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 250,900 bpd, 134,100 bpd, 163,300 bpd and 286,200 bpd, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 353,800 bpd, 158,200 bpd, 190,600 bpd and 338,400 bpd, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and West Coast refineries averaged approximately 292,500 bpd, 142,600 bpd, 170,400 bpd and 318,700 bpd, respectively. 
 Overall average throughput rates were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we operated our refineries at reduced rates and periodically increased the throughput rates across our entire refining system to correlate with the gradual increases in demand experienced throughout the year. Overall average throughput in 2022 remained high as a result of sustained increases in demand and favorable market conditions. Total refined product barrels sold were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales from inventory as well as sales and purchases of refined products outside our refineries. 
 Consolidated Gross Margin Consolidated gross margin totaled 4,467.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 672.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 3,794.5 million. Gross refining margin (as described below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures) totaled 7,429.9 million, or 22.00 per barrel of throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3,087.7 million, or 10.14 per barrel of throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 4,342.2 million. Gross refining margin excluding special items totaled 7,429.9 million, or 22.00 per barrel of throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2,418.1 million, or 7.94 per barrel of throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 5,011.8 million. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, our margin calculations were not impacted by special items. Consolidated gross margin and gross refining margin increased due to favorable movements in certain crack spreads and crude oil differentials and higher throughput volumes and barrels sold at all of our refineries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our margin calculations included a favorable special item related to a non-cash LCM inventory adjustment of approximately 669.6 million on a net basis resulting from the increase in crude oil and refined product prices from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Additionally, our results continue to be impacted by significant costs to comply with the RFS. Total RFS costs were 1,225.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 726.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Average industry margins were favorable during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased refining margins as a result of sustained demand and global supply disruptions. 
 67 

Favorable movements in these benchmark crude differentials typically result in lower crude costs and positively impact our earnings, while reductions in these benchmark crude differentials typically result in higher crude costs and negatively impact our earnings. 
 On the East Coast, the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately 40.26 per barrel, or 139.1 higher, in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 16.84 per barrel in the same period in 2021. Our margins were positively impacted from our refinery specific slate on the East Coast by strengthened Dated Brent/Maya differential, which increased by 7.48 per barrel, offset by weakened WTI/Bakken differential, which decreased by 3.91 per barrel compared to the same period in 2021. The WTI/WCS differential increased to 21.30 per barrel in 2022 compared to 14.19 per barrel in 2021, which favorably impacted our cost of heavy Canadian crude. 
 Across the Mid-Continent, the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was 31.56 per barrel, or 93.1 higher, in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 16.34 per barrel in the prior year. Our margins were negatively impacted from our refinery specific slate in the Mid-Continent by a decreasing WTI/Bakken differential, which averaged a premium of 4.05 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a premium of 0.14 per barrel in the prior year. Additionally, the WTI/Syncrude differential averaged a premium of 3.04 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a discount of 2.25 per barrel in the prior year. 
 On the Gulf Coast, the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was 37.56 per barrel, or 134.3 higher, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 16.03 per barrel in the prior year. Margins on the Gulf Coast were negatively impacted from our refinery specific slate by a weakening WTI/LLS differential, which averaged a premium of 2.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a premium of 1.50 per barrel in the prior year. 
 On the West Coast, the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was 41.64 per barrel, or 107.2 higher, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 20.10 per barrel in the prior year. Additionally, the ANS (West Coast) 3-2-1 industry crack spread was 41.89 per barrel, or 103.8 higher, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 20.55 per barrel in the prior year. Our margins on the West Coast were negatively impacted from our refinery specific slate by a weakening WTI/ANS differential, which averaged a premium of 4.17 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a premium of 2.46 per barrel in the prior year. 
 Operating Expenses Operating expenses totaled 2,495.6 million, or 7.39 per barrel of throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,999.1 million, or 6.56 per barrel of throughput, for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 496.5 million, or 24.8 . The increase in operating expenses was mainly attributable to increases in natural gas volumes and price across our refineries when compared to the prior year. Additionally, we experienced higher outside services, maintenance and operational costs due to increased production. 
 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled 438.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 226.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 212.1 million or 93.7 . The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily related to higher employee-related expenses, certain of which includes the recognition of incentive compensation. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of personnel, facilities and other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries and related logistics assets. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 474.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including 466.9 million recorded within Cost of sales) compared to 429.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (including 415.7 million recorded within Cost of sales), an increase of 45.4 million. The increase was a result of a general increase in our fixed asset base due to capital projects and turnarounds completed since the end of the prior year. 
 68 

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration, net Change in fair value of contingent consideration represented a loss of 48.1 million and a loss of 29.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These losses were primarily related to the changes in estimated fair value of the earn-out liability associated with the acquisition of the Martinez refinery, offset by the recognition of contingent assets associated with the acquisition. 
 Loss (Gain) on Sale of Assets There was a loss of 0.9 million and a gain of 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, related primarily to the sale of non-operating refinery assets. 
 Change in Fair Value of Catalyst Obligations Change in fair value of catalyst obligations represented a loss of 2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a gain of 8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These losses and gains relate to the change in fair value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries precious metal catalysts, which we are obligated to repurchase at fair market value upon lease termination. 
 (Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt We incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 66.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the redemption of all of the outstanding 2025 Senior Secured Notes, slightly offset by a gain related to the repurchase of a portion of our 2028 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. We incurred a gain on extinguishment of debt of 79.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the repurchase of a portion of our 2028 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. 
 Interest Expense, net Interest expense totaled 206.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 275.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 68.2 million. This net decrease is mainly attributable to the redemption of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes during the third quarter of 2022, as well as lower outstanding balances on our Revolving Credit Facility. Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt, costs related to the sale and leaseback of our precious metal catalysts, financing costs associated with the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron, letter of credit fees associated with the purchase of certain crude oils and the amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 Income Tax Expense As we are a limited liability company treated as a flow-through entity for income tax purposes, our consolidated financial statements generally do not include a benefit or expense for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, apart from the income tax attributable to two subsidiaries acquired in connection with the acquisition of our Chalmette refinery and our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, PBF Energy Limited PBF Ltd. ). These subsidiaries are treated as C-Corporations for income tax purposes. An income tax benefit of 2.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 in comparison to income tax benefit of 14.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to the results of PBF Ltd.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP Non-GAAP ). These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. 
 Special Items 
 The Non-GAAP measures presented include gross refining margin excluding special items, and EBITDA excluding special items. Special items for the periods presented relate to LCM inventory adjustments, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of hydrogen plants, severance and reconfiguration costs, impairment expense, gains on land sales, charges associated with the early return of certain leased railcars, turnaround acceleration costs, and a LIFO inventory decrement. See Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more details on all special items disclosed. Although we believe that Non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of special items, provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and performance of our business and allow for helpful period-over-period comparisons, such Non-GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 70 

Gross Refining Margin and Gross Refining Margin Excluding Special Items 
 Gross refining margin is defined as consolidated gross margin excluding refinery depreciation and operating expense related to the refineries. We believe both gross refining margin and gross refining margin excluding special items are important measures of operating performance and provide useful information to investors because they are helpful metric comparisons to the industry refining margin benchmarks, as the refining margin benchmarks do not include a charge for refinery operating expenses and depreciation. In order to assess our operating performance, we compare our gross refining margin (revenues less cost of products and other) to industry refining margin benchmarks and crude oil prices as defined in the table below. 
 Neither gross refining margin nor gross refining margin excluding special items should be considered an alternative to consolidated gross margin, income from operations, net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross refining margin and gross refining margin excluding special items presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently. 
 The following table presents our GAAP calculation of gross margin and a reconciliation of gross refining margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, consolidated gross margin, on a historical basis, as applicable, for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except per barrel amounts): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 per barrel of throughput per barrel of throughput per barrel of throughput Calculation of consolidated gross margin: Revenues 46,780.6 138.55 27,202.0 89.30 15,045.0 56.49 Less: Cost of sales 42,313.2 125.32 26,529.1 87.08 16,881.4 63.39 Consolidated gross margin 4,467.4 13.23 672.9 2.22 (1,836.4) (6.90) Reconciliation of consolidated gross margin to gross refining margin: Consolidated gross margin 4,467.4 13.23 672.9 2.22 (1,836.4) (6.90) Add: Refinery operating expense 2,495.6 7.39 1,999.1 6.56 1,835.2 6.89 Add: Refinery depreciation expense 466.9 1.38 415.7 1.36 498.0 1.87 Gross refining margin 7,429.9 22.00 3,087.7 10.14 496.8 1.86 Special Items: (1)

EBITDA, EBITDA Excluding Special Items and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our management uses EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our Board of Directors, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. Our outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and other contractual obligations also include similar measures as a basis for certain covenants under those agreements which may differ from the Adjusted EBITDA definition described below. 
 EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our computation of EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA contains some, but not all, adjustments that are taken into account in the calculation of the components of various covenants in the agreements governing our senior notes and other credit facilities. EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to income from operations or net income as measures of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA are not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before adjustments for items such as stock-based compensation expense, change in the fair value of catalyst obligations, gain on sale of hydrogen plants, the write down of inventory to the LCM, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt related to refinancing activities, change in the fair value of contingent consideration and certain other non-cash items. 
 Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA also have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items and Adjusted EBITDA: 
 do not reflect depreciation expense or our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; 
 do not reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from certain hedging activities, which may have a substantial impact on our cash flow; 
 do not reflect certain other non-cash income and expenses; and 
 exclude income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following notes are applicable to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures above: 
 (1) Special items: 
 LCM Inventory Adjustment - LCM is a GAAP requirement related to inventory valuation that mandates inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the LIFO inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market is determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and an LCM inventory adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the current period. The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments are included in income from operations, but are excluded from the operating results presented, as applicable, in order to make such information comparable between periods. 
 The following table includes the LCM inventory reserve as of each date presented (in millions): 
 2022 2021 2020 January 1, 669.6 401.6 December 31, 669.6 
 The following table includes the corresponding impact of changes in the LCM inventory reserve on income (loss) from operations and net income (loss) for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net LCM inventory adjustment benefit (charge) in both income (loss) from operations and net income (loss) 669.6 (268.0) 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration, net - During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net change in fair value of contingent consideration related to changes in the estimated fair value of the earn-out liability associated with the acquisition of the Martinez refinery, offset by the recognition of contingent assets associated with the acquisition. These changes resulted in decreases to income from operations and net income by 48.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Martinez Contingent Consideration which decreased income from operations and net income by 29.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Martinez Contingent Consideration which increased income from operations and net income by 79.3 million. 
 Gain on Sale of Hydrogen Plants - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on the sale of five hydrogen plants. The gain increased income from operations and net income by 471.1 million. There were no such gains in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 74 

Gain on Land Sales - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on sale of one separate parcel of real property acquired as part of the Torrance refinery, but not part of the refinery itself, which increased income from operations and net income by 8.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such gains in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 Impairment Expense - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge which decreased income from operations and net income by 91.8 million, resulting from the write-down of certain assets as a result of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration and project abandonments. There were no such impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 LIFO Inventory Decrement - As part of our overall reduction in throughput in 2020 and our reduction in inventory volume as of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a charge to cost of products and other related to a LIFO inventory layer decrement. The majority of the decrement related to our East Coast LIFO inventory layer and the reduction to our East Coast inventory experienced as part of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration. These charges decreased income from operations and net income by 83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Decrements recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were not significant. 
 Turnaround Acceleration Costs - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we accelerated the recognition of turnaround amortization associated with units that were temporarily idled as part of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration. These costs decreased income from operations and net income by 56.2 million. There were no such costs in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 Severance and Reconfiguration Costs - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded severance charges related to reductions in our workforce which decreased income from operations and net income by 24.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded reconfiguration charges related to the temporary idling of certain assets as part of our East Coast Refining System which decreased income from operations and net income by 5.3 million. There were no such costs in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 Early Return of Railcars - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized certain expenses within Cost of sales associated with the voluntary early return of certain leased railcars which decreased income from operations and net income by 12.5 million. There were no such expenses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 Loss (Gain) on Extinguishment of Debt - During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt which decreased income before income taxes and net income by 66.1 million primarily related to the redemption of our 2025 Senior Secured Notes, partially offset by the repurchase of a portion of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of a portion of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes, which increased net income by 79.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded debt extinguishment costs related to the redemption of the 2023 Senior Notes which decreased net income by 22.2 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability under our credit facilities, as described below. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our and our subsidiaries capital expenditures, working capital needs, future distributions and debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations depends, in part, on petroleum oil market pricing and general economic, political and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2022, we are in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, in all our debt agreements. 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 4,696.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 292.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 ____________________________ 
 
 (1) Refer to Note 8 - Credit Facilities and Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure related to debt. 
 (2) Total Capitalization refers to the sum of debt plus total equity. 
 
 2022 Debt Related Transactions 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we exercised our rights under the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Secured Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2025 Senior Secured Notes at a price of 104.625 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate redemption price for all 2025 Senior Secured Notes approximated 1.3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest. The difference between the carrying value of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on the date they were redeemed and the amount for which they were redeemed was 69.9 million and was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In addition, we made a number of open market repurchases of our 2028 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes that resulted in the extinguishment of 24.9 million in principal of the 2028 Senior Notes and 5.0 million in principal of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amount outstanding of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes, excluding accrued interest, totaled 25.9 million and we recognized a 3.8 million gain on this extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 78 

On May 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment of our Revolving Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Revolving Credit Agreement amended and extended the Revolving Credit Facility through January 2025 and increased the maximum commitment to 4.3 billion through May 2023 (currently set to adjust to 2.75 billion in May 2023 through January 2025). The amendments also redefine certain components of the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Revolving credit Agreement) to reflect the existence of the two tranches, Tranche A Commitments and Tranche B Commitments. The Tranche A Commitments total 1.55 billion and the Tranche B Commitments total 2.75 billion. The amendments also include changes to incorporate the adoption of SOFR as a replacement of LIBOR, changes to joint lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and other titles, and other changes related to the foregoing. In addition, an accordion feature allows for additional Tranche B Commitments of up to an additional 500.0 million plus an amount equal to the Tranche A Commitments for existing Tranche A lenders. 
 During 2022, we also settled certain of our precious metals financing arrangements, resulting in a reduction of debt of approximately 56.2 million. 
 Revolving Credit Facilities Overview 
 One of our primary sources of liquidity are borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, which had the following available capacity at December 31, 2022 (in millions): 
 Total Commitment Amount Borrowed as of December 31, 2022 Outstanding Letters of Credit Borrowing Base Availability Expiration Date Revolving Credit Facility (a) 4,300.0 576.1 4,300.0 January 2025 
 ___________________________ 
 (a) The amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated according to a borrowing base formula based on (i) 90 of the book value of Eligible Accounts with respect to investment grade obligors plus (ii) 85 of the book value of Eligible Accounts with respect to non-investment grade obligors plus (iii) 80 of the cost of Eligible Hydrocarbon Inventory plus (iv) 100 of Cash and Cash Equivalents in deposit accounts subject to a control agreement, in each case as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and in any event cannot exceed 4.3 billion. 
 Additional Information on Indebtedness 
 Our debt, including our Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes, include certain typical financial covenants and restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee new debt, engage in certain business activities including transactions with affiliates and asset sales, make investments or distributions, engage in mergers or pay dividends in certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. We are in compliance as of December 31, 2022 with all covenants, including financial covenants, in all of our debt agreements. For further discussion of our indebtedness and these covenants and restrictions, see Note 8 - Credit Facilities and Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Liquidity 
 As of December 31, 2022, our operational liquidity was more than 4.9 billion (more than 2.4 billion as of December 31, 2021), which consists of 2.1 billion of cash and more than 2.8 billion of borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, which includes our cash on hand. 
 We are actively monitoring the ongoing volatility in the global oil markets and we continue to adjust our operational plans to the evolving market conditions. 
 
 79 

We may, at any time and from time to time, seek to continue to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt securities through cash purchases (and/or exchanges for equity or debt), in open-market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital, the trading prices of our debt securities, legal requirements and contractual restrictions and economic and market conditions. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. We are not obligated to repurchase any of our debt securities other than as set forth in the applicable indentures, and repurchases may be made or suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
 We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness, subject to the satisfaction of any debt incurrence and, if applicable, lien incurrence limitation covenants in our existing financing agreements. Although we were in compliance with incurrence covenants during the year ended December 31, 2022, to the extent that any of our activities triggered these covenants, there are no assurances that conditions could not change significantly, and that such changes could adversely impact our ability to meet some of these incurrence covenants at the time that we needed to. Failure to meet the incurrence covenants could impose certain incremental restrictions on, among other matters, our ability to incur new debt (including secured debt) and also may limit the extent to which we make new investments, repurchase our outstanding debt or incur new liens. 
 Working Capital 
 Working capital at December 31, 2022 was approximately 1,715.3 million, consisting of 6,494.5 million in total current assets and 4,779.2 million in total current liabilities. Working capital at December 31, 2021 was 1,266.5 million, consisting of 5,158.6 million in total current assets and 3,892.1 million in total current liabilities. 
 Crude and Feedstock Supply Agreements 
 Certain of our purchases of crude oil under our agreements with foreign national oil companies require that we post letters of credit, if open terms are exceeded, and arrange for shipment. We pay for the crude when invoiced, at which time any applicable letters of credit are lifted. We have a contract with Saudi Aramco pursuant to which we have been purchasing up to approximately 100,000 bpd of crude oil from Saudi Aramco that is processed at our Paulsboro refinery. In connection with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery we entered into a contract with PDVSA for the supply of 40,000 to 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at any of our East or Gulf Coast refineries. We have not sourced crude oil under this agreement since 2017 when PDVSA suspended deliveries due to the parties inability to agree to mutually acceptable payment terms and because of U.S. government sanctions against PDVSA . Notwithstanding the suspension, the U. S. government sanctions imposed against PDVSA and Venezuela prevented us from purchasing crude oil under this agreement. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Torrance refinery, we entered into a crude supply agreement with ExxonMobil for approximately 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at our Torrance refinery. We currently purchase all of our crude and feedstock needs independently from a variety of suppliers on the spot market or through term agreements for our Delaware City and Toledo refineries. 
 We currently have various crude supply agreements with terms through 2025 with Shell Oil Products for approximately 145,000 bpd, in the aggregate, to support our West Coast and Mid-Continent refinery operations. In addition, we have certain offtake agreements for our West Coast system with the same counterparty for clean products with varying terms up to 15 years. 
 80 

Inventory Intermediation Agreement 
 On October 25, 2021, we and the PBF Entities, entered into the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron, pursuant to which the terms of the previous inventory intermediation agreements were amended and restated in their entirety, including, among other things pricing and an extension of terms. The Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement extends the term to December 31, 2024, which term may be further extended by mutual consent of the parties to December 31, 2025. If not extended or replaced, at expiration, we will be required to repurchase the inventories outstanding under the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement at that time. On May 25, 2022, the PBF Entities entered into an amendment of the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement to amend certain provisions thereof that related to and were impacted by amendments made on May 25, 2022 to the Revolving Credit Agreement. We intend to either extend or replace the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement prior to its expiration. 
 At December 31, 2022, the LIFO value of the J. Aron Products included within Inventories in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was 181.8 million. We accrue a corresponding liability for such crude oil, intermediates and finished products. 
 Capital Spending 
 Capital spending was 1,003.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was primarily comprised of annual maintenance and turnaround costs at our Delaware City, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries in addition to spending related to our Renewable Diesel Project for a renewable fuels production facility co-located at our Chalmette refinery. Capital spending also included costs associated with safety related enhancements and facility improvements at our refineries. Excluding capital expenditures related to our Renewable Diesel Project, we currently expect to spend an aggregate of approximately 700.0 million to 750.0 million during 2023 for facility improvements and refinery maintenance and turnarounds, as well as expenditures to meet environmental, regulatory and safety requirements. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, we invested approximately 140 million in capital related to our Renewable Diesel Project. We currently anticipate remaining capital expenditures to complete the project to range from 200.0 million to 250.0 million in 2023 with the goal of commencing production in the first half of 2023. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our material cash requirements include the following known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 that are expected to be paid within the next year and thereafter (in millions). 
 Payments Due by Period Short-Term Long-Term Total Credit facilities and debt (a) 
 4.0 1,466.1 1,470.1 Interest payments on credit facilities and debt 97.2 295.4 392.6 Leases and other rental-related commitments (b) 
 411.1 2,331.0 2,742.1 Purchase obligations (c) 
 9,006.3 8,300.5 17,306.8 Minimum volume commitments with PBFX (d) 
 100.2 186.7 286.9 Construction obligations 166.0 166.0 Environmental obligations (e) 
 13.9 149.0 162.9 Pension and post-retirement obligations (f) 
 26.5 300.4 326.9 Martinez Contingent Consideration (g) 
 100.0 73.7 173.7 Total material cash requirements 9,925.2 13,102.8 23,028.0 
 81 

(a) Credit facilities and debt 
 Credit facilities and debt represent (i) the repayment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the 2025 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes; and (ii) the repayment of our catalyst financing obligations on their maturity dates. With the exception of our catalyst financing obligations, we have no debt maturing before 2024. 
 Refer to Note 8 - Credit Facilities and Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure related to debt. 
 (b) Leases and other rental-related commitments 
 Operating and Finance lease obligations include options to extend terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We have entered into certain agreements for the supply of hydrogen that contain both lease and non-lease components. The table above also includes such non-lease components of these agreements. See Note 12 - Leases of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and disclosures regarding our operating and finance lease obligations. 
 We also enter into contractual obligations with third parties for the right to use property for locating pipelines and accessing certain of our assets (also referred to as land easements) in the normal course of business. Our obligations regarding such land easements are included within Leases and other rental-related commitments in the table above. 
 (c) Purchase obligations 
 Purchase obligations include commitments to purchase crude oil from certain counterparties under supply agreements, contracts for the transportation of crude oil and supply of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, chemicals, steam, or natural gas to certain of our refineries, contracts for the treatment of wastewater, contracts for pipeline capacity, and forward purchase commitments to acquire AB 32, RINs or LCFS credits from third parties. Additionally, we have obligations to repurchase the J. Aron Products under the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron as further explained in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 4 - Inventories and Note 7 - Accrued Expenses of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The amounts included in this table exclude our crude supply agreement with PDVSA. We have not sourced crude oil under this agreement since the third quarter of 2017 as PDVSA has suspended deliveries due to the parties inability to agree to mutually acceptable payment terms and because of U.S. government sanctions against PDVSA. 
 (d) Minimum volume commitments with PBFX 
 We have minimum obligations under our commercial agreements entered into with PBFX. Refer to Note 10 - Related Party Transactions and Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed explanation of each of these agreements and quantification of minimum amounts due in subsequent periods, respectively. 
 Included in the table above are our obligations related to the minimum volume commitments required under these commercial agreements that were determined to not be leases under GAAP. Any incremental volumes above any minimum throughput under these agreements would increase our obligations. Our obligation with respect to certain crude oil and refined product storage agreements is based on the estimated shell capacity of the storage tanks to be utilized. 
 82 

(e) Environmental obligations 
 In connection with certain of our refinery acquisitions, we have assumed certain environmental remediation obligations to address matters that were outstanding at the time of such acquisitions. In addition, in connection with most of these acquisitions, we have purchased environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each site. The obligations in the table above reflect our undiscounted best estimate in cost and tenure to remediate our outstanding obligations and are further discussed in Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (f) Pension and post-retirement obligations 
 Pension and post-retirement obligations include only those amounts we expect to pay out in benefit payments and are further explained in Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (g) Martinez Contingent Consideration 
 Contingent consideration includes our obligations to pay certain contractual earn-outs entered into as part of the acquisition. Our earn-out obligation related to the Martinez Acquisition includes the estimated undiscounted contingent consideration amounts payable to Shell Oil Products related to annual refinery earnings in 2022 and 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes. 
 Inventory 
 Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of crude oil, feedstocks, blendstocks and refined products is determined under the LIFO method using the dollar value LIFO method with increments valued based on average cost during the year. The cost of supplies and other inventories is determined principally on the weighted average cost method. In addition, the use of the LIFO inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with LIFO inventory costs generated in prior periods. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the replacement value of inventories exceeded the LIFO carrying value. The LCM or market inventory valuation reserve, or a portion thereof, is subject to reversal as a reduction to cost of products sold in subsequent periods as inventories giving rise to the reserve are sold, and a new reserve is established. Such a reduction to cost of products sold could be significant if inventory values return to historical cost price levels. Additionally, further decreases in overall inventory values could result in additional charges to cost of products sold should the LCM or market inventory valuation reserve be increased. 
 
 83 

Environmental Matters 
 Liabilities for future clean-up costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-up efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for periodic assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties. While we believe that our current estimates of the amounts and timing of the costs related to the remediation of these liabilities are reasonable, we have had limited prior exposure to certain of these environmental obligations due to our short operating history with certain of our assets. It is possible that our estimates of the costs and duration of the environmental remediation activities related to these liabilities could materially change. 
 Business Combinations 
 We use the acquisition method of accounting for the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, we obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. 
 Certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration, subsequent to the measurement period, will be recognized as earnings in the period in which it occurs. Such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. Changes to the estimate of expected future contingent consideration payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience. While we believe that our current estimate of the fair value of our contingent consideration liability is reasonable, it is possible that the actual future settlement of our earn-out obligations could materially differ. 
 Deferred Turnaround Costs 
 Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at our refineries, are capitalized when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated until the next turnaround occurs (generally three to six years). While we believe that the estimates of time until the next turnaround are reasonable, it should be noted that factors such as competition, regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting amortization expense in the future. 
 84 

Derivative Instruments 
 We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to changes in commodity prices for the crude oil and feedstocks used in the refining process, as well as the prices of the refined products sold and the risk associated with the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. The accounting treatment for commodity and environmental compliance contracts depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract meets the definition of a derivative. Non-derivative contracts are recorded at the time of delivery. 
 All derivative instruments that are not designated as normal purchases or sales are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that either are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or normal purchase or normal sale accounting are recognized in income. Contracts qualifying for the normal purchases and sales exemption are accounted for upon settlement. We elect fair value hedge accounting for certain derivatives associated with our inventory repurchase obligations. 
 Derivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives; determination of the fair value of derivatives; identification of hedge relationships; assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness; and election and designation of the normal purchases and sales exemption. All of these judgments, depending upon their timing and effect, can have a significant impact on earnings. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment on a continual basis and reassess the reasonableness of their related useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant assessment. Possible triggering events may include, among other things, significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, environmental regulations or a determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or an asset group will be sold or retired before its estimated useful life. These possible triggering events of impairment may impact our assumptions related to future throughput levels, future operating revenues, expenses and gross margin, levels of anticipated capital expenditures and remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. Cash flows for long-lived assets/asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. The cash flows from the refinery asset groups are evaluated individually regardless of product mix or fuel type produced. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods. Our assumptions incorporate inherent uncertainties that are at times difficult to predict and could result in impairment charges or accelerated depreciation in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions used.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Our primary commodity price risk is associated with the difference between the prices we sell our refined products and the prices we pay for crude oil and other feedstocks. We may use derivative instruments to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil and refined products, natural gas, interest rates, or to capture market opportunities. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our earnings, cash flow and liquidity are significantly affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and natural gas. The supply of and demand for these commodities depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, planned and unplanned downtime in refineries, pipelines and production facilities, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive and alternative fuels, and the extent of government regulation. As a result, the prices of these commodities can be volatile. Our revenues fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined product prices, our cost of sales fluctuates significantly with movements in crude oil and feedstock prices and our operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to these commodity price risks through our supply and offtake agreements as well as through the use of various commodity derivative instruments. 
 We may use non-trading derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and feedstocks, finished products and natural gas outside of our supply and offtake agreements. The derivative instruments we use include physical commodity contracts and exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial instruments. We mark-to-market our commodity derivative instruments and recognize the changes in their fair value in our statements of operations. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had gross open commodity derivative contracts representing 30.1 million barrels and 42.1 million barrels, respectively, with an unrealized net gain of 13.9 million and unrealized net loss of 12.0 million, respectively. The open commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022 expire at various times during 2023. 
 We carry inventories of crude oil, intermediates and refined products hydrocarbon inventories on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, the values of which are subject to fluctuations in market prices. Our hydrocarbon inventories totaled approximately 32.8 million barrels and 30.2 million barrels at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The average cost of our hydrocarbon inventories was approximately 80.04 and 78.29 per barrel on a LIFO basis at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the replacement value of inventory exceeded the LIFO carrying value. If market prices of our inventory decline to a level below our average cost, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our hydrocarbon inventories to market. 
 Our predominant variable operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of natural gas and electricity. We are therefore sensitive to movements in natural gas prices. Assuming normal operating conditions, we annually consume a total of between 75 million and 95 million MMBTUs of natural gas amongst our six refineries. Accordingly, a 1.00 per MMBTU change in natural gas prices would increase or decrease our natural gas costs by approximately 75.0 million to 95.0 million. 
 88 

Compliance Program Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to our obligations to buy and the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory compliance programs, which includes RINs, required to comply with the RFS. Our overall RINs obligation is based on a percentage of our domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by EPA. To the degree we are unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy our RINs obligation, we must purchase RINs on the open market. To mitigate the impact of the market risk relating to our obligations on our results of operations and cash flows, we may elect to purchase RINs or other environmental credits as part of our liability management strategy. 
 In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with complying with federal and state legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas and other emissions. Requirements to reduce emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs put in place. Compliance with such emission standards may require the purchase of emission credits or similar instruments. 
 Certain of these compliance contracts or instruments qualify as derivative instruments. For certain of these contracts, we elect the normal purchase normal sale exception under Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging, for such instruments, and therefore do not record these contracts at their fair value. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The maximum commitment under our Revolving Credit Facility is 4.3 billion. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest either at the Alternative Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or at the Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, all as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance in variable interest debt. If this facility was fully drawn, a 1.0 change in the interest rate would increase or decrease our interest expense by approximately 25.6 million annually. 
 We also have interest rate exposure in connection with our Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement under which we pay a time value of money charge based on LIBOR. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. We continue to closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with our credit policy. 
 Concentration Risk 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, only one customer, Shell, accounted for 10 or more of our revenues (approximately 14 and 15 , respectively). 
 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, only one customer, Shell, accounted for 10 or more of our total trade accounts receivable (approximately 19 and 26 , respectively).

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We conducted evaluations under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon these evaluations as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), the principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on such assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as permitted by Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K for non-accelerated filers. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To PBF Energy Inc., the Managing Member of PBF Holding Company LLC 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PBF Holding Company LLC and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimate Impairment Assessment of Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangibles refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on a continual basis and reassesses the reasonableness of their related useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant assessment. Possible triggering events may include, among other things, significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, environmental regulations, or a determination that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable, will be sold or retired before its estimated useful life. During 2022, increasing environmental regulation was assessed as a possible triggering event as it relates specifically to our refineries located in California. These possible triggering events of impairment may impact the Company s assumptions related to future throughput levels, future operating revenues, expenses and gross margin, levels of anticipated capital expenditures, asset retirement obligations and remaining useful life. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the carrying amount of long- lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no impairment loss related to long-lived assets has been recognized. 
 We identified the determination of possible triggering events for long-lived assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes when determining whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. This required a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to impairment indicators for long-lived assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the identification of possible circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are no longer recoverable, including controls over management s useful life, throughput levels, gross margin, operating expenses, and future levels of capital expenditures assumptions. 
 We compared management s evaluation of potential impairment indicators to our independent expectation by: 
 We performed searches for adverse general market and asset-specific environmental conditions, 
 We inquired of Management about the impact of macro-economic events, the pace of decarbonization and the energy transition, and new environmental regulations on the Company s forecasting of future cash flows, refining margins, future levels of capital expenditure and estimated useful lives, 
 We inspected minutes of the board of directors, the Company s public statements, operating plans, and market reports to identify any evidence that may contradict management s assumptions, and 
 We read relevant rules and regulations issued by federal, state, and local regulatory bodies, including staff reports, resolutions, other third-party filings, and other publicly available information to assess future levels of sustained capital expenditure and impact to future refinery throughput. 
 With the assistance of Environmental Specialists, we performed a public domain search to assess the impact of environmental regulatory laws on the company s operations.

, subject to certain renewal options as applicable. The Company considers those renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised in the determination of the lease term and initial measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Interest expense for finance leases is incurred based on the carrying value of the lease liability. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of the Company s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company must discount lease payments based on an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate.

 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 PBF Energy (the Company s indirect parent) entered into a tax receivable agreement with the PBF LLC Series A and PBF LLC Series B unitholders (the Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment by PBF Energy to such persons of an amount equal to of the amount of the benefits, if any, that PBF Energy is deemed to realize as a result of (i) increases in tax basis, as described below, and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the benefits deemed realized by PBF Energy will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of PBF Energy (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that PBF Energy would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of PBF LLC as a result of purchases or exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock and had PBF Energy not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless: (i) PBF Energy exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) PBF Energy breaches any of its material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or (iii) certain changes of control occur, in which case all obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally be accelerated and due as calculated under certain assumptions. 
 The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of PBF Energy and not of PBF LLC or PBF Holding. In general, PBF Energy expects to obtain funding for these annual payments from PBF LLC, primarily through tax distributions, which PBF LLC makes on a pro-rata basis to its owners. Such owners include PBF Energy, which holds a interest in PBF LLC as of December 31, 2022 as of December 31, 2021). PBF LLC generally obtains funding to pay its tax distributions by causing PBF Holding to distribute cash to PBF LLC and from distributions it receives from PBFX. As of December 31, 2022 PBF Energy recognized million liability for the Tax Receivable Agreement obligation, reflecting the estimate of the undiscounted amounts that PBF Energy expects to pay under the agreement, net of the impact of any deferred tax asset valuation allowance recognized in accordance with ASC 470, Income Taxes million as of December 31, 2021).

 Asphalt and blackoils Feedstocks and other Chemicals Lubricants Total Revenues 
 The majority of the Company s revenues are generated from the sale of refined products. These revenues are largely based on the current spot (market) prices of the products sold, which represent consideration specifically allocable to the products being sold on a given day, and the Company recognizes those revenues upon delivery and transfer of title to the products to our customers. The time at which delivery and transfer of title occurs is the point when the Company s control of the products is transferred to the Company s customers and when its performance obligation to its customers is fulfilled. Delivery and transfer of title are specifically agreed to between the Company and customers within the contracts. The Company also has contracts which contain fixed pricing, tiered pricing, minimum volume features with makeup periods, or other factors that have not materially been affected by ASC 606.

 The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received or are due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenue was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The period between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant (i.e. generally within two months).
