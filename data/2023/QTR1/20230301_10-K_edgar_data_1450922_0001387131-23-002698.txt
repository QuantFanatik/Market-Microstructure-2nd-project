The
purpose of the abrdn Silver ETF Trust (known as Aberdeen Standard Silver ETF Trust prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust is to own silver transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust Shares ). Each Share represents
a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist solely of silver
bullion. The Trust was formed on July 20, 2009 when an initial Creation and was made in exchange for the issuance of two
Baskets (a Basket consists of 50,000 Shares). 

The
sponsor of the Trust is abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC (known as Aberdeen Standard ETFs Sponsor LLC prior to March 1, 2022) (the Sponsor ).
The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee ). The number of shares that constitutes a Basket
for the purpose of creations and redemptions was reduced from 100,000 Shares to 50,000 Shares effective on August 11, 2016. 

The
Trust s Shares at redeemable value increased from 995,151,629 at December 31, 2021 to 1,118,817,327 at December 31, 2022,
the Trust s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares in the Trust increased from 44,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2021 to 48,650,000
Shares outstanding at December 31, 2022. 

The
Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust has no directors, officers or employees. It
does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to improve the losses caused by changes in the price of silver.
The silver held by the Trust will only be delivered to pay the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s
Fee ), distributed to Authorized Participants (defined below) in connection with the redemption of Baskets or sold (1) on
an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its
assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 

The
Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under
such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodities futures contracts, commodity interests or
any other instruments regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ), as administered by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (the CFTC and the National Futures Association NFA ). The Trust is not a commodity
pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not commodity interests, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee
is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. The Trust
has no fixed termination date. 

The
Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.abrdn.com/us/etf through which the registrant s annual reports
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably
practicable after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional
information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 

Trust
Objective 

The
investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical silver bullion, less
the Trust s expenses. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment
similar to an investment in physical silver. An investment in physical silver requires expensive and sometimes complicated
arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense
and complications have resulted in investments in physical silver being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many
investors. 

2 

The
 Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient
 means, with minimal credit risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding silver
 bullion. The Shares offer an investment that: 

Easily
Accessible and Relatively Cost Effective . Investors can access the silver bullion market through a traditional brokerage
account. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation
strategies that use silver bullion by using the Shares instead of using the traditional means of purchasing, trading and
holding silver bullion and for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than those associated with
the purchase, storage and insurance of physical silver. 

Exchange
Traded and Transparent. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca, providing investors with an efficient means to implement various
investment strategies. The Shares are eligible for margin accounts and are backed by the assets of the Trust and the Trust does
not hold or employ any derivative securities. Furthermore, the value of the Trust s holdings are reported on the Trust s
website daily. 

Minimal Credit Risk . The Shares represent an interest in physical silver owned by the Trust (other than an amount
held in unallocated form which is not sufficient to make up a whole bar of which is held temporarily to effect a creation
or redemption of Shares). Physical silver of the Trust in the Custodian s possession is not subject to borrowing arrangements
with third parties. Other than the silver temporarily being held in an unallocated silver account with the Custodian,
the physical silver of the Trust is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. See Risk Factors Silver
held in the Trust s unallocated silver account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated silver account
is not segregated from the Custodian s assets... This contrasts with most other financial products that gain
exposure to silver through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks. 

Investing
in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. See Risk Factors. 

Overview
of the Silver Industry 

This
section provides a brief introduction to the silver industry by looking at some of the key participants, detailing the primary
sources of demand and supply and outlining the role of the official sector (i.e., central banks) in the market. 

In
this annual report, the term ounces refers to troy ounces. 

Market
Participants 

The
participants in the world silver market may be classified in the following sectors: the mining and producer sector, the banking
sector, the official sector, the investment sector, and the manufacturing sector. A brief description of each follows. 

Mining
and Producer Sector 

This
group includes mining companies that specialize in silver and silver production, mining companies that produce silver as a by-product
of other production (such as a copper or gold producer), scrap merchants and recyclers. 

Banking
Sector 

Bullion
banks provide a variety of services to the silver market and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between other
parties. Services provided by the bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing, physical
silver purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers and silver leasing. 

3 

The
Official Sector 

There
are no official statistics published by the International Monetary Fund, Bank of International Settlements, or national banks
on silver holdings by national governments. The main reason for this is that silver is generally not recognized as a reserve asset.
Consequently, there are very limited silver stocks held by governments. According to The Silver Institute World Silver Survey
2022, the identifiable silver bullion inventories are as follows:

The
Investment Sector 

This
sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional and private investors and speculators. These participants
range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges, and retail-level coin collectors. 

The
Manufacturing Sector 

The
fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of silver. Industrial applications comprise
the largest use of silver. The jewelry and silverware sector is the second largest, followed by the photographic industry (although
the latter has been declining over a number of years as a result of the spread of digital photography).

The
following are some of the main characteristics of the silver market illustrated by the table. 

Like
gold, silver has also been used as a currency in the past. However, the main difference between gold and silver is that while
approximately half of gold demand is used for jewelry, approximately half of silver fabrication demand is used for industrial
applications. 

New
mine production accounts for approximately 82 of total silver supply. Recycled silver accounts for around 17 of total supply. 

Industrial
applications and jewelry demand accounted for over 65 of total demand in 2021. Photography has been taking a lower share of overall
silver demand falling from 5 in 2012 to 3 in 2021, while photovoltaic demand has risen in recent years accounting for 11 in 2021. Investment in ETP s rose significantly in 2020 and represented 28 of demand in 2020. 

Historical
chart of the price of Silver 

The
price of silver is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements
in the price of silver in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors,
including announcements from central banks regarding a country s reserve silver holdings, agreements among central banks,
political uncertainties around the world, and economic concerns. The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of
an ounce of silver in dollars from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2022 and is based on information provided by Bloomberg: 

Source: Bloomberg, abrdn.
Chart data from 12/31/2012 to 12/31/2022. Silver Price = SLVRLND Index. 

Starting
in early 2011, when silver prices peaked at 48.44 per ounce, silver prices began a downward trend, albeit with multiple
upwards rallies (that have often lasted several months). The rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar, sluggish industrial growth
and a tame inflation environment (which led some investors to revise their expectations of the effects of monetary expansion) were
some of the drivers behind the fall in silver prices from 2011 to 2019. Silver reversed course in 2020, as prices rose 46.75 ,
closing at 26.49 per ounce. In 2021, silver took a slight step back after its historic performance in 2020, as it returned -13 
(as of December 31, 2021). As the world emerged out of the pandemic, silver took a backseat to riskier asset classes such as equities
which is a reason for its negative performance during the year. 2022 was a volatile year for silver, as the price reached 26.41 per ounce in the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, up more
than 13 from the end of 2021. However, the price of silver fell as low as 17.81 per ounce at the beginning of September, as the risk
of diminishing global economic growth, and aggressive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve caused the U.S. Dollar to strengthen
and silver prices to weaken. The potential of a weakening U.S. Dollar, amidst low silver inventory levels and a reopening Chinese economy,
sparked a Q4 rally that saw the price of silver climb 25.9 over the quarter to close the year at 23.95 per ounce. Despite the volatile
year, in 2022 the price of silver rose 2.8 above its 2021 closing price.

Operation
of the Silver Bullion Market 

The
global trade in silver consists of Over-the-Counter OTC transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other
derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options. 

Global
Over-The-Counter Market 

The
OTC silver market includes spot, forward, and option and other derivative transactions conducted on a principal-to-principal basis.
While this is a global, nearly 24-hour per day market, its main centers are London (the biggest venue) and New York. Market makers,
as well as others in the OTC market, trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks
and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. Market makers include the market making members
of the London Bullion Market Association LBMA ), the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities
conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the London bullion market. The twelve market-making members of the
LBMA are: BNP Paribas SA, Citibank N.A, Credit Suisse AG Zurich, HSBC, Goldman Sachs International, ICBC Standard Bank Plc, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, Merrill Lynch International, Morgan Stanley Co. International Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Toronto-Dominion
Bank and UBS AG. The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery
and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet clients requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure
and no open outcry meeting place. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together
with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these market centers. Centers such as Dubai and
several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business, typically involving jewelry and small bars of silver
(1 kilogram or less) and will hedge their exposure by selling into one of these main OTC centers. Bullion dealers have offices
around the world and most of the world s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA. There
are a further 75 full members, plus a number of associate members around the world. The number of LBMA market-making, clearing
and full members reported in this annual report are as of the date of this annual report. These numbers may change from time to
time as new members are added and existing members drop out. In the OTC market for silver, the standard size of trades between
market makers is 100,000 ounces. Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading
day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads the differential between a dealer s
 buy and sell prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the bullion markets generally occurs at the
time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading
in London, New York, Zurich and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. COMEX ),
a designated contract market within the CME Group. This period lasts for approximately four hours each New York business day morning. 

The
London Silver Bullion Market 

Although
the market for physical silver is distributed globally, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating
market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of
the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the Good Delivery List, which
is a list of LBMA accredited refiners of silver. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading
practices and develops standard documentation. 

The
term loco London silver refers to silver physically held in London that meets the specifications for weight, dimensions,
fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of a LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in The
Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars published by the LBMA. Silver bars meeting these requirements are described
in this report from time to time as Silver Good Delivery Bars. The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose
conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A Silver Good
Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. A Silver Good Delivery Bar must contain
between 750 troy ounces and 1,100 troy ounces of silver with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.0 parts per 1,000. A Silver
Good Delivery Bar must also bear the stamp of one of the refiners who are on the LBMA-approved list. Unless otherwise specified,
the silver spot price always refers to that of a Silver Good Delivery Bar. Business is generally conducted over the phone and
through electronic dealing systems.

On
July 14, 2017, the LBMA announced that ICE Benchmark Administration IBA had been selected to be the third-party
administrator for the LBMA Silver Price . Effective from October 2, 2017, IBA is providing the auction platform and
methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Silver Price benchmark. IBA operates an equilibrium
auction , which is an electronic, tradable and auditable, over-the-counter auction for LBMA-authorized participating silver
bullion banks or market makers and sponsored clients of direct participants silver participants that establishes
a reference silver price for that day s trading, often referred to as the LBMA Silver Price . The LBMA Silver
Price equilibrium auction operated by CME Group Inc. and Refinitiv prior to October 2, 2017 was selected by the LBMA as the silver
valuation replacement for the London silver fix previously determined by the London Silver Market Fixing Ltd. that was discontinued
on August 14, 2014. The LBMA Silver Price has become a widely used benchmark for daily silver prices and is quoted by various
financial information sources as the London silver fix was previously. 

The
LBMA Silver Price is the result of an equilibrium auction because it establishes a price for a troy ounce of Silver
Good Delivery Bars that clears the maximum amount of bids and offers for silver entered by order-submitting silver participants
each day. IBA uses ICE s front-end system, WebICE, as the technology platform that allows direct participants, as well as
sponsored clients of direct participants, to manage their orders in the auction in real time via their own desktops. As the IBA
electronic silver auction market develops, IBA expects to admit additional silver participants to the order submission process.
The benchmark is published when the auction finishes, typically a few minutes after 12:00 noon (London time). 

At
the opening of each auction, IBA in the role of auction chairman Chairman announces an opening price (in U.S.
Dollars), that takes into account current market conditions and begins auction rounds, with an expected duration of at least 30
seconds each. During each auction round, participants may enter the volume they wish to buy or sell at that price, and such orders
will be part of the price formation. Aggregate bid and offer volume is shown live on WebICE. At the end of each auction round,
the total net volume is calculated. If this imbalance is larger than the imbalance tolerance (normally 500,000 oz.)
then the Chairman sets a new price (based on the current market conditions, and the direction and magnitude of the imbalance in
the round) and begins a new auction round. If the imbalance is less than the tolerance, then the auction is complete with all
volume tradeable at that price. The price is then set in U.S. Dollars and also converted into other currencies, including Australian
Dollars, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Onshore and Offshore Yuan, Indian Rupees, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Russian
Rubles, Singapore Dollars, South African Rand, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars, Thai Baht and Turkish Lira. The auction is run
at 12:00 noon (London time). 

During
the auction, the price at the start of each round, and the volumes at the end of each round are available through major market
data vendors. As soon as the auction finishes, the final prices and volumes are available through major market data vendors. IBA
also publishes transparency reports, detailing the prices, volumes and times for each round of the auction. These transparency
reports are available through major market data vendors and IBA when the auction finishes. The process can also be observed real-time
through a WebICE screen. The auction mechanism provides a complete audit trail. 

There
are currently thirteen direct participants who have been accredited to contribute to the LBMA Silver Price: Citibank N.A. London
Branch, Coins N Things Inc., DRW Investments, LLC, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA NA, Jane Street Global Trading
LLC, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A London Branch, Koch Supply and Trading LP, Marex, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered Bank, StoneX
Financial Ltd. and The Toronto Dominion Bank. 

Since
April 1, 2015, the LBMA Silver Price has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA in the United Kingdom UK ). IBA is authorized as a regulated benchmark administrator by the FCA. Under the UK benchmark regulation,
the governance structure for a regulated benchmark must include an Oversight Committee, made up of market participants, industry
bodies, direct participant representatives, infrastructure providers and the administrator (i.e., IBA). Through the Oversight
Committee the LBMA continues to have significant involvement in the oversight of the auction process, including, among other matters,
changes to the methodology and accreditation of direct participants. The price discovery process for the LBMA Silver Price is
subject to surveillance by IBA. IBA has been formally assessed against the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the IOSCO
Principles ). In order to meet the IOSCO Principles, the price discovery used for the LBMA Silver Price benchmark is auditable
and transparent. 

6 

The
LBMA Silver Price is viewed as a full and fair representation of all market interest at the conclusion of the auction. IBA s
auction process is similar to CME Group s auction process, which in turn was similar to the non-electronic process previously
used to establish the London silver fix where the London silver fix process adjusted the silver price up or down until all the
buy and sell orders are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LBMA Silver Price has several advantages
over the previous London silver fix. IBA s auction process is fully transparent in real-time to direct participants and
sponsored clients and, at the close of each auction, to the general public. IBA s auction process is also fully auditable
since an audit trail exists for every change made in the process. Moreover, the audit trail and active surveillance of the auction
process by IBA, as well as the FCA s oversight of IBA, deters manipulative and abusive conduct in establishing each day s
LBMA Silver Price. 

Since
August 15, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London silver fix, which ceased to be published as of that date, would be an
inappropriate basis for valuing silver bullion received upon purchase of the Trust s Shares, delivered upon redemption of
the Trust s Shares and otherwise held by the Trust on a daily basis, and that the LBMA Silver Price is an appropriate alternative
for determining the value of the Trust s silver each trading day. The Sponsor also determined that the LBMA Silver Price
fairly represents the commercial value of silver bullion held by the Trust and that the Benchmark Price (as defined
in the Trust Agreement) as of any day is the LBMA Silver Price for such day. 

Futures
Exchanges 

The
most significant silver futures exchanges are the COMEX, a designated contract market within the CME Group, and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange TOCOM ). Futures exchanges
seek to provide a neutral, regulated marketplace for the trading of derivatives contracts for commodities. Futures contracts are
defined by the exchange for each commodity. For each commodity traded, this contract specifies the precise quality and quantity
standards. The contract s terms and conditions also define the location and timing of physical delivery. 

An
exchange does not buy or sell those contracts, but seeks to offer a transparent forum where members, on their own behalf or on
the behalf of customers, can trade the contracts in a safe, efficient and orderly manner. During regular trading hours at the
COMEX, the commodity contracts are traded on CME Globex system, an electronic auction in which all bids, offers and trades
must be publicly announced to all members and, upon execution, centrally cleared. Electronic trading is offered by the exchange
almost 24 hours a day (except for a short break in the evening), six days a week. 

In
addition to the public nature of the pricing, futures exchanges in the United States are regulated at two levels: internal and
external governmental supervision. The internal is performed through self-regulation and consists of regular monitoring of the
following: the central algorithmic matching process to ensure that it is conducted in conformance with all exchange rules; the
orderly trading and settlement of futures and options; the financial condition of all exchange member firms to ensure that they
continuously meet financial commitments; and the volume positions of commercial and non-commercial customers to ensure that physical
delivery and other commercial commitments can be met, and that pricing is not being improperly affected by the size of any particular
customer positions. External governmental oversight is performed by the CFTC, which reviews all the rules and regulations of United
States futures exchanges and clearing houses and monitors their enforcement. 

Market
Regulation 

The
global silver markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain
trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. In the UK, responsibility for
the regulation of the financial market participants, including the major participating members of the LBMA falls under the
authority of the FCA as provided by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 FSM Act ). Under this act,
all UK-based banks, together with other investment firms, are subject to a range of requirements, including fitness and properness,
capital adequacy, liquidity, and systems and controls. 

7 

The
FCA is responsible for regulating investment products, including derivatives, and those who deal in investment products. Regulation
of spot, commercial forwards, and deposits of silver not covered by the FSM Act is provided for by The London Code of Conduct
for Non-Investment Products, which was established by market participants in conjunction with the Bank of England. 

The
TOCOM has authority to perform financial and operational surveillance on its members trading activities, scrutinize positions
held by members and large-scale customers, and monitor the price movements of futures markets by comparing them with cash and
other derivative markets prices. To act as a Futures Commission Merchant Broker on the TOCOM, a broker must obtain a license
from Japan s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry METI ), the regulatory authority that oversees the operations
of the TOCOM. 

The
US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC regulates trading in commodity contracts, such as futures, options
and swaps. In addition, under the Commodity Exchange Act CEA ), the CFTC has jurisdiction to prosecute manipulation
and fraud in any commodity (including precious metals) traded in interstate commerce as spot as well as deliverable forwards.
The CFTC is the exclusive regulator of U.S. commodity exchanges and clearing houses. 

Secondary
Market Trading 

While
the Trust s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of silver bullion, less the expenses
of the Trust, the Shares may trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca at prices that are lower or higher relative to their
net asset value (the value of the Trust s assets less its liabilities NAV )) per Share. The amount of the
discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between
the NYSE Arca, COMEX and the London silver markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 PM New York time, liquidity
in the global silver market is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during this time,
trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen. 

Valuation
of Silver and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On
each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time,
on such day Evaluation Time ), the Trustee evaluates the silver held by the Trust and determines both the adjusted
net asset value ANAV and the NAV of the Trust. 

At
the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust s silver on the basis of that day s LBMA Silver Price 
(the daily price of an ounce of silver determined by an electronic, over-the-counter auction that starts at 12:00 noon London,
England time in which LBMA-accredited bullion banks or market makers participate), or, if no LBMA Silver Price is made
on such day, the next most recent LBMA Silver Price determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor
determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the LBMA Silver
Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust s
silver is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s silver, it shall identify an alternative basis for such
evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination
that the LBMA Silver Price or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust s
silver or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good
faith. See Operation of the Silver Bullion Market The London Silver Bullion Market for a description
of the LBMA Silver Price. 

Once
the value of the silver has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than
the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place which are computed by reference to the value of the Trust
or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the silver and any other assets
of the Trust. The resulting figure is the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor s Fee. 

8 

All
fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place which are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or
its assets are calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The Trustee subtracts from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees
so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share
by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes
the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

Any
estimate of the accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities of the Trust for purposes of computing the NAV of the Trust
and ANAV made by the Trustee in good faith shall be conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction
in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those
actually paid. 

The
Sponsor and the Shareholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Trustee, and the Sponsor has no responsibility for the
evaluation s accuracy. The determinations the Trustee makes will be made in good faith upon the basis of, and the Trustee
will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Trustee will not be liable to the
Sponsor, DTC, Authorized Participants, the Shareholders or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding liability
exclusion will not protect the Trustee against any liability resulting from bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of
its duties. 

Trust
Expenses 

The
Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor s Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor
has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee
and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements,
Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses. 

The
Sponsor s Fee accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.45 of the ANAV of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears.
The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s Fee at its discretion for a stated
period of time. Currently, this is being done on an annual basis. The Sponsor has decided to waive a portion of the Sponsor s
Fee to reduce the Sponsor s Fee to 0.30 . This fee waiver has been in existence since the Trust was formed. Presently, the
Sponsor is continuing to waive a portion of its fee and reduce the Sponsor s fee to 0.30 . In the future, the Sponsor may
continue its fee waiver, waive a larger or smaller portion of its fee or not renew its fee waiver. If, at any point in the future,
the Sponsor does not continue its partial fee waiver, the full Sponsor s Fee will accrue and be paid to the Sponsor for
subsequent periods. The Sponsor is under no obligation to continue to waive all or part of the Sponsor s Fee on an ongoing
basis. 

The
Sponsor s Fee is paid by delivery of silver to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated
basis, monthly on the first business day of the month in respect of fees payable for the prior month. The delivery is of that
number of ounces of silver which equals the daily accrual of the Sponsor s Fee for such prior month calculated at the LBMA
Silver Price. 

The
Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell silver in such
quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee
is authorized to sell silver at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it
being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than silver. Accordingly, the amount of silver
to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and the market price of silver. The
Custodian has agreed to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, silver needed to cover Trust expenses not assumed
by the Sponsor at a price at least equal to the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the silver held by the Trust
on the date of the sale. 

The
Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3,061,148 (December 31, 2021: 2,968,351; December
31, 2020: 1,787,310). 

9 

Cash
held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust s expenses will not bear any interest. Each delivery or sale of silver by
the Trust to pay the Sponsor s Fee or other Trust expenses will be a taxable event to Shareholders. 

Creation
and Redemption of Shares 

The
Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets of 50,000 Shares. The creation and redemption
of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of silver
represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares
included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized
Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered
broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, which are not required
to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions, and (2) participants in DTC. To become an Authorized Participant,
a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Authorized Participant Agreement
provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the silver and any cash required
for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended
by the Trustee and the Sponsor, without the consent of any Shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants pay
a transaction fee of 500 to the Trustee for each order they place to create or redeem one or more Baskets. Authorized Participants
who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement
of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust for serving as an Authorized Participant, and no such person has any obligation
or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. 

Authorized
Participants are cautioned that some of their activities will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a
manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of
the Securities Act. 

Prior
to initiating any creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have entered into an agreement with the Custodian
or a silver clearing bank to establish an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account in London or Zurich Authorized
Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement ). Silver held in Authorized Participant Unallocated Accounts is
typically not segregated from the Custodian s or other silver clearing bank s assets, as a consequence of which
an Authorized Participant will have no proprietary interest in any specific bars of silver held by the Custodian or the
clearing bank. Credits to its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account are therefore at risk of the Custodian s or other silver
clearing bank s insolvency. No fees will be charged by the Custodian for the use of the Authorized Participant Unallocated
Account as long as the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is used solely for silver transfers to and from the Trust
Unallocated Account and the Custodian (or one of its affiliates) receives compensation for maintaining the Trust Allocated Account.
Authorized Participants should be aware that the Custodian s liability threshold under the Authorized Participant Unallocated
Bullion Account Agreement is generally gross negligence, not negligence, which is the Custodian s liability threshold under
the Trust s Custody Agreements. 

As
the terms of the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement differ in certain respects from the terms of the
Trust s Unallocated Account Agreement, potential Authorized Participants should review the terms of the Authorized Participant
Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement carefully. A copy of the Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained by potential Authorized
Participants from the Trustee. 

Certain
Authorized Participants are expected to have the facility to participate directly in the physical silver market and the silver
futures markets. In some cases, an Authorized Participant may from time to time acquire silver from or sell silver to
its affiliated silver trading desk, which may profit in these instances. Each Authorized Participant must be registered as
a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act and regulated by FINRA or be exempt from
being or otherwise not be required to be so regulated or registered, and must be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in
the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants are regulated
under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal
controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime. 

10 

Authorized
Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants
that wish to create or redeem Baskets. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of
multiple clients. As of the date of this report, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley
 Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas, LLC have each signed an Authorized
Participant Agreement with the Trust and, upon the effectiveness of such agreement, may create and redeem Baskets as described
above. Persons interested in purchasing Baskets should contact the Sponsor or the Trustee to obtain the contact information for
the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants are only able to redeem their Shares through an
Authorized Participant. 

All silver will
be delivered to the Trust and distributed by the Trust in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized
Participant Unallocated Accounts and the Trust Unallocated Account. Silver transferred from an Authorized Participant Unallocated
Account to the Trust in unallocated form will first be credited to the Trust Unallocated Account. Thereafter, the Custodian will
allocate, or cause the allocation by the Zurich Sub-Custodian of, specific bars of silver representing the amount of silver
credited to the Trust Unallocated Account (to the extent such amount is representable by whole silver bars) to the Trust
Allocated Account. The movement of silver is reversed for the distribution of silver to an Authorized Participant in connection
with the redemption of Baskets. 

All
physical silver represented by a credit to any Authorized Participant Unallocated Account and to the Trust Unallocated Account
and all physical silver held in the Trust Allocated Account with the Custodian must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity)
of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5 and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations practices and customs of the LBMA, including the
specifications for a Silver Good Delivery Bar. 

Under
the Authorized Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

The
following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer
to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail. 

Creation
Procedures 

On
any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to create one or more Baskets. Creation and redemption
orders are accepted on business days the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Settlements of such orders requiring
receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of silver in the UK, Zurich or another jurisdiction will occur on
 business days when (1) banks in the UK or another jurisdiction and (2) the London silver markets are regularly open
for business. If such banks or the London silver markets are not open for regular business for a full day, such a day will only
be a business day for settlement purposes if the settlement procedures can be completed by the end of such day.
Settlement of orders requiring receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of Shares will occur, after confirmation
of the applicable silver delivery, on business days when the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. In the event
of a level 3 market-wide circuit breaker resulting in a trading halt for the remainder of the trading day, the time of the market-wide
trading halt is considered the close of regular trading and no creation orders for the current trade date will be accepted after
that time (the cutoff ). Orders placed after the cutoff will be deemed to be rejected and will not be processed.
Orders should be placed in proper form on the following business day. Purchase orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m.
on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. 

11 

By
placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit silver with the Trust. Prior to the delivery of Baskets
for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for
the purchase order. 

Determination
of required deposits 

The
amount of silver in the required deposit is determined by dividing the number of ounces of silver held by the Trust by the number
of Baskets outstanding, as adjusted for the amount of silver constituting estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the
Trust. Fractions of a fine ounce of silver smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce which are included in the silver deposit amount
are disregarded in the foregoing calculation. All questions as to the composition of a Creation Basket Deposit will be finally
determined by the Trustee. The Trustee s determination of the Creation Basket Deposit shall be final and binding on all
persons interested in the Trust. 

Delivery
of required deposits 

An
Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account
with the required silver deposit amount by the second business day in London following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of
the silver deposit amount, the Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee,
will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the silver deposit amount from the Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and the Trustee will direct DTC to credit the number of Baskets ordered to
the Authorized Participant s DTC account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of silver until such
silver has been received by the Trust shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. The Trustee may accept delivery of
silver by such other means as the Sponsor, from time to time, may determine with the Trustee to be acceptable for the Trust, provided
that the same is disclosed in a prospectus relating to the Trust filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities
Act. If silver is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to establish such procedures and to
appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts in addition to those described in this report, as the Sponsor determines
to be desirable. 

Acting
on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the silver deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated
Account to the Trust Allocated Account by transferring silver bars from its inventory to the Trust Allocated Account. The Custodian
uses commercially reasonable efforts to complete the transfer of silver to the Trust Allocated Account prior to the time by which
the Trustee is to credit the Basket to the Authorized Participant s DTC account; if, however, such transfers have not been
completed by such time, the number of Baskets ordered will be delivered against receipt of the silver deposit amount in the Trust
Unallocated Account, and all Shareholders will be exposed to the risks of unallocated silver to the extent of that silver deposit
amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process or a Zurich Sub-Custodian completes the allocation process for the
Custodian. See Risk Factors silver held in the Trust s unallocated silver account and any Authorized Participant s
unallocated silver account will not be segregated from the Custodian s assets.... 

Because
silver is allocated only in multiples of whole bars, the amount of silver allocated from the Trust Unallocated Account to the
Trust Allocated Account may be less than the total fine ounces of silver credited to the Trust Unallocated Account. Any balance
will be held in the Trust Unallocated Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of silver
held in the Trust Unallocated Account; no more than 430 troy ounces of silver (maximum weight to make one Silver Good Delivery
Bar) is expected to be held in the Trust Unallocated Account at the close of each business day. 

Rejection
of purchase orders 

The
Trustee may reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if such order or Creation Basket Deposit is not presented in
proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of counsel,
might be unlawful. None of the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or
Creation Basket Deposit. 

12 

Redemption
Procedures 

The
procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets will mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets.
On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders
must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. In the event of a level
3 market-wide circuit breaker resulting in a trading halt for the remainder of the trading day, the time of the market-wide trading
halt is considered the close of regular trading and no redemption orders for the current trade date will be accepted after that
time (the cutoff ). Orders placed after the cutoff will be deemed to be rejected and will not be processed. Orders
should be placed in proper form on the following business day. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received
in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets and do not entitle
an individual Shareholder to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Basket, or to redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized
Participant. 

By
placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book entry
system to the Trust not later than the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the
delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee
the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 

Determination
of redemption distribution 

The
redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account representing the amount of the silver held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed. Fractions
of a fine ounce of silver included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption
distributions will be subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. 

Delivery
of redemption distribution 

The
redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on or before the fifth business day
following a loco London redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day after the loco London
redemption order date, the Trustee s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. If a loco swap or physical
transfer is necessary to effect a loco London redemption, the redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to
the Authorized Participant on or before the fifth business day following such a loco London redemption order date if, by 10:00
a.m. New York time on the second business day after the loco London redemption order date, the Trustee s DTC account has
been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. In the event that, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day following
the order date of a redemption order, the Trustee s DTC account has not been credited with the total number of Shares corresponding
to the total number of Baskets to be redeemed pursuant to such redemption order, the Trustee shall send to the Authorized Participant
and the Custodian via fax or electronic mail message notice of such fact and the Authorized Participant shall have two business
days following receipt of such notice to correct such failure. If such failure is not cured within such two business day period,
the Trustee (in consultation with the Sponsor) will cancel such redemption order and will send via fax or electronic mail message
notice of such cancellation to the Authorized Participant and the Custodian, and the Authorized Participant will be solely responsible
for all costs incurred by the Trust, the Trustee or the Custodian related to the cancelled order. The Trustee is also authorized
to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Trustee s
DTC account by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant
has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book entry system on such terms as the Sponsor and
the Trustee may from time to time agree upon. 

13 

The
Custodian transfers the redemption silver amount from the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and, thereafter,
to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account. The Authorized Participant and the
Trust are each at risk in respect of silver credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodian s
insolvency. See Risk Factors Silver held in the Trust s unallocated silver account and any Authorized Participant s
unallocated silver account is not segregated from the Custodian s assets.... 

As
with the allocation of silver to the Trust Allocated Account which occurs upon a purchase order, if in transferring silver from
the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account in connection with a redemption order there is an excess amount of
silver transferred to the Trust Unallocated Account, the excess over the silver redemption amount will be held in the Trust Unallocated
Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of silver held in the Trust Unallocated Account;
no more than 1,100 ounces of silver (maximum weight to make one Silver Good Delivery Bar) is expected to be held in the Trust
Unallocated Account at the close of each business day. 

Suspension
or rejection of redemption orders 

The
Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption
settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or
trading on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted or (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which
delivery, disposal or evaluation of silver is not reasonably practicable. None of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Custodian are
liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 

The
Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement
or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. 

Creation
and Redemption Transaction Fe e 

To
compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required
to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of 500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets.
The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. From time to
time, the Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, may waive all or a portion of the applicable transfer fee. The Trustee
shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption
of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice. 

The
Sponsor 

The
Trust s Sponsor is abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC (known as Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC prior to March 1, 2022
and ETF Securities USA LLC prior to October 1, 2018), a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 17, 2009. 

The
Sponsor s office is located at c/o abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC, 1900 Market Street, Suite 200, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Prior
to April 27, 2018, the Sponsor was wholly-owned by ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. Effective
April 27, 2018, ETF Securities Limited sold its membership interest in the Sponsor to abrdn Inc. (known as Aberdeen Standard Investments
Inc. prior to January 1, 2022), a Delaware corporation. As a result of the sale, abrdn Inc. became the sole member of the Sponsor.
abrdn Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of abrdn plc, which together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, is collectively
referred to as abrdn. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor,
the sole member of the Sponsor, abrdn Inc., is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely
by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor. 

14 

The
Sponsor s Role 

The
Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust, and is responsible for the ongoing registration of the Shares for their public
offering in the United States and the listing of the Shares on the NYSE Arca. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative
and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s
fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration
fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of
the Trust s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 

The
Sponsor does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or the Custodian. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint
a successor Trustee (i) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital,
surplus and undivided profits of at least 150 million), (ii) if, having received written notice of a material breach of its obligations
under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (iii) if the Trustee refuses to consent to
the implementation of an amendment to the Trust s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Sponsor also has
the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is
not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third
anniversary thereafter. The Sponsor also has the right to approve any new or additional custodian that the Trustee may wish to
appoint. 

The
Sponsor or one of its affiliates or agents (1) develops a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis, (2) prepares marketing
materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trust s website and (3) executes the marketing plan for the
Trust. 

The
Trustee 

The
Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers BNYM ),
serves as the Trustee. BNYM has a trust office at 240 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10286. BNYM is subject to supervision by
the New York State Financial Services Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Information regarding
creation and redemption Basket composition, NAV of the Trust, transaction fees and the names of the parties that have each executed
an Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained from BNYM. A copy of the Trust Agreement is available for inspection at BNYM s
trust office identified above. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is required to have capital, surplus and undivided profits
of at least 150 million. 

The
Trustee s Role 

The
Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust s operational
records. The Trustee s principal responsibilities include (1) transferring the Trust s silver as needed to pay the
Sponsor s Fee in silver (silver transfers are expected to occur approximately monthly in the ordinary course), (2)
valuing the Trust s silver and calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share, (3) receiving and processing orders
from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian and
DTC, (4) selling the Trust s silver as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor,
(5) when appropriate, making distributions of cash or other property to Shareholders, and (6) receiving and reviewing reports
from or on the Custodian s custody of and transactions in the Trust s silver. The Trustee shall, with respect to directing
the Custodian, act in accordance with the instructions of the Sponsor. If the Custodian resigns, the Trustee shall appoint an
additional or replacement Custodian selected by the Sponsor. 

The
Trustee intends to regularly communicate with the Sponsor to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Trustee does not
monitor the performance of the Custodian, or any other sub-custodian other than to review the reports provided by the Custodian
pursuant to the Custody Agreements. The Trustee, along with the Sponsor, will liaise with the Trust s legal, accounting
and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee will assist and support the Sponsor with the preparation of all
periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust. 

The
Trustee s monthly fees and out-of-pocket expenses are paid by the Sponsor. 

15 

Affiliates
of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell silver or Shares for their own
account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Affiliates of the Trustee
are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants. 

The
Custodian 

JPMorgan
Chase Bank N.A. JPMorgan serves as the Custodian of the Trust s silver. JPMorgan is a national banking association
organized under the laws of the United States of America. JPMorgan is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. JPMorgan s London office is regulated by the FCA and is located at 25
Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Co. While the United
Kingdom operations of the Custodian are regulated by the FCA, the custodial services provided by the Custodian and any sub-custodian
under the Custody Agreements, are presently not a regulated activity subject to the supervision and rules of the FCA. 

The
Custodian s Role 

The
Custodian is responsible for safekeeping of the Trust s silver deposited with it by Authorized Participants in connection
with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian is also responsible for selecting sub-custodians, if any. The Custodian facilitates
the transfer of silver in and out of the Trust through the unallocated silver accounts it will maintain for each Authorized Participant
and the unallocated and allocated silver accounts it will maintain for the Trust. The Custodian holds the Trust s allocated
silver at a sub-custodian. The Custodian is responsible for allocating specific bars of silver bullion to the Trust Allocated
Account. The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the silver transfers in and out of the Trust s
unallocated and allocated silver accounts and identifying the silver bars held in the Trust s allocated silver account. 

The
Custodian s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor. 

The
Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell silver or Shares for their
own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Custodian and its
affiliates are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants. 

Inspection
of Silver 

Under
the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit
the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s silver and certain related records maintained
by the Custodian. In addition, under the Custody Agreements, the Custodian shall procure that any sub-custodian that it appoints
allows access to its premises during normal business hours to examine the Trust s silver held there and such records as
the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may reasonably require to perform their respective duties
to Shareholders. 

The
Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian in order to examine the silver and the records maintained by them.
Inspections were conducted by Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd, a leading commodity inspection and testing company retained by
the Sponsor, as of June 30,2022 and December 31, 2022. 

There
can be no guarantee that the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors will be able to perform physical inspections
of the Trust s silver as planned. Local policies, regulations, or ordinances, as well as polices or restrictions adopted
by the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian, may temporarily prevent, or otherwise impair the ability
of, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors, from performing a physical inspection of the Trust s silver
on a desired date. In those situations, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may seek to verify the silver held
by the Trust by alternate means, including through virtual inspections of the Trust s silver and/or a review of pertinent
records. 

16 

Description
of the Shares 

General 

The
Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Trustee creates Shares
only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares) and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The Shares represent
units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance
of Shares above the amount registered on the Trust s then-current and effective registration statement with the SEC will
require the registration of such additional Shares. 

Description
of Limited Rights 

The
Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to shares of a corporation operating
a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated
with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative 
actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable
and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. The Shares
do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights
to distributions. 

Distributions 

If
the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction
of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges
and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee
for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 

Voting
and Approvals 

Under
the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The Trustee may terminate the Trust
upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 75 of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust
Agreement require advance notice to the Shareholders before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no Shareholder vote or approval
is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement. 

Redemption
of the Shares 

The
Shares may only be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant and only in Baskets. 

Book-Entry
Form 

Individual
certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates is deposited by the Trustee with DTC
and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding
at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies (DTC Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC
Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the
Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC.
Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their
Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares.
Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 

17 

Custody
of the Trust s Silver 

Custody
of the silver bullion deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by sub-custodians selected by the Custodian. The Custodian
is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA. 

The
Custodian is the custodian of the silver bullion credited to Trust Allocated Account in accordance with the Custody Agreements.
The Custodian segregates the silver bullion credited to the Trust Allocated Account from any other precious metal it holds or
holds for others by entering appropriate entries in its books and records. Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor
and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may inspect the vaults of the Custodian. See Inspection of Silver . 

The
Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of silver
in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions specified in the Custody Agreements, the Custodian allocates silver deposited
in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting bars of silver bullion for deposit to the Trust Allocated Account. All silver
bullion allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, and the Custodian must
replace any non-conforming silver bullion with conforming silver bullion as soon as practical upon a determination by the Custodian
any silver bullion is non-conforming. 

The
process of withdrawing silver from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket follows the same general procedure as for depositing silver
with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. Each transfer of silver between the Trust Allocated Account and
the Trust Unallocated Account connected with a creation or redemption of a Basket may result in a small amount of silver
being held in the Trust Unallocated Account after the completion of the transfer. In making deposits and withdrawals between the
Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the amount of silver held in the Trust Unallocated Account as of the close of each business day. See Creation and
Redemption of Shares. 

United
States Federal Income Tax Consequences 

The
following discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences generally applies to the purchase, ownership and disposition
of Shares by a US Shareholder (as defined below) and certain US federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in
Shares by a Non-US Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as
amended (the Code ). The discussion below is based on the Code, United States Treasury Regulations Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the
date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of
Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders,
banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, Shareholders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not
discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as capital assets 
within the meaning of Code section 1221 and not as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale
transaction. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law or any transfer tax
on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal, state, local
and foreign tax law or any transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares. 

For
purposes of this discussion, a US Shareholder is a Shareholder that is: 

An
individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the United States; 

A
corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 

An
estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 

18 

A
trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one
or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

A
Shareholder that is not a US Shareholder as defined above (other than a partnership, or an entity treated as a partnership for
US federal tax purposes) generally is considered a Non-US Shareholder for purposes of this discussion. For US federal
income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a
partnership for US federal income tax purposes, generally depends upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the
partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the US federal income tax consequences
of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares. 

Taxation
of the Trust 

The
Trust is classified as a grantor trust for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not
subject to US federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses flow through to the Shareholders,
and the Trustee reports the Trust s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service IRS on that basis. 

Taxation
of US Shareholders 

Shareholders
generally are treated, for US federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets
held by the Trust. Shareholders are also treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata share of the Trust s
income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata share of the Trust s expenses. In the case of
a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the Trust at the
time it acquires its Shares is equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares
as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of silver to the Trust in exchange for the Shares is not a taxable event
to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder s tax basis and holding period for the Shares are the same as its tax basis and
holding period for the silver delivered in exchange therefore (except to the extent of any cash contributed for such Shares).
For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the
same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares,
should consult their tax advisors. 

When
the Trust sells or transfers silver, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount
equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale or
transfer and (2) the Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the silver that was sold or transferred. Such gain
or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder has a holding period
in its Shares of longer than one year. A Shareholder s tax basis for its share of any silver sold by the Trust generally
will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder s total basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction
the numerator of which is the amount of silver sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the silver held by the
Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the silver
remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis
allocable to its share of the silver that was sold. 

Upon
a Shareholder s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold a pro rata share of the silver
held in the Trust at the time of the sale. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize a gain or loss on the sale
in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the Shareholder s
tax basis for the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 

A
redemption of some or all of a Shareholder s Shares in exchange for the underlying silver represented by the Shares
redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder s tax basis for the silver received
in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder s tax basis for the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder s
holding period with respect to the silver received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares
redeemed. A subsequent sale of the silver received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 

19 

An
Authorized Participant and other investors may be able to re-invest, on a tax-deferred basis, in-kind redemption proceeds received
from exchange-traded products that are substantially similar to the Trust in the Trust s Shares. Authorized Participants
and other investors should consult their tax advisors as to whether and under what circumstances the reinvestment in the Shares
of proceeds from substantially similar exchange-traded products can be accomplished on a tax-deferred basis. 

Under
current law, gains recognized by individuals, estates or trusts from the sale of collectibles, including physical
silver, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal income tax rate of 28 , rather than the 20 rate applicable
to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gains recognized by an individual upon the sale of Shares held for
more than one year, or attributable to the Trust s sale of any physical silver which the Shareholder is treated (through
its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28 . The tax rates
for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual US Shareholder for one year or less or by a corporate
taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 

In
addition, high-income individuals and certain trusts and estates are subject to a 3.8 Medicare contribution tax that is imposed
on net investment income and gain. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this tax. 

Brokerage
Fees and Trust Expenses 

Any
brokerage or other transaction fees incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares is treated as part of the Shareholder s
tax basis in the Shares. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares reduces the amount realized
by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. 

Shareholders
will be required to recognize a gain or loss upon a sale of silver by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or
all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata
share of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are
individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust, to the extent that
such expenses may be deducted, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Miscellaneous itemized deductions, including expenses for
the production of income, will not be deductible for either regular federal income tax or alternative minimum tax purposes for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026 and thereafter generally are (i) deductible only
to the extent that the aggregate of a Shareholder s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2 of such Shareholder s
adjusted gross income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) not deductible for the purposes of the alternative minimum tax and
(iii) are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under the Code. 

Investment
by Regulated Investment Companies 

Mutual
funds and other investment vehicles which are regulated investment companies within the meaning of Code section
851 should consult with their tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a security 
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying silver for purposes
of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation
of their qualification under Code section 851. In administrative guidance, the IRS stated that it will no longer issue rulings
under Code section 851(b) relating to the determination of whether or not an instrument or position is a security ,
but, instead, intends to defer to guidance from the SEC for such determination. 

20 

United
States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax for US and Non-US Shareholders 

The
Trustee or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provides certain tax-related information
to Shareholders, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding
its allocable portion of the Trust s annual income (if any) and expenses. 

A
US Shareholder may be subject to US backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification
number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-US Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures
to establish that they are not a US person in order to avoid the backup withholding tax. 

The
amount of any backup withholding tax will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder s US federal income tax liability
and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 

Income
Taxation of Non-US Shareholders 

The
Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gains (if any) upon the sale of silver. A Non-US Shareholder generally
is not subject to US federal income tax with respect to gains recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon
the sale of silver by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-US Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for
183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States
sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-US Shareholder of a trade or business in the United
States. 

Taxation
in Jurisdictions other than the United States 

Prospective
purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their
own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United
States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular,
as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale,
redemption or other dealing. 

ERISA
and Related Considerations 

The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements
on certain employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities,
Keogh plans, and certain commingled investment vehicles or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans
or arrangements are invested (collectively, Plans ), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment
of plan assets of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under other
federal law, or under state or local law Other Law ). 

In
contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should
carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan and the Risk Factors discussed above
and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA or Other Law, including, but not limited
to: (1) whether the investment is permitted under the Plan s governing documents, (2) whether the fiduciary has the authority
to make the investment, (3) whether the investment is consistent with the Plan s funding objectives, (4) the tax effects
of the investment on the Plan, and (5) whether the investment is prudent considering the factors discussed in this report. In
addition, ERISA and Code section 4975 prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons who are parties
in interest under ERISA or disqualified persons under section 4975 of the Code. A violation of these rules
may result in the imposition of significant excise taxes and other liabilities. Plans subject to Other Law may be subject to similar
restrictions. 

21 

It
is anticipated that the Shares will constitute publicly offered securities as defined in the Department of Labor
 Plan Asset Regulations, 2510.3-101 (b)(2) as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA. Accordingly, pursuant to
the Plan Asset Regulations, only Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying assets held in the Trust, should
be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to Other Law should consult legal counsel to determine
whether there would be a similar result under the Other Law. 

Investment
by Certain Retirement Plans 

Code
section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a collectible by an individual retirement account IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section 401(a) Tax Qualified
Account is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom
the Tax Qualified Account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The term
 collectible is defined to include, with certain exceptions, any metal or gem . The IRS has issued several
private letter rulings to the effect that a purchase by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code section 401(a)
plan, of publicly-traded shares in a trust holding silver will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA
owner or Tax Qualified Account participant under Code section 408(m). However the private letter rulings provide that, if any
of the Shares so purchased are distributed from the IRA or Tax Qualified Account to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant,
or if any silver is received by such IRA or Tax Qualified Account upon the redemption of any of the Shares purchased by it,
the Shares or silver so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year of distribution, to the extent provided
under the applicable provisions of Code sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. Accordingly, potential IRA or Tax Qualified Account investors
are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the treatment of an investment in Shares under Code section
408(m). 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Shareholders
should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. Shareholders should also refer to the
other information included in the prospectus and this report, including the Trust s financial statements and the related
notes. 

RISKS
RELATED TO SILVER 

The
price of silver may be affected by the sale of ETVs tracking the silver markets. 

To
the extent existing exchange traded vehicles ETVs tracking the silver markets represent a significant proportion
of demand for physical silver bullion, large redemptions of the securities of these ETVs could negatively affect physical silver
bullion prices and the price and NAV of the Shares. 

Crises
may motivate large-scale sales of silver which could decrease the price of silver and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The
possibility of large-scale distress sales of silver in times of crisis may have a short-term negative impact on the price of silver
and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. For example, the 2008 financial credit crisis resulted in significantly depressed
prices of silver largely due to a slowdown in demand in silver for industrial use and forced sales and deleveraging from institutional
investors. Crises in the future may impair silver s price performance which would, in turn, adversely affect an investment
in the Shares. 

Several
factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of silver and a corresponding decline in the price of Shares. Among
them: 

A
 significant increase in silver hedging activity by silver producers. Should there be
 an increase in the level of hedge activity of silver producing companies, it could cause
 a decline in world silver prices, adversely affecting the price of the Shares. 

22 

A
 significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards silver. Should
 the speculative community take a negative view towards silver, it could cause a decline
 in world silver prices, negatively impacting the price of the Shares. 

A
 widening of interest rate differentials between the cost of money and the cost of silver
 could negatively affect the price of silver which, in turn, could negatively affect the
 price of the Shares. 

A
 combination of rising money interest rates and a continuation of the current low cost
 of borrowing silver could improve the economics of selling silver forward. This could
 result in an increase in hedging by silver mining companies and short selling by speculative
 interests, which would negatively affect the price of silver. Under such circumstances,
 the price of the Shares would be similarly affected. 

Conversely,
several factors may trigger a temporary increase in the price of silver prior to your investment in the Shares. For example, sudden
increased investor interest in silver may cause an increase in world silver prices, increasing the price of the Shares. If that
is the case, you will be buying Shares at prices affected by the temporarily high prices of silver, and you may incur losses when
the causes for the temporary increase disappear. 

In
January 2021, an online campaign intended to harm hedge funds and large banks encouraged retail investors to purchase silver and
shares of Silver ETVs to intentionally increase prices. While this activity is no longer occurring, similar activity in the future
may result in temporarily high prices of silver. 

The
value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the silver held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of silver could
materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The
Shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of silver bullion, and the value of the Shares
relates directly to the value of the silver held by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (including estimated accrued
but unpaid expenses). The price of silver has fluctuated widely over the past several years. Several factors may affect the price
of silver, including: 

A
change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the price of silver. Silver is used in a wide range of
industrial applications, and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, consequently, its price and
the price of the Shares; 

Investors 
 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; 

Currency
 exchange rates; 

Interest
 rates; 

Investment
 and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; 

Global
 or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and 

A
 significant change in investor interest, including in response to online campaigns or
 other activities specifically targeting investments in silver. 

In
addition, investors should be aware that there is no assurance that silver will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing
power in the future. In the event that the price of silver declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares
to decline proportionately. 

23 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE SHARES 

The
sale of the Trust s silver to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust, at
a time of low silver prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 

The
Trustee sells silver held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor on an as-needed basis irrespective of
then-current silver prices. The Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell silver to protect against
or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of silver. Consequently, the Trust s silver may be sold at a time when
the silver price is low, resulting in the sale of more silver than would be required if the Trust sold when prices were higher.
The sale of the Trust s silver to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust,
at a time of low silver prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 

The
value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor or the Trustee under the Trust
Agreement. 

Under
the Trust Agreement, each of the Sponsor and the Trustee has a right to be indemnified from the Trust for any liability or expense
it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance or reckless disregard on its part. That
means the Sponsor or the Trustee may require the assets of the Trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered
by it. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the Trust and the value of the Shares. 

The
Shares may trade at a price which is at, above or below the NAV per Share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative
to the NAV per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca, London and COMEX. 

The
Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV per Share. The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust s
assets. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share as well as market supply and
demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent
trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the major silver markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New
York time, liquidity in the market for silver is reduced after the close of the major world silver markets, including London and
the COMEX. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares, may widen. 

A
possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand of Shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price
volatility in the Shares. 

Investors
may purchase Shares to hedge existing silver exposure or to speculate on the price of silver. Speculation on the price of silver
may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Shares available for purchase
(for example, in the event that large redemption requests by Authorized Participants dramatically affect Share liquidity), investors
with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase Shares for delivery to Share lenders. Those repurchases may in turn,
dramatically increase the price of the Shares until additional Shares are created through the creation process. This is often
referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in Shares that are not directly
correlated to the price of silver. 

In
January of 2021, the Trust and other ETVs that seek to track the price of physical silver bullion Silver ETVs experienced a sudden increase in demand of shares following an online campaign encouraging retail investors to purchase shares
of Silver ETVs as well as physical silver in order to intentionally create a short squeeze. While this activity is no longer currently
occurring, in the future, this type of activity could result in temporarily inflated prices of Shares and the difference between
trading price and NAV per share could widen. 

Purchasing
activity in the silver market associated with the purchase of Baskets from the Trust may cause a temporary increase in the price
of silver. This increase may adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

24 

Purchasing
activity associated with acquiring the silver required for deposit into the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets may
temporarily increase the market price of silver, which will result in higher prices for the Shares. Temporary increases in the
market price of silver may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants. Other market participants
may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of silver that may result from increased purchasing activity of silver
connected with the issuance of Baskets. Consequently, the market price of silver may decline immediately after Baskets
are created. If the price of silver declines, the trading price of the Shares may also decline. 

The
Shares and their value could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise. 

There
may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the Trust s operations and the trading of the Shares
that could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Shares. In addition, although the Trust is not actively managed 
by traditional methods, to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise, the Sponsor s
past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving these problems or issues. 

Discrepancies,
disruptions or unreliability of the LBMA Silver Price could impact the value of the Trust s silver and the market price
of the Shares. 

The
Trustee values the Trust s silver pursuant to the LBMA Silver Price. In the event that the LBMA Silver Price proves to be
an inaccurate benchmark, or the LBMA Silver Price varies materially from the prices determined by other mechanisms for valuing
silver, the value of the Trust s silver and the market price of the Shares could be adversely impacted. Any future developments
in the LBMA Silver Price, to the extent it has a material impact on the LBMA Silver Price, could adversely impact the value of
the Trust s silver and the market price of the Shares. It is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events
may occur that could result in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the benchmark to produce, the LBMA Silver Price
on any given date. Furthermore, any actual or perceived disruptions that result in the perception that the LBMA Silver Price is
vulnerable to actual or attempted manipulation could adversely affect the behavior of market participants, which may have an effect
on the price of silver. If the LBMA Silver Price is unreliable for any reason, the price of silver and the market price for the
Shares may decline or be subject to greater volatility. 

If
the process of creation and redemption of Baskets encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactions
intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of silver may not exist and, as a result, the price of the
Shares may fall. 

If
the processes of creation and redemption of Shares (which depend on timely transfers of silver to and by the Custodian) encounter
any unanticipated difficulties, potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to
take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the price of the underlying
silver may not take the risk that, as a result of those difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect.
If this is the case, the liquidity of Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the price
of silver and may fall. Additionally, redemptions could be suspended for any period during which (1) the NYSE Arca is closed (other
than customary weekend or holiday closings) or trading on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, or (2) an emergency exists
as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of the silver is not reasonably practicable. 

The
liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal from participation of one or more Authorized Participants. 

In
the event that one or more Authorized Participants having substantial interests in Shares or otherwise responsible for a significant
portion of the Shares daily trading volume on the Exchange withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will
likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares and result in Shareholders incurring a loss on their
investment. 

25 

Shareholders
do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or the protections afforded by the CEA. 

The
Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under
such act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies.
The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, commodity interests or any other instruments
regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC and the National Futures Association NFA ). Furthermore, the Trust
is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not commodity interests , and neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection
with the Trust or the Shares. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated
instruments or commodity pools operated by registered commodity pool operators or advised by registered commodity trading
advisors. 

The
Trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders. 

If
the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time which is disadvantageous
to Shareholders, such as when silver prices are lower than the silver prices at the time when Shareholders purchased
their Shares. In such a case, when the Trust s silver is sold as part of the Trust s liquidation, the resulting
proceeds distributed to Shareholders will be less than if silver prices were higher at the time of sale. 

The
lack of an active trading market for the Shares may result in losses on investment at the time of disposition of the Shares. 

Although
Shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, it cannot be assumed that an active trading market for the Shares will develop
or be maintained. If an investor needs to sell Shares at a time when no active market for Shares exists, such lack of an active
market will most likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the Shares (assuming the investor is able to sell
them). 

Shareholders
do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles. 

As
interests in an investment trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares
of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). In
addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors
or approve amendments to the Trust Agreement and do not receive dividends). 

An
investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in silver. 

The
Trust competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the silver
industry and other securities backed by or linked to silver, direct investments in silver and investment vehicles similar
to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor s control, may make it more attractive
to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in silver directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and reduce
the liquidity of the Shares. 

The
amount of silver represented by each Share will decrease over the life of the Trust due to the recurring deliveries of silver
necessary to pay the Sponsor s Fee in-kind and potential sales of silver to pay in cash the Trust expenses not assumed
by the Sponsor. Without increases in the price of silver sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the Shares
will also decline proportionately over the life of the Trust. 

The
amount of silver represented by each Share decreases each day by the Sponsor s Fee. In addition, although the Sponsor
has agreed to assume all organizational and certain administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust (the Trustee s
monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the
Custody Agreements, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per
annum in legal expenses), in exceptional cases certain Trust expenses may need to be paid by the Trust. Because the Trust does
not have any income, it must either make payments in-kind by deliveries of silver (as is the case with the Sponsor s
Fee) or it must sell silver to obtain cash (as in the case of any exceptional expenses). The result of these sales
of silver and recurring deliveries of silver to pay the Sponsor s Fee in-kind is a decrease in the amount of silver
represented by each Share. New deposits of silver, received in exchange for new Shares issued by the Trust, will not reverse this
trend. 

26 

A
decrease in the amount of silver represented by each Share results in a decrease in each Share s price even if the
price of silver bullion does not change. To retain the Share s original price, the price of silver must increase.
Without that increase, the lesser amount of silver represented by the Share will have a correspondingly lower price. If this
increase does not occur, or is not sufficient to counter the lesser amount of silver represented by each Share, Shareholders
will sustain losses on their investment in Shares. 

An
increase in Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or the existence of unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust, will require
the Trustee to sell larger amounts of silver, and will result in a more rapid decrease of the amount of silver represented
by each Share and a corresponding decrease in its value. 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE CUSTODY OF SILVER 

The
Trust s silver may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access. 

There
is a risk that part or all of the Trust s silver could be lost, damaged or stolen. Access to the Trust s silver
could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these
events may adversely affect the operations of the Trust and, consequently, an investment in the Shares. 

The
Trust s lack of insurance protection and the Shareholders limited rights of legal recourse against the Trust, the
Trustee, the Sponsor, the Custodian, and any other sub-custodian exposes the Trust and its Shareholders to the risk of loss of
the Trust s silver for which no person is liable. 

The
Trust does not insure its silver. The Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions as
it considers appropriate in connection with its custodial obligations and is responsible for all costs, fees and expenses arising
from the insurance policy or policies. The Trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate
the existence, nature or amount of coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance
or any insurance with respect to the silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. In addition, the Custodian and
the Trustee do not require or any other direct or indirect sub-custodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial
activities or in respect of the silver held by them on behalf of the Trust. Further, Shareholders recourse against
the Trust, the Trustee and the Sponsor under New York law, the Custodian, and any other sub-custodian under English law, and any
other sub-custodian under the law governing their custody operations is limited. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect
to the Trust s silver which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages. 

The
Custodian s limited liability under the Custody Agreements and English law may impair the ability of the Trust to recover
losses concerning its silver and any recovery may be limited, even in the event of fraud, to the market value of the silver
at the time the fraud is discovered. 

The
liability of the Custodian is limited under the Custody Agreements. Under the Custody Agreements between the Trustee and the Custodian
which establish the Trust s unallocated silver account Unallocated Account and the Trust s allocated silver
account Allocated Account ), the Custodian is only liable for losses that are the direct result of its own negligence,
fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. Any such liability is further limited to the market value of the silver
lost or damaged at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian provided the Custodian notifies
the Trust and the Trustee promptly after the discovery of the loss or damage. Under each Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion
Account Agreement (between the Custodian and an Authorized Participant establishing an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account),
the Custodian is not contractually or otherwise liable for any losses suffered by any Authorized Participant or Shareholder that
are not the direct result of its own gross negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties under such agreement,
and in no event will its liability exceed the market value of the balance in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account at
the time such gross negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian. In addition, the Custodian will not be
liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance of any of its obligations under the Allocated Account Agreement, the
Unallocated Account Agreement or the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement by reason of any cause
beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, war or terrorism. As a result, the recourse of the Trustee or a Shareholder,
under English law, is limited. Furthermore, under English common law, the Custodian, or any other sub-custodian will not
be liable for any delay in the performance or any non-performance of its custodial obligations by reason of any cause beyond its
reasonable control. 

27 

The
obligations of the Custodian, and any other sub-custodians are governed by English law, which may frustrate the Trust in
attempting to seek legal redress against the Custodian, or any other sub-custodian concerning its silver. 

The
obligations of the Custodian under the Custody Agreements are, and the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account
Agreements may be, governed by English law. The Custodian may enter into arrangements with any sub-custodians for the custody
or temporary custody of the Trust s silver, which arrangements may also be governed by English law. The Trust is a
New York common law trust. Any United States, New York or other court situated in the United States may have difficulty interpreting
English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements, is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute), LBMA
rules or the customs and practices in the London custody market. It may be difficult or impossible for the Trust to sue any
sub-custodian in a United States, New York or other court situated in the United States. In addition, it may be difficult, time
consuming and/or expensive for the Trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a United States, New York or other
court situated in the United States. 

The
Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its silver is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed. 

If
the Trust s silver is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Trust,
the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trust s claim. For example, as to a
particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust might be limited to the Custodian, or any other sub-custodian
or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial
resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust. 

Shareholders
and Authorized Participants lack the right under the Custody Agreements to assert claims directly against the Custodian, or any
other sub-custodian. 

Neither
the Shareholders nor any Authorized Participant have a right under the Custody Agreements to assert a claim of the Trust against
the Custodian, or any other sub-custodian. Claims under the Custody Agreements may only be asserted by the Trustee on behalf of
the Trust. 

Because
the Trustee does not, and the Custodian has limited obligations to, oversee or monitor the activities of sub-custodians who may
hold the Trust s silver, failure by the sub-custodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s silver
could result in a loss to the Trust. 

Under
the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian may appoint from time to time one or more sub-custodians to hold the Trust s
silver on a temporary basis pending delivery to the Custodian. The Custodian has selected Malca Amit UK as the sub-custodian for
silver. The Custodian may also use LBMA clearing members that provide bullion vaulting and clearing services to third parties. The
Custodian is required under the Allocated Account Agreement to use reasonable care in appointing its sub-custodians, making the
Custodian liable only for negligence or bad faith in the selection of such sub-custodians, and has an obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of the Trust s silver from any sub-custodians appointed by the Custodian. Otherwise, the
Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions of its sub-custodians. These sub-custodians may in turn appoint further
sub-custodians, but the Custodian is not responsible for the appointment of these further sub-custodians. The Custodian does not
undertake to monitor the performance by sub-custodians of their custody functions or their selection of further sub-custodians. The
Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Custodian other than to review the reports provided by the Custodian pursuant to the
Custody Agreements and does not undertake to monitor the performance of any sub-custodian. 

28 

Furthermore,
the Trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes of examining the Trust s silver
or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian will be obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee
may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such sub-custodian. In addition, the ability
of the Trustee to monitor the performance of the Custodian may be limited because under the Allocated Account Agreement and the
Unallocated Account Agreement the Trustee has only limited rights to visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining
the Trust s silver and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. 

The
obligations of any sub-custodian of the Trust s silver are not determined by contractual arrangements but by LBMA rules
and London silver market customs and practices, which may prevent the Trust s recovery of damages for losses on its silver
custodied with sub-custodians. 

There
are expected to be no written contractual arrangements between sub-custodians that hold the Trust s silver and the Trustee
or the Custodian because traditionally such arrangements are based on the customs and practices of the LBMA and the London bullion
market. In the event of a legal dispute with respect to or arising from such arrangements, it may be difficult to define such
customs and practices. The customs and practices of the LBMA may be subject to change outside the control of the Trust. Under
English law, neither the Trustee nor the Custodian would have a supportable breach of contract claim against a sub-custodian for
losses relating to the safekeeping of silver. If the Trust s silver is lost or damaged while in the custody of a sub-custodian,
the Trust may not be able to recover damages from the Custodian or the sub-custodian. Whether a sub-custodian will be liable for
the failure of sub-custodians appointed by it to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s silver will depend
on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. Shareholders cannot be assured that the Trustee will be able to recover
damages from sub-custodians whether appointed by the Custodian or by another sub-custodian for any losses relating to the safekeeping
of silver by such sub-custodians. 

Silver
bullion allocated to the Trust in connection with the creation of a Basket may not meet the London Good Delivery Standards and,
if a Basket is issued against such silver, the Trust may suffer a loss. 

Neither
the Trustee nor the Custodian independently confirms the fineness of the silver allocated to the Trust in connection with the
creation of a Basket. The silver bullion allocated to the Trust by the Custodian may be different from the reported fineness or
weight required by the LBMA s standards for silver bars delivered in settlement of a silver trade (London Good Delivery
Standards), the standards required by the Trust. If the Trustee nevertheless issues a Basket against such silver, and if
the Custodian fails to satisfy its obligation to credit the Trust the amount of any deficiency, the Trust may suffer a loss. 

Silver
held in the Trust s unallocated silver account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated silver account is not
segregated from the Custodian s assets. If the Custodian becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a
claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the Custodian s insolvency, there may be
a delay and costs incurred in identifying the bullion held in the Trust s allocated silver account. 

Silver
which is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution is held for a time in the Trust Unallocated
Account and, previously or subsequently in, the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account of the purchasing or redeeming Authorized
Participant. During those times, the Trust and the Authorized Participant, as the case may be, have no proprietary rights to any
specific bars of silver held by the Custodian and are each an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount
of silver held in such unallocated accounts. In addition, if the Custodian fails to allocate the Trust s silver in a timely
manner, in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Unallocated Account Agreement, or if a sub-custodian
fails to so segregate silver held by it on behalf of the Trust, unallocated silver will not be segregated from the Custodian s
assets, and the Trust will be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount so held in the event of the insolvency
of the Custodian. In the event the Custodian becomes insolvent, the Custodian s assets might not be adequate to satisfy
a claim by the Trust or the Authorized Participant for the amount of silver held in their respective unallocated silver accounts. 

29 

In
the case of the insolvency of the Custodian, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the silver held in all of the accounts
held by the Custodian, including the Trust Allocated Account. Although the Trust would be able to claim ownership of properly
allocated silver, the Trust could incur expenses in connection with asserting such claims, and the assertion of such a claim by
the liquidator could delay creations and redemptions of Baskets. 

In
issuing Baskets, the Trustee relies on certain information received from the Custodian which is subject to confirmation after
the Trustee has relied on the information. If such information turns out to be incorrect, Baskets may be issued in exchange for
an amount of silver which is more or less than the amount of silver which is required to be deposited with the Trust. 

The
Custodian s definitive records are prepared after the close of its business day. However, when issuing Baskets, the Trustee
relies on information reporting the amount of silver credited to the Trust s accounts which it receives from the Custodian
during the business day and which is subject to correction during the preparation of the Custodian s definitive records
after the close of business. If the information relied upon by the Trustee is incorrect, the amount of silver actually received
by the Trust may be more or less than the amount required to be deposited for the issuance of Baskets. 

GENERAL
RISKS 

The
Trust relies on the information and technology systems of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Marketing Agent and, to a lesser degree,
the Sponsor, which could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions
which could have a material adverse effect on the Trust s record keeping and operations. 

The
Custodian, the Trustee, the Marketing Agent, and the Sponsor depend upon information technology infrastructure, including
network, hardware and software systems to conduct their business as it relates to the Trust. A cybersecurity incident, or a failure
to protect their computer systems, networks and information against cybersecurity threats, could result in a loss of information
and adversely impact their ability to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Trust. Despite implementation
of network and other cybersecurity measures, their security measures may not be adequate to protect against all cybersecurity
threats. 

War,
a major terrorist attack and other geopolitical events, including but not limited to the war between Russia and Ukraine, outbreaks
or public health emergencies (as declared by the World Health Organization), the continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities,
or a prolonged government shutdown may cause volatility in the price of Bullion due to the importance of a country or region to
the Bullion markets, market access restrictions imposed on some local Bullion producers and refiners, potential impacts to global
transportation and shipping and other supply chain disruptions. These events are unpredictable and may lead to extended periods
of price volatility. 

The
operations of the Trust, the exchanges, brokers and counterparties with which the Trust does business, and the markets in which
the Trust does business, could be severely disrupted in the event of war, a major terrorist attack and other geopolitical events,
including but not limited to, the war between Russia and Ukraine, outbreaks or public health emergencies (as declared by the World
Health Organization), the continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities, or a prolonged government shutdown. Such events
may cause volatility in the price of Bullion due to the importance of a country or region to the Bullion markets, market access
restrictions imposed on some local Bullion producers and refiners, or potential impacts to global transportation, shipping, and
other supply chain disruptions. 

30 

In
late February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other
countries in the region and in the West. The responses of countries and political bodies to Russia s actions, the larger
overarching tensions, and Ukraine s military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market
volatility generally, have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of
silver and the share price of the Trust. The conflict in Ukraine, along with global political fallout and implications including
sanctions, shipping disruptions, collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict beyond Ukraine s borders,
could disturb the Bullion markets. Russia is one of the world s largest producers of gold, palladium, platinum and silver.
On March 7, 2022, the LBMA suspended its accreditation of six Russian refiners of gold and silver, and, on April 8, 2022, the
LPPM suspended its accreditation of two Russian refiners of platinum and palladium. The LBMA and LPPM each stated that existing
bars produced by the refiners before their suspension will still be accepted as good delivery. Following an announcement at the
G7 Summit to collectively ban the import of Russian gold, the UK passed regulations which prohibit the direct or indirect (i)
import of gold that originated in Russia, (ii) acquisition of gold that originated in Russia or is located in Russia and (iii)
supply or delivery of gold that originated in Russia, all after July 21, 2022. Similarly, US regulations prohibit the import of
gold of Russian origin into the United States on or after June 28, 2022 and EU regulations prohibit the direct or indirect import,
purchase or transfer of gold if it originates in Russia and has been exported from Russia after July 22, 2022. War and other geopolitical
events in eastern Europe, including but not limited to Russia and Ukraine, may cause volatility in commodity prices including
precious metals prices. These events are unpredictable and may lead to extended periods of price volatility. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to economies and markets around the world, including the markets in which the Trust
invests, and which has and may continue to negatively impact the value of certain of the Trust s investments. Although vaccines
for COVID-19 and variants thereof are becoming more widely available, the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts thereof may continue for
an extended period of time and may vary from market to market. To the extent the impacts of COVID-19 continue, the Trust may experience
negative impacts to its business that could exacerbate other risks to which the Trust is subject. Policy and legislative changes
in countries around the world are affecting many aspects of financial regulation, and governmental and quasi-governmental authorities
and regulators throughout the world have previously responded to serious economic disruptions with a variety of significant fiscal
and monetary policy changes. 

Potential
conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust. 

Conflicts
of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust and its Shareholders, on the other
hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the Trust
and its Shareholders. As an example, the Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging
in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included with this
report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In
some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, should, 
 expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. We remind readers that forward-looking
statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors and involve known and unknown
risks that could cause the actual results, performance, levels of activity, or our achievements, or industry results, to be materially
different from any future results, performance, levels of activity, or our achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the
date hereof. The Trust undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Introduction.

The
Aberdeen Standard Silver ETF Trust (the Trust is a trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust
does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee acting as trustee pursuant to the Depositary Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement between the Trustee and, the
sponsor of the Trust, Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor ). The Trust issues Shares representing
fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist of silver bullion held by a custodian
as an agent of the Trust and responsible only to the Trustee. 

The
Trust is a passive investment vehicle and the objective of the Trust is for the value of each Share to approximately reflect,
at any given time, the price of the silver bullion owned by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (anticipated to be principally
for accrued operating expenses), divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed
to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of silver. 

The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for silver, only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares or integral multiples thereof
(each, a Basket ), and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers (or other securities market participants
not required to register as broker-dealers such as banks or other financial institutions) who (1) are participants in the DTC
and (2) have previously entered into an agreement with the Trust governing the terms and conditions of such issuance (such dealers,
the Authorized Participants ). 

34 

As
of the date of this annual report the Authorized Participants that have signed an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trust
are Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs Co. LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc.,
UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas, LLC. 

Shares
of the Trust trade on the NYSE Arca under the symbol SIVR . 

Investing
in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The following table illustrates the
movement in the NAV of the Shares against the corresponding silver price (per 1 oz. of silver) since inception: 

NAV
per Share vs. Silver Price from July 20, 2009 (the Date of Inception) to December 31, 2022 

The
divergence of the NAV per Share from the silver price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the Trust expenses that arise
if an investment had been held since inception. 

Critical
Accounting Policy 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s
financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting
policies. Below we describe the valuation of silver bullion, a critical accounting policy that we believe is important to understanding
the results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of our accounting policies. 

Valuation
of Silver 

Since
August 15, 2014, an electronic, over-the-counter silver bullion auction has been conducted in London, England to establish a fixing
price for an ounce of silver once each trading day (the LBMA Silver Price ). As of the date of filing,
the LBMA Silver Price is established by the 12 LBMA-authorized bullion banks and market makers participating in the auction and
disseminated by major market vendors. The LBMA Silver Price was initially operated by CME Group, Inc. until October 2, 2017, at
which time the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA commenced administration of the LBMA Silver Price. The
 London Metal Price for silver held by the Trust is the LBMA Silver Price. Realized gains and losses on transfers
of silver, or silver distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated as the difference between the fair value and cost
of silver transferred.

Inspection
of Silver 

Under
the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit
the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s silver and certain related records maintained
by the Custodian. In addition, under the Custody Agreements, the Custodian shall procure that any sub-custodian that it appoints
allows access to its premises during normal business hours to examine the Trust s silver held there and such records as
the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may reasonably require to perform their respective duties
to Shareholders. 

The
Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian in order to examine the silver and the records maintained by them.
Inspections were conducted by Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd, a leading commodity inspection and testing company retained by
the Sponsor, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 

There
can be no guarantee that the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors will be able to perform physical inspections
of the Trust s silver as planned. Local policies, regulations, or ordinances, as well as polices or restrictions adopted
by the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian, may temporarily prevent, or otherwise impair the ability
of, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors, from performing a physical inspection of the Trust s silver
on a desired date. In those situations, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may seek to verify the silver held
by the Trust by alternate means, including through virtual inspections of the Trust s silver and/or a review of pertinent
records. 

Liquidity

The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material
changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses
incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s
Fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its transfers and sales of silver. 

The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s silver as necessary to
pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell silver to pay the Sponsor s
Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through in-kind transfers of silver to the Sponsor. At December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Trust did not have any cash balances.

The
year ended December 31, 2022 

The
Trust s NAV increased from 995,151,629 at December 31, 2021 to 1,118,817,327 at December 31, 2022, a 12.43 increase for
the year. The increase in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from an increase in outstanding Shares, which rose from 44,750,000
Shares at December 31, 2021 to 48,650,000 Shares at December 31, 2022, a result of 15,150,000 Shares (152 Baskets) being created
and 11,250,000 Shares (113 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. There was an increase in the price per ounce of silver, which
rose 3.73 from 23.09 at December 31, 2021 to 23.95 at December 31, 2022. 

NAV
per Share increased 3.42 from 22.24 at December 31, 2021 to 23.00 at December 31, 2022. The Trust s NAV per Share rose
slightly less than the price per ounce of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, which was
 3,061,148 for the year, or 0.30 of the Trust s ANAV. 

The
NAV per Share of 25.20 at March 9, 2022 was the highest during the year, compared with a low of 17.08 at September 1, 2022. 

The
increase in net assets from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 6,279,132, resulting from realized gain of 50,262
on the transfer of silver to pay expenses and a change in unrealized gain on investment in silver of 14,959,321, offset by a
realized loss of 5,669,303 on silver distributed for the redemption of Shares and the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, of
 3,061,148. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
year ended December 31, 2021 

The
Trust s NAV increased from 863,664,235 at December 31, 2020 to 995,151,629 at December 31, 2021, a 15.22 increase for
the year. The increase in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from an increase in outstanding Shares, which rose from 33,750,000
Shares at December 31, 2020 to 44,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2021, a result of 12,950,000 Shares (259 Baskets) being created
and 1,950,000 Shares (39 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. There was a decrease in the price per ounce of silver, which
fell 12.84 from 26.49 at December 31, 2020 to 23.09 at December 31, 2021. 

NAV
per Share decreased 13.09 from 25.59 at December 31, 2020 to 22.24 at December 31, 2021. The Trust s NAV per Share fell

 593,507 on the transfer of silver to pay expenses and a realized gain of 14,271,606 on silver distributed for the redemption
of Shares, offset by a change in unrealized gain and loss on investment in silver of 155,164,485, and the Sponsor s Fee,
net of waiver, of 2,968,351. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the year ended December 31,

the year. The increase in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from an increase in outstanding Shares, which rose from 23,300,000
Shares at December 31, 2019 to 33,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2020, a result of 11,500,000 Shares (230 Baskets) being created
and 1,050,000 Shares (21 Baskets) being redeemed during the year and an increase in the price per ounce of silver, which rose
46.77 from 18.05 at December 31, 2019 to 26.49 at December 31, 2020. 

NAV
per Share increased 46.31 from 17.49 at December 31, 2019 to 25.59 at December 31, 2020. The Trust s NAV per Share rose
slightly less than the price per ounce of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, which was
 1,787,310 for the year, or 0.30 of the Trust s ANAV. 

37 

The
NAV per Share of 27.94 at September 1, 2020 was the highest during the year, compared with a low of 11.63 at March 19, 2020. 

The
increase in net assets from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 261,211,613, resulting from a change in unrealized
gain on investment in silver of 258,078,973, a realized gain of 174,027 on the transfer of silver to pay expenses,
and a realized gain of 4,745,923 on silver distributed for the redemption of Shares, offset by the Sponsor s Fee, net of

Item

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

The
Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, the
Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Internal
controls over financial reporting have been maintained throughout the Trust s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There
have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or Sponsor s
internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Sponsor s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trust s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
Trust s assets; 

(2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with appropriate authorizations; and 

(3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Their
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting and testing of
the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

KPMG
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the financial statements included in this
Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is included herein, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Trust s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Sponsor, Trustee and Shareholders 
abrdn Silver
ETF Trust: 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 We
have audited abrdn Silver ETF Trust's (known as Aberdeen Standard Silver ETF Trust prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust) internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the statements of assets and liabilities of the Trust, including the
schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and the financial
highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the financial
statements), and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

 The Trust s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Trust s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

 A company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT

To the Sponsor, Trustee and Shareholders 
abrdn Silver
ETF Trust: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We
have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of abrdn Silver ETF Trust (known as Aberdeen Standard Silver ETF Trust
prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust), including the schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements
of operations and changes in net assets and the financial highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2022, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in
its net assets and financial highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter
arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence
of the silver holdings 

 As presented on the December 31, 2022 schedule of investments
and in Note 2.2, the fair value of the Trust s investment in silver is 1,113,348 thousand, representing 99.51 of the Trust s
net assets, and 46,496,068 ounces of silver holdings. The investment in silver was held by a third-party custodian (the custodian). 

We identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining
to the existence of the silver holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the silver holdings, subjective auditor
judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the existence of silver held by the custodian. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to
address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related
to the critical audit matter. This included controls over (1) the comparison of the Trust s records of silver held to the custodian s
records, (2) the approval of silver deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of the Trust and (3) the physical counts of the Trust s
silver holdings performed at the custodian s locations by a third party engaged by the Trust s sponsor. We obtained a schedule
directly from the custodian of the Trust s silver holdings held by the custodian as of December 31, 2022. We compared the total
ounces on such schedule to the Trust s record of silver holdings. We also attended and observed a part of the physical counts of
the Trust s silver holdings. We obtained and read the physical counts results reports of the third party and reconciled those reports
to both the Trust s and custodian s records.

Silver ETF Trust 

Notes
to the Financial Statements 

Shares (also referred to as Baskets in exchange for deposits of silver and
distributes silver in connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial
interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and
a wholly-owned subsidiary of abrdn Inc. abrdn Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of abrdn (formerly known as Standard
Life Aberdeen) plc. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement. 

The
investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of silver, less the Trust s
expenses and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a Shareholder an opportunity to participate in the silver market through an investment in securities. 

of the Trust s silver was held by a sub-custodian. 

The
Trust s silver is recorded at fair value. The cost of silver is determined according to the average cost method and the
fair value is based on the London Bullion Market Association LBMA Silver Price. Realized gains and losses
on transfers of silver, or silver distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference
between the fair value and average cost of silver transferred. 

The
ICE Benchmark Administration IBA conducts an electronic, over-the-counter silver auction in London, England to
establish a fixing price for an ounce of silver once each trading day, which is disseminated by major market vendors (the LBMA
Silver Price ). The LBMA Silver Price is established by the LBMA-authorized bullion banks and market makers participating
in the auction. 

Once
the value of silver has been determined, the net asset value (the NAV is computed by the Trustee by
deducting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s
Fee ), from the fair value of the silver and all other assets held by the Trust. 

The
Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment in silver as changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment
in silver through the Statement of Operations. 

The
per Share amount of silver exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee using the LBMA Silver
Price to calculate the silver amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering silver sales have not yet been
made, and represents the per Share amount of silver held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses
and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred. 

Fair
Value Hierarchy 

ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs
are as follows: 

Level
1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level
2. Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly
or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on
an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data. 

Level
3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing
the Trust s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability,
and that would be based on the best information available. 

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for
instruments categorized in level 3. 

The
inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The
Trust s investment in silver is classified as a level 1 asset, as its value is calculated using unadjusted
quoted prices from primary market sources. 

There
were no transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

of silver receivable
for the creation of Shares and silver payable for the redemption of Shares. At December 31, 2021, the Trust
had silver receivable or payable for the creation or redemption of Shares. 

Shares).
The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem
Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other
securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer
to engage in securities transactions; (2) is a participant in The Depository Trust Company; (3) has entered into an Authorized
Participant Agreement with the Trustee and the Sponsor; and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account
with the Trust s Custodian or other silver bullion clearing bank. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement
entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption
of Baskets and for the delivery of the silver required for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account is an unallocated silver account established with the Custodian or a silver bullion clearing bank
by an Authorized Participant. 

The
creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of
the amount of silver represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV
of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem
Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized
Participants may, on any business day, place an order with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. The typical settlement
period for Shares is two business days. In the event of a trade date at period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective
account receivable and/or payable will be recorded. When silver is exchanged in settlement of a redemption, it is considered
a sale of silver for financial statement purposes. 

The
amount of silver represented by the Baskets created or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce.
As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption of Shares may differ from the value of silver to be
delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the correct amount of silver is available at all times to
back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its management fees in the event of any shortfall or excess on each transaction.
For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th of an ounce of silver. 

As
the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding
Shares as Net Assets. Changes in the number of Shares outstanding are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. 

reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

of the adjusted daily net asset value ANAV of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. Presently, the Sponsor
is continuing to voluntarily waive a portion of its fee and reduce the Sponsor s Fee to (which it has done since the
Date of Inception). 

The
Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly
fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing
fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs,
audit fees and up to per annum in legal expenses. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Sponsor s Fee, net of fees waived by the Sponsor, was ,
 and , respectively. 

At December
31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021, the fees payable to the Sponsor were and , respectively. 

As
a result of the waiver, the Sponsor s Fee waived for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020 was , and , respectively. 

With
respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion,
sell the Trust s silver as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling silver to pay expenses, the Trustee will
endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of silver needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings
of assets other than silver. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had expenses during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. 

Unless
otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling silver the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the
LBMA. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive
the most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such silver only if the sale transaction
is made at the next LBMA Silver Price or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set
following the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost
of the silver sold. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized
gains and losses result from the transfer of silver for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on
a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and average cost of silver transferred.
