 PART I 
 Item 1. Business 
 IMAX Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company , or IMAX is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation Predecessor IMAX ). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company indirectly owns 71.73 of IMAX China Holding, Inc. IMAX China ), whose shares trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. IMAX China is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 GENERAL 
 IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property, and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end solution to create superior, immersive content experiences for which the IMAX brand is globally renowned. Top filmmakers, movie studios, artists, and creators utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways. As a result, IMAX is among the most important and successful global distribution platforms for domestic and international tentpole films and, increasingly, exclusive experiences ranging from live performances to interactive events with leading artists and creators. 
 The Company leverages its proprietary technology and engineering in all aspects of its business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other content into the IMAX format IMAX DMR and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems IMAX System(s) ). 
 IMAX Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company s history since its founding in 1967. The customers for IMAX Systems are principally theater exhibitors that operate commercial multiplex theaters, and, to a much lesser extent, museums, science centers and destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the locations in the IMAX network, and is not an exhibitor, but instead sells or leases the IMAX System to exhibitor customers along with a license to use its trademarks and ongoing maintenance services. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were 1,716 IMAX Systems operating in 87 countries and territories, including 1,633 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 71 institutional locations in the Company's global network. This compares to 1,683 IMAX Systems operating in 87 countries and territories as of December 31, 2021, including 1,599 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 72 institutional locations in the Company's global network. (See the table below under Marketing and Customers for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.) 
 The IMAX System provides the Company s exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits: 
 the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences; 

advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems; 

large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer s peripheral vision and creates more realistic images; 

advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in a theater equipped with an IMAX System; 

specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; 

ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services, and 

a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand. 

4 
 
 In addition, certain movies shown in the IMAX network are filmed using proprietary IMAX film cameras or IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and an IMAX-exclusive film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26 more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX locations worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, with up to 67 more image. 
 Together, these components cause audiences in IMAX locations to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive, and exciting experience than a traditional theater. 
 As a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience , the Company's exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX films, generates incremental box office for the Company's exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood and foreign local language movie studios. 
 The Company concluded 2022 with the release of Avatar: The Way of Water on December 16, 2022 which became the Company's highest grossing release of 2022 by earning 140.2 million of gross box office GBO (or 11 market share) during the year ended December 31, 2022. This momentum has carried over into 2023 throughout the remainder of the film's theatrical run with its cumulative GBO of approximately 250 million, cementing the title as the highest global first run IMAX release of all time, and the top performing IMAX release of all time in 48 countries to date. 
 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative IMAX Live TM events and experiences to audiences worldwide. The Company has a footprint of connected IMAX Systems capable of delivering live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. As of December 31, 2022, 253 systems in the IMAX network across North America, Europe and Asia were configured with connectivity to deliver live and interactive events. 
 As a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. The Company offers a suite of IMAX Laser Systems, which deliver increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast and the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that its suite of IMAX Laser Systems are helping facilitate the next major renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network. 
 In September 2022, the Company acquired SSIMWAVE Inc. SSIMWAVE ), a Canadian company, a leader in AI-driven video quality solutions for media and entertainment companies. The acquisition of SSIMWAVE marks a significant expansion of the Company's strategy to deliver the highest quality images on any screen to drive new, recurring revenue and grow its global leadership in entertainment technology. (See SSIMWAVE under Sources of Revenue - All Other in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information related to the Company's acquisition of SSIMWAVE.) 
 IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to prevent its spread have impacted the Company s business and the global economy. Capacity restrictions and safety protocols were lifted then reinstituted at various points since the third quarter of 2020. Although normal operations have resumed in most key markets and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network, the Company s business continues to experience impact from COVID-19. For example, following the emergence of the Omicron variant and the rise of COVID-19 cases in China in the first quarter of 2022, the Chinese government reinstituted capacity restrictions and safety protocols on large public gatherings and enforced a dynamic zero-COVID policy, which led to the temporary lock-down of various cities and temporary closure of theaters in these cities. At the end of 2022, the Chinese government relaxed its dynamic zero-COVID policies and significantly eased restrictions. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 97 of the IMAX network in Greater China was open at various capacities. For additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s business, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. 
 (See Risk Factors The Company experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 5 
 
 IMAX NETWORK 
 The Company believes the IMAX network is one of the most extensive premium networks in the world with 1,716 IMAX Systems operating in 87 countries and territories, including 1,633 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations and 71 institutional locations as of December 31, 2022. (See the table below under IMAX Network and Backlog in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.) 
 The Company currently believes that over time its commercial multiplex network could grow to over 3,300 IMAX Systems worldwide from the 1,633 IMAX Systems in the network as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2022, 75 of IMAX Systems in the global commercial multiplex network were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada). Revenues and GBO derived from international markets continue to exceed revenues and GBO from the United States and Canada. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's revenue generated from its Greater China operations represents 24 of consolidated revenue, compared to 44 in 2021 and 38 in 2020 due to the impact of restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 794 IMAX Systems operating in Greater China with an additional 204 systems in backlog. The Company s backlog in Greater China represents 45 of its total current backlog, including upgrades in system type. The Company has a partnership in China with Wanda Film Wanda ). As of December 31, 2022, through the Company s partnership with Wanda, there were 375 IMAX Systems operational in Greater China, of which 361 are under the parties joint revenue sharing arrangements. 
 (See Risk Factors Risks associated with the Company s international business are outlined in Risk Factors The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects , Risk Factors The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there , Risk Factors General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Company s business by reducing both revenues generated from existing IMAX Systems and the demand for new IMAX Systems , and Risk Factors The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 The Company believes it is the world s largest designer and manufacturer of specialty premium projection and sound system components for large-format theaters around the world, and it is also a significant distributor of large-format films. 
 The Company s principal products and services are as follows: 
 
 IMAX DMR The digital remastering of films and other content into IMAX formats for distribution to the IMAX network. 

IMAX Systems The sale or lease of premium IMAX Systems to exhibitor customers. 

IMAX Maintenance The provision of preventative and emergency maintenance services to the IMAX network.

 IMAX DMR 
 IMAX DMR is a proprietary technology that digitally remasters films into IMAX formats. IMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited across the IMAX network is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position. 
 The IMAX DMR process involves: 
 
 in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image; 

optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools; 

enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts; 

recording the enhanced digital image into an IMAX digital cinema package DCP format or onto IMAX 15/70-format film; and 

specially remastering the soundtrack to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX Systems. 

IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as IMAX DNA . Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience's immersion in the film and to take advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26 more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX locations worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, with up to 67 more image. The Company has a Filmed For IMAX TM program under which filmmakers craft films from their inception in various ways in order to optimize The IMAX Experience and includes incremental and bespoke marketing support, which box office metrics demonstrate audiences respond extremely favorably to. 
 Management believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company is focused on the expansion of the IMAX network and has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing its slate of Hollywood films with appealing local language films released in select markets, including China, Japan, India, and South Korea.

 The Company remains in active negotiations with studios for additional films to fill out its short- and long-term film slate for the IMAX network. The Company also expects to announce additional local language films to be released to its global network throughout 2023. 
 IMAX Systems 
 The Company s primary products are its various digital projection systems, which are either sold or leased to exhibitor customers along with a license for the use of the globally recognized IMAX brand. The Company s digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, in certain situations, 3D glasses and cleaning equipment. IMAX s digital projection systems also operate without the need for analog film prints. The Company s digital projection systems provide a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing exhibitor customers with the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords. 
 As part of the arrangement to sell or lease an IMAX System, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design, and supervision of installation services. The terms of each sale or lease arrangement vary according to the configuration of the IMAX System, as well as the cinema and film distribution markets relevant to the geographic location of the customer. 
 Revenue from the sale or lease of an IMAX System may be recognized at a different time from when cash is collected from the exhibitor customer. (See Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3(o) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on the Company s revenue recognition policies.) 
 The following table presents the number of IMAX Systems that are open and in backlog, by configuration, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

IMAX Laser Systems 
 In 2014, the Company introduced its first laser-based digital projection system. Since then, the Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. Beginning in 2021, the Company began offering an additional laser-based system product to provide a broader array of customers with an opportunity to replace and upgrade IMAX Xenon Systems. The Company believes that IMAX Laser Systems present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, consume less power and last longer than other digital projection technologies, and are capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX network. 
 IMAX Xenon Systems 
 In 2008, the Company introduced its digital IMAX Xenon System. Prior to 2008, all of the IMAX Systems offered by the Company were film-based and required analog film prints. The Company believes that IMAX Xenon Systems deliver higher quality imagery when compared with IMAX Film Systems. 
 IMAX Film Systems 
 IMAX Film Systems include various configurations, including 2D and 3D systems, and screen sizes. Following the introduction of the digital IMAX Xenon System in 2008, the number of IMAX Film Systems in the IMAX network has decreased significantly.

(1) Includes 38 IMAX Systems (2021 44) where the customer has the option to convert from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sales arrangement. 

(2) The consideration owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are accounted for as leases, is typically contingent on the box office receipts earned by the exhibitor. Accordingly, such arrangements do not usually have a dollar value in backlog; however, certain joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. 

(3) As of December 31, 2022, the Company's backlog includes 14 systems in Russia, one system in Ukraine, and five systems in Belarus with a total fixed contracted value of 22.9 million. 

The number of IMAX Systems in backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog, and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. The dollar value of backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX System sale and lease agreements that the Company expects to recognize as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements. The value of backlog does not include amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues or revenue from IMAX Systems in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, and long-term conditional theater commitments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX System installations that are listed in the backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue. (See Risk Factors The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows. in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 Certain of the Company s contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing, but before installation. The current backlog information reflects all known elections. 
 IMAX Maintenance 
 IMAX System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee paid by the exhibitor. Under these arrangements, the Company provides preventative and emergency maintenance services to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the system agreements. (See Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services below.)

 Other Products and Services 
 Film Distribution and Post-Production 
 The Company distributes large-format documentary films, primarily to institutional theaters. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and, following the recoupment of its costs, is typically entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues. In March 2022, the Company released the IMAX documentary film entitled IMAX presents The Last Glaciers. 
 The ownership rights to such films may be held by the film sponsors, the film investors and/or the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has distribution rights with respect to 55 films, which cover subjects such as space, wildlife, music, sports, history and natural wonders. 
 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative IMAX Live events and experiences to audiences worldwide. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a footprint of 253 connected locations in the IMAX network across the United States, Canada, and Europe configured with connectivity to deliver live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. 
 In 2022, the Company partnered with Disney for a live Q A with director and producer Peter Jackson, followed by a special screening of The Beatles: Get Back The Rooftop Concert , which was later released across the IMAX global network. Additionally, the Company presented Brandi Carlile: In The Canyon Haze - Live from Laurel Canyon , a one-night-only live concert performing her new deluxe album In The Canyon Haze for the very first time, in connected locations across the United States, among various other live events and special screenings presented throughout 2022. 
 The Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content. 
 The Company also provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films, whether produced by IMAX or third parties, and digital post-production services.

 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
 Competition 
 The out-of-home entertainment industry is very diverse with numerous companies vying for the public s leisure time and the Company faces significant competition as a consequence. Within the theatrical space, exhibitors and entertainment technology companies have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums or other proprietary theater systems, some of which include laser-based projectors, and in many cases, have marketed those auditoriums or theater systems as having similar quality or attributes to an IMAX System. The Company believes that all of these alternative formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience and do not have IMAX s brand trust, filmmaker endorsement, loyal fan base, or global footprint. 
 The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative film distribution channels such as subscription streaming services, transactional video-on-demand (both rentals and sales), advertiser-supported video-on-demand, internet, and broadcast and cable television. The Company further competes for the public s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants. Furthermore, the Company may continue to face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or greater capital resources to develop and support them. 
 The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX Systems (including the quality of the sound system components included with an IMAX System), the return on investment of an IMAX System for exhibitors, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood and international filmmakers and other content creators (a number of whom desire to film their movies and events with IMAX cameras), the availability of Hollywood and international films to the IMAX network through IMAX DMR technology, the availability of unique and innovative events and experiences such as distributed concerts, special theatrical screenings, and live Q A sessions with top content creators, consumer loyalty and the level of the Company s service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its most recent laser-based projection systems further increase the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. 
 Exhibitor Consolidation 
 The Company s primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors. Since 2016, the commercial exhibition industry has undergone significant consolidation, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. s AMC acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and Odeon UCI Cinemas Group Odeon ), which includes Nordic Cinema Group Nordic ), and Cineworld Group plc's Cineworld acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group Regal ). 
 The Company believes that the consolidation of the commercial exhibition industry has helped facilitate the growth of the IMAX network. The Company has historically enjoyed strong relationships with large commercial exhibitor chains, which have greater capital to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire IMAX Systems. As larger commercial chains such as AMC and Cineworld have purchased smaller chains, those smaller chains have in turn become part of the IMAX network. For instance, following AMC s acquisition of Odeon and Nordic, the Company and AMC entered into an agreement for 25 new IMAX Systems across the Odeon and Nordic network. The Company believes that continued consolidation could facilitate further signings and other strategic benefits going forward. 
 However, exhibitor consolidation has also resulted in individual exhibitor chains constituting a material portion of the Company s revenue and network. Continued industry consolidation, as well as consolidation in the movie studio industry, may present risks to the Company. (See Risk Factors Consolidation among commercial exhibitors and studios reduces the breadth of the Company s customer base, and could result in a narrower market for the Company s products and reduced negotiating leverage. A deterioration in the Company s relationship with key partners could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or results of operation. In addition, an adverse economic impact on a significant customer s business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Company. in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 On September 7, 2022, Cineworld, the parent company of Regal, and certain of its subsidiaries and Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC, filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. On October 21, 2022, the Company was ratified by the bankruptcy court as a critical vendor of Cineworld, allowing the Company to collect pre-petition amounts owed to it by Cineworld, and requiring Cineworld to stay current on the Company s post-petition receivables. On November 8, 2022, Cineworld and the Company entered into a Trade Agreement setting forth a payment plan for amounts owed by Cineworld to the Company. The Company has determined that no additional provision for expected credit losses is required. The Company also does not expect to see a material impact on its IMAX network with Cineworld resulting from this reorganization. (See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 for additional information.)

 THE IMAX BRAND 
 IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers, studios, and other content creators use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. The Company has a Filmed For IMAX program under which filmmakers craft films from their inception in various ways in order to optimize The IMAX Experience , which box office metrics demonstrate audiences respond extremely favorably to. IMAX certifies high-end, best-in-class digital cameras with leading brands including ARRI, Panavision, RED Digital Cinema and Sony to work in the IMAX format. These cameras are used by filmmakers and studios to capture content at a high bit rate file format which is then paired with the Company s proprietary post-production process. The Filmed For IMAX program includes incremental and bespoke marketing support to drive higher market share results. 
 The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what today s movie audiences crave a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. From 2015 to 2019, the Company commissioned leading third-party research firms to conduct multiple consumer research studies in 11 countries. The studies show that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience for the audience, and is one of the most differentiated movie-going brands. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to 10 times more powerful than other entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 The Company believes that it is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering, and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. The Company's flagship laser-based projection system is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the Company s network. This laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. The Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. Beginning in 2021, the Company began offering an additional laser-based system product to provide a broader array of customers with an opportunity to replace and upgrade IMAX Xenon Systems. 
 The Company intends to continue research and development to further evolve its end-to-end technology. This includes bringing connectivity to the Company s global network and experimenting with live and interactive events worldwide; developing new IMAX film cameras and certifying additional digital cameras; further improving its proprietary DMR process for the delivery of content for both theatrical and home entertainment; and further improving the reliability of its projectors, as well as enhancing the Company s image and sound quality. With the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, there is ongoing research and development in perceptual metrics including novel measurement and optimization techniques. Teams are working to expand existing and/or develop new technologies which are expected to further enhance video quality, delivery, and creation across devices. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 66 of the Company s employees were connected with research and development projects, including SSIMWAVE employees, as compared to 34 employees as of December 31, 2021. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE 
 Projector Component Manufacturing 
 The Company assembles IMAX System projectors at its facility in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto). With a few exceptions, the Company develops and designs all of the key elements of the proprietary technology involved in this component. The fabrication of a majority of parts and sub-assemblies is subcontracted to a group of carefully pre-qualified third-party suppliers. Manufacture and supply contracts are signed for the delivery of the component on an order-by-order basis. The Company believes its significant suppliers will continue to supply quality products in quantities sufficient to satisfy its needs. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly, and then subjects the projector to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. Historically, these projectors, including both IMAX Laser Systems and IMAX Xenon Systems, have had reliability rates based on scheduled shows of approximately 99 . 
 15 
 
 Sound System Component Manufacturing 
 The Company develops, designs, and assembles the key elements of the theater sound system component. The standard IMAX sound system component consists of parts from a variety of sources, with approximately 50 of the materials of each sound system attributable to proprietary parts provided under original equipment manufacturers agreements with outside vendors. These proprietary parts include custom loudspeaker enclosures and horns, specialized amplifiers, and signal processing and control equipment. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the sound system to comprehensive testing as a system. 
 Screen and Other Components 
 The Company purchases its screen components and glasses cleaning equipment from third parties. The standard screen system component consists of a projection screen manufactured to IMAX specifications and a frame to hang the projection screen. The proprietary glasses cleaning machine is a stand-alone unit that is connected to the theater s water and electrical supply to automate the cleaning of 3D glasses. 
 Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services 
 The Company provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services to IMAX Systems. These arrangements are usually for a separate fee, although the Company sometimes includes free service in the initial year of the arrangement. The maintenance and extended warranty arrangements include service, maintenance and replacement parts for IMAX Systems. 
 To support the IMAX network, the Company has personnel stationed in major markets throughout the world who provide periodic and emergency maintenance and extended warranty services on existing IMAX Systems. The Company provides various levels of maintenance and warranty services, which are priced accordingly. Under full-service programs, Company personnel typically visit each theater every six to twelve months to provide preventative maintenance, cleaning and inspection services and emergency visits to resolve problems and issues with the system. Under some arrangements, customers can elect to participate in a service partnership program whereby the Company trains a customer s technician to carry out certain aspects of maintenance. Under such shared maintenance arrangements, the Company participates in certain of the customer s maintenance checks each year, provides a specified number of emergency visits and provides spare parts, as necessary. For both IMAX Laser Systems and IMAX Xenon Systems, the Company provides pre-emptive maintenance, remote system monitoring and a network operations center that provides continuous access to product experts.

 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 The Company believes that effective human capital management is critical to its success. The Company's human capital management objectives are 1) attracting, engaging, and retaining exceptional talent who are passionate about IMAX s business; and 2) fostering a work environment that unites diverse teams around our mission to connect the world through extraordinary experiences that inspire us to reimagine what s possible together. 
 To achieve these objectives, the Company s people and culture strategy focuses on creating a compelling employee brand which inspires top talent to join the Company; engaging its employee base to maximize overall performance and enhance retention; offering a competitive total rewards program (the Total Rewards Program ); developing and refining a diversity, equity, and inclusion DE I plan that is unique to its business; and continuing its focus on employee safety. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 779 people, of which approximately 286 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 493 were employed outside of the U.S. The global workforce consists of approximately 96 full-time and 4 part-time employees. 
 Some of the recent initiatives to achieve the Company s human capital management objectives include the following: 
 Recruiting Talent 
 The Company believes that developing a workforce of individuals from diverse backgrounds with varying perspectives, experiences, and skills is essential in meeting the demands of its industry and the market. In 2022, the Company focused on defining key elements of our employee value proposition and incorporating them into a new and consistent approach to employee onboarding. Additionally, the Company facilitated DE I training for hiring managers to ensure the Company's interview and hiring processes are fair and equitable. The Company also expanded its outreach efforts to various multicultural job boards and associations and built stronger partnerships with regional unemployment agencies, universities and colleges, and IMAX alumni to diversify its sources of potential candidates. 
 Engaging Employees 
 In 2022, the Company engaged its leaders through a series of meetings and activities to build a workforce plan strategy. 
 As part of this initiative, the Company continued to support and develop its employees and their skillsets through a variety of training and development programs that build and strengthen leadership and professional skills, including an education reimbursement program, career development planning, and in-house learning opportunities that support its people as they grow in their careers. 
 To monitor employee satisfaction and engagement, the Company conducts employee engagement surveys. The last employee engagement survey was conducted in 2021, and the Company expects to conduct an employee engagement survey in 2023. 
 Additionally, to foster greater connection to our mission, employee engagement, collaboration, and a positive work culture, the Company welcomed employees back to the office on a regular basis. While providing employees the flexibility they need to balance their personal and professional responsibilities and generous paid time off benefits, this policy has enabled our workforce to quickly return to a sense of normalcy post-pandemic while furthering the Company s objective of increasing employee collaboration. 
 Total Rewards 
 The Company takes a holistic view of the Total Rewards Program, focusing on providing competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract, incentivize, and retain a talented, diverse, multi-generational workforce. 
 The Total Rewards Program balances base compensation, incentive compensation for both short-term and long-term performance, and a focus on total well-being of the employee. Its recent efforts to improve the Total Rewards Program include the following: 
 In 2022, short-term incentive targets were increased in response to the external competitive environment, strengthening the Company's pay-for-performance culture. 

An overall global benefits review was launched in 2022 with a specific focus on U.S. benefits to create further affordability, flexibility, and choice. The Company expects to implement enhancements to its U.S. benefits program in certain regions in 2023 based on employee feedback and market conditions. 

17 
 
 With an increased focus on mental health in light of the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company enhanced its health and family-friendly benefits to provide mental health support and access to mental health practitioners to its employees. 

The Company supports new parents, including adoptive parents, with maternity and parental leave benefits. Additionally, in 2022, the Company launched a new corporate partnership to provide a company-subsidized benefit for emergency backup childcare, ongoing childcare, elder care, and pet care to strengthen its commitment to its employees overall well-being. 

In 2022, the Company reinstated its annual well-being fair for its employees (focusing on the four pillars of well-being: financial, physical, social, and physiological) and launched a new corporate partnership to promote physical fitness and self-care. 

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 In 2022, the Company continued its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Company established an executive sponsorship committee to promote our DE I strategy, which focuses on the following areas: 
 Raising awareness and educating its employees and affiliates on social issues that are important to its stakeholders. 

Empowering and encouraging the Company s employees and leadership to be champions of diversity, equity, and inclusion by encouraging inclusive behaviors and frequent feedback and input. 

Communicating and connecting with its workforce using inclusive and concise messages. 

Ensuring that equal opportunity and diversity of people is non-negotiable in how the Company attracts, selects, supports, develops, and rewards its employees, and in whom the Company chooses to partner with. 

The Company provided three additional personal days to its workforce to encourage employee well-being. 

In 2022, employees were given an opportunity to participate in global focus groups aimed at advancing the Company's commitment to empowering its employees and establishing a roadmap for the future of its culture and organization. The Company plans to use the feedback collected during these focus groups to inform its priorities in 2023. 
 The Company provided forums for employees to discuss the impact of the pandemic on them and their communities, opportunities to have conversations about systemic racism, and hosted a Speaker Series in 2022, which included representatives from The Trevor Project, an organization that provides crisis support to LGBTQ young people, and Outfest, a leading LGBTQIA+ arts and entertainment organization. 
 As of December 31, 2022, women represented approximately 34 of the Company s global workforce. The Company currently has one female director (12.5 and one director who identifies as a member of a visible minority (12.5 on the Board of Directors (the Board ). In addition, recruiting efforts are underway to identify additional female director(s) to join to the Board, creating greater diversity and increasing representation. There are 6 (33 female members of the Company s management team of 18 as well as 5 (28 members of the Company s management team who identify as ethnically diverse. 
 Employee Safety 
 Risks to the safety of employees are present in day-to-day office work, building renovation, manufacturing, logistics, training, testing, research, and development, and during the designing, installation, and servicing of IMAX Systems around the world. The Company has implemented a global program for workplace safety that ensures it has the necessary controls in place to keep its employees and visitors safe. Every employee is responsible for participating in workplace safety planning activities, and managers are responsible for employee safety program implementation within their business function. This effort is supported by a cross-functional team dedicated to employee health and safety and business continuity. 
 Additionally, in 2022, the Company completed an assessment of its physical workplace and identified several initiatives in the categories of real estate, workplace design, workplace operations, workplace culture, and enterprise alignment to create a safe and inclusive environment. We anticipate implementing these initiatives throughout 2023 and 2024. 
 18 
 
 This continuous focus on and commitment to the health and safety of the Company s employees has remained central to the Company s response to COVID-19. Specifically, the Company: 
 Implemented and monitored COVID-19 safety protocols in accordance with applicable health guidance, which included an enhanced cleaning protocol, provision of personal protective equipment, and designing of workplace arrangements to promote safety; instituted a cross-functional Pandemic Response team to support decision making and implementation of COVID-19 response programs; 

Adhered to an illness reporting process to protect its employees from the spread of COVID-19; and 

Provided resources and tools to help employees navigate the changing and challenging environment during and post-pandemic.

 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Before you make an investment decision with respect to the Company s common stock, you should carefully consider all of the information included in this Form 10-K and the Company s subsequent periodic filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to Forward Looking Statements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this annual report. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks that the Company currently deems immaterial or that are currently unknown to the Company may also impair its business or operations. 
 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS 
 The Company experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings, and cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to prevent its spread have impacted the Company s business and the global economy. Capacity restrictions and safety protocols were lifted then reinstituted at various points since the third quarter of 2020. Although normal operations have resumed in most key markets and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network, the Company s business continues to experience impact from COVID-19. For example, following the emergence of the Omicron variant and the rise of COVID-19 cases in China in the first quarter of 2022, the Chinese government reinstituted capacity restrictions and safety protocols on large public gatherings and enforced a dynamic zero-COVID policy, which led to the temporary lock-down of various cities and the temporary closure of theaters in these cities. At the end of 2022, the Chinese government relaxed its dynamic zero-COVID policies and significantly eased restrictions. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 97 of the IMAX network in Greater China was open at various capacities. 
 There remains uncertainty around whether and when movie-going will return to historical levels. The timing and extent of a recovery of consumer behavior and willingness to spend discretionary income on movie-going may delay the Company's ability to generate significant revenue from GBO generated by its exhibitor customers until consumer behavior normalizes and consumer spending fully recovers. 
 As a result of the financial difficulties faced by certain of the Company's exhibitor customers arising out of pandemic-related theater closures, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing IMAX System sale or lease arrangements. The Company's exhibitor partners may continue to experience operational and/or financial difficulties if the COVID-19 pandemic continues or consumers change their behavior and consumption patterns, which would further increase the risks associated with payments due under existing agreements with the Company. The ability of such partners to make payments cannot be guaranteed and is subject to changing economic circumstances. For example, on September 7, 2022, Cineworld and certain of its subsidiaries and Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview in Part II, Item 7). Further, the Company has had to delay certain IMAX system installations from backlog and may be required to further delay or cancel such installations in the future. As a result, the Company's future revenues and cash flows have been, and may in the future continue to be adversely affected. 
 Given the dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's financial condition, liquidity, business and results of operations in future reporting periods. The extent and duration of such impact on the Company will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence, spread and severity of variants of the virus, the effectiveness of such vaccines and treatments, the progress towards the resumption of normal operations of movie theaters worldwide and their return to historical levels of attendance, consumer behavior, the solvency of the Company's exhibitor partners and, their ability to make timely payments, any potential construction or installation delays involving the Company's exhibitor partners, the continuing impact of the pandemic on global economic conditions and ongoing government responses to the pandemic. Such events are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately forecasted. To the extent that the Company experiences material negative impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in future periods, especially if such impacts are prolonged, its liquidity needs may increase materially and its ability to maintain compliance with certain covenants under its credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank may be jeopardized, it may experience impairment losses, and many of the other risks described in this Form 10-K, including, but not limited to, risks of increased indebtedness.

 General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Company s business by reducing both revenues generated from existing IMAX Systems and the demand for new IMAX Systems. 
 The Company s success depends in part on general political, social and economic conditions and the willingness of consumers to purchase tickets to IMAX movies. If movie-going becomes less popular globally, the Company s business could be adversely affected, especially if such a decline occurs in Greater China. In addition, the Company s operations could be adversely affected if consumers' discretionary income globally or in a particular geography falls as a result of an economic downturn or recession resulting from geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions, sustained increase in inflation and interest rates, supply chain issues, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Such adverse impact on consumer s discretionary income could result in a shift in consumer demand away from movie-going. The majority of the Company s revenue is directly derived from the box office results of its exhibitor partners. Accordingly, a decline in attendance at commercial IMAX locations could materially and adversely affect several sources of key revenue streams for the Company. 
 The Company also depends on the sale and lease of IMAX Systems to commercial movie exhibitors to generate revenue. Commercial movie exhibitors generate revenues from consumer attendance at their theaters, which depends on the willingness of consumers to visit movie theaters and spend discretionary income at movie theaters. In the event of declining box office and concession revenues, commercial exhibitors may be less willing to invest capital in new IMAX Systems. In addition, a significant portion of systems in the Company s backlog are expected to be installed in newly built multiplexes. An economic downturn, recession, significant increases in interest rates or other adverse economic developments could impact developers ability to secure financing on acceptable terms and complete the buildout of these locations, thereby negatively impacting the Company s ability to grow its theater network. 
 Finally, sustained inflationary pressures observed globally, as well as supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could materially increase the cost of our goods, services and personnel, which could cause an increase in our operating costs. 
 The success of the IMAX network is directly related to the availability and success of IMAX DMR films, and other films released to the IMAX network, as well as the continued purchase or lease of IMAX Systems and other support by movie exhibitors, for which there can be no guarantee. 
 An important factor affecting the growth and success of the IMAX network is the availability and strategic selection of films for IMAX locations and the box office performance of such films. The Company itself produces only a small number of such films and, as a result, the Company relies principally on films produced by third-party filmmakers and studios, including both Hollywood and local language features converted into the Company s format. In 2022, 63 new IMAX films were released to the Company s global network. There is no guarantee that filmmakers and studios will continue to release films to the IMAX network, or that the films selected for release to the IMAX network will be commercially successful. The Company is directly impacted by the commercial success and box office results of the films released to the IMAX network through its joint revenue sharing arrangements, as well as through the percentage of the box office receipts the Company receives from the studios releasing IMAX films, and the Company s continued ability to secure films, find suitable partners for joint revenue sharing arrangements and to sell IMAX Systems. The commercial success of films released to IMAX locations depends on a number of factors outside of the Company s control, including whether the film receives critical and consumer acclaim, the timing of its release, the success of the marketing efforts of the studio releasing the film, consumer preferences and trends in cinema attendance. Moreover, films can be subject to delays in production or changes in release schedule, which can negatively impact the number, timing and quality of IMAX films released to the Company s global network. 
 In addition, as the Company s international network has expanded, the Company has signed deals with studios in other countries to convert their films to the Company s format and release them to the IMAX network. The Company may be unable to select films which will be successful in international markets or may be unsuccessful in selecting the right mix of Hollywood and local language films for a particular country or region, notably Greater China, the Company s largest market. Also, conflicts in international release schedules may make it difficult to release every IMAX film in certain markets. 
 The Company depends principally on commercial movie exhibitors to purchase or lease IMAX Systems, to supply box office revenue under joint revenue sharing arrangements and under its sale and sales-type lease agreements and to supply venues in which to exhibit IMAX films. The Company can make no assurances that exhibitors will continue to do any of these things. 
 The Company is unable to predict the pace at which exhibitors will purchase or lease IMAX Systems or enter into joint revenue sharing arrangements with the Company, or whether any of the Company s existing exhibitor customers will continue to do any of the foregoing. If exhibitors choose to reduce their levels of expansion, negotiate economic terms that are less favorable to the Company, or decide not to enter into transactions with the Company, the Company s revenues would not increase at an anticipated rate and motion picture studios may be less willing to convert their films into the Company s format for exhibition in commercial IMAX locations. As a result, the Company s future revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected.

 The Company is undertaking brand extensions and new business initiatives, and the Company s investments and efforts in such business evolution may not be successful. 
 The Company is undertaking brand extensions and new business initiatives. These initiatives represent potential new areas of growth for the Company and could include the offering of new products and services that may not be accepted by the market. The Company has recently explored initiatives in the field of in-home entertainment technology, which is an intensely competitive business and which is dependent on consumer demand, over which the Company has no control. The Company is also exploring new technologies to connect the IMAX network to facilitate bringing more unique content, including broadcasts of live events, to IMAX audiences. If any new brand extensions and business initiatives in which the Company invests or attempts to develop does not progress as planned, the Company may be adversely affected by investment expenses that have not led to the anticipated results, by write-downs of its assets, by the distraction of management from its core business or by damage to its brand or reputation. 
 
 New initiatives could involve acquisitions or the formation of joint ventures and business alliances. In September 2022, the Company acquired SSIMWAVE for 19.5 million in cash and 160,547 common shares of the Company with a fair value of 1.9 million with additional earnout consideration. Such transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they may not advance the Company's long-term business strategy, that the Company realizes an unsatisfactory return on its investments or fails to realize anticipated business synergies, that the Company has difficulty integrating or retaining new employees, systems, and technology, that the Company has disagreements with a relevant partner with respect to financing, management, and development, that the Company fails to identify or anticipate risks and liabilities of acquired companies in advance of acquisition, or that management gets distracted from the Company's core business. Also, it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than the Company expected. 
 The Company faces cyber-security and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure, theft, or loss of confidential or other proprietary information, including intellectual property, damage to the Company s brand and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses. The Company must also comply with a variety of data privacy regulations and failure to comply with such regulations may affect the Company s financial performance. 
 The nature of the Company s business involves access to and storage of confidential and proprietary content and other information, including its own intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain movie studios or partners it may work with, as well as certain information regarding the Company s customers, employees, licensees, and suppliers. Although the Company maintains robust procedures, internal policies and technological security measures to safeguard such content and information, as well as a cyber-security insurance policy, the Company s information technology systems, and the information technology systems of our current or future third-party vendors, collaborators, consultants and service providers, could be penetrated by internal or external parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, stealing intellectual property or trade secrets, or disrupting business processes. Information security risks have increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. The Company s information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks, including through the use of malware, software bugs, computer viruses, ransomware, social engineering, and denial of service. It is possible that such attacks could compromise the Company s security measures or the security measures of parties with whom the Company does business. Because the techniques that may be used to circumvent the Company s safeguards change frequently and may be difficult to detect, the Company may be unable to anticipate any new techniques or implement sufficient preventive security measures. The Company seeks to monitor such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence through modifications to the Company s internal procedures and information technology infrastructure and provides information security training and compliance program to its employees on an annual basis, but in some cases preventive action might not be successful. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these security measures may be costly and will require ongoing updates as technologies evolve and techniques to overcome the Company s security measures become more sophisticated. Any such attack or unauthorized access could result in a disruption of the Company s operations, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of confidential or proprietary information of the Company or its customers, employees, licensees or suppliers, a reduction of the revenues the Company is able to generate from its operations, damage to the Company s brand and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of the Company s business and products, and significant legal and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 In addition, a variety of laws and regulations at the international, national, and state level govern the Company s collection, use, protection and processing of personal data. These laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, are constantly evolving and may result in increasing regulatory oversight and public scrutiny in the future. The Company s actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in fines, investigations, enforcement actions, penalties, sanctions, claims for damages by affected individuals, and damage to the Company s reputation, among other negative consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial performance.

 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 
 The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales, and future growth prospects. 
 A significant portion of the GBO generated by the Company s exhibitor customers and its revenues are generated by customers located outside the United States and Canada. Approximately 62 , 70 , and 77 of the Company s revenues were derived outside of the United States and Canada in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 75 of IMAX Systems in backlog are scheduled to be installed in international markets. The Company s network spanned 87 different countries as of December 31, 2022, and the Company expects its international operations to continue to account for an increasingly significant portion of its future revenues. There are a number of risks associated with operating in international markets that could negatively affect the Company s operations, sales and future growth prospects. These risks include: 
 new restrictions on access to markets, both for IMAX Systems and films; 

unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements, including censorship of content that may restrict what films the Company s network can present; 

fluctuations in the value of various foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar and potential currency devaluations; 

new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, sanctions, and other trade barriers; 

difficulties in obtaining competitively priced key commodities, raw materials, and component parts from various international sources that are needed to manufacture quality products on a timely basis; 

imposition of foreign exchange controls in foreign jurisdictions; 

dependence on foreign distributors and their sales channels; 

reliance on local partners, including in connection with joint revenue sharing arrangements; 

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 

inability to complete installations of IMAX Systems, including as a result of material disruptions or delays in the Company s supply chains, or collect full payment on installations thereof; 

local business practices that can present challenges to compliance with applicable anti-corruption and bribery laws; 

difficulties in establishing market-appropriate pricing; 

less accurate and/or less reliable box office reporting; 

adverse changes in foreign government monetary and/or tax policies, and/or difficulties in repatriating cash from foreign jurisdictions (including with respect to China, where approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange is required); 

poor recognition of intellectual property rights; 

difficulties in enforcing contractual rights; 

inflation; 

23 
 
 requirements to provide performance bonds and letters of credit to international customers to secure system component deliveries; 

harm to the IMAX brand from operating in countries with records of controversial government action, including human rights abuses; and 

political, economic and social instability, which could result in adverse consequences for the Company s interests in different regions of the world. 

Additionally, global geopolitical tensions and actions that governments take in response may adversely impact the Company. In response to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Canada, the United States, and other countries in which the Company operates have imposed broad sanctions and other restrictive actions against governmental and other entities in Russia and Belarus, which in turn have and may continue to have an adverse impact on the Company's business and results of operations in affected regions. In addition, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions, major movie studios suspended the theatrical release of films in Russia and Belarus and financial institutions halted transactions with Russian entities. The Company has notified its exhibitor clients in Russia and Belarus that such sanctions and actions constitute a force majeure event under their system agreements, resulting in the suspension of the Company's obligations thereunder. The scope, intensity, duration and outcome of the conflict is uncertain. Additionally, given the global nature of the Company's operations, any protracted conflict or the broader macroeconomic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and sanctions imposed on Russia, Belarus and other countries could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and future performance (the Company has 22 systems in its backlog from Russia, the CIS and Ukraine) and may also magnify the impact of other risks described herein, including the risk of cybersecurity attacks, which have increased in connection with the ongoing conflict and may impact information technology systems unrelated to the conflict, or jeopardize critical infrastructure in jurisdictions where the Company operates. 
 In addition, changes in United States or Canadian foreign policy can present additional risks or uncertainties as the Company continues to expand its international operations. Opening and operating theaters in markets that have experienced geopolitical or sociopolitical unrest or controversy, including through partnerships with local entities, exposes the Company to the risks listed above, as well as additional risks of operating in a volatile region. Such risks may negatively impact the Company s business operations in such regions and may also harm the Company s brand. Moreover, a deterioration of the diplomatic relations between the United States or Canada and a given country may impede the Company s ability to operate theaters in such countries and have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition and future growth prospects. 
 The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there. 
 Greater China is the Company s largest market by revenue, with approximately 24 of overall revenues generated from its Greater China operations in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 794 IMAX Systems operating in Greater China with an additional 204 systems in backlog, which represent 45 of the Company s current backlog. Of the IMAX Systems currently scheduled to be installed in Greater China, 66 are under joint revenue sharing arrangements, which further increases the Company s ongoing exposure to box office performance in this market. 
 The China market faces a number of risks, including changes in laws and regulations, currency fluctuations, increased competition, and changes in economic conditions, including the risk of an economic downturn or recession, trade embargoes, restrictions or other barriers, as well as other conditions that may impact the Company s exhibitor and studio partners, and consumer spending. The worsening of U.S. China political tensions could exacerbate any or all of these risks, and adverse developments in any of these areas could impact the Company s future revenues and cash flows and could cause the Company to fail to achieve anticipated growth. 
 The Company does not believe that it is currently required to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Cyberspace Administration of China or any other regulatory authority in the People s Republic of China PRC for its operations, but there can be no assurance that such permissions or approvals would not be required in the future and, if required, that they would be granted in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Furthermore, PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security, have been increasingly focused on regulation in data security and data protection. Regulatory requirements concerning data protection and cybersecurity in the PRC, as well as other requirements concerning operations of foreign businesses in the PRC, are evolving, and their enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation involve significant uncertainties. To the extent any PRC laws and regulations become applicable to the Company, it may be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the legal system in the PRC, including with respect to the enforcement of laws and the possibility of changes of rules and regulations with little or no advance notice. 
 24 
 
 Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates both the scope of the Company s continued expansion in China and the business conducted by it within China. For instance, the Chinese government regulates the number, timing, and terms of Hollywood films released to the China market. A number of prominent Hollywood films were denied release dates in China in 2021 and 2022, including several films released in IMAX format in other markets. The Company cannot provide assurance that the Chinese government will continue to permit the release of Hollywood IMAX films in China or that the timing or number of IMAX releases will be favorable to the Company. There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China. If the Company were unable to navigate China s regulatory environment, or if the Company were unable to enforce its intellectual property or contract rights in China, the Company s business could be adversely impacted. 
 The Company may experience adverse effects due to exchange rate fluctuations. 
 A substantial portion of the Company s revenues are denominated in U.S. Dollars, while a substantial portion of its expenses are denominated in Canadian Dollars. The Company also generates revenues in Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Euros and Japanese Yen. While the Company periodically enters into forward contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. and the Canadian Dollar, the Company may not be successful in reducing its exposure to these fluctuations. The use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. Even in jurisdictions in which the Company does not accept local currency or requires minimum payments in U.S. Dollars, significant local currency issues may impact the profitability of the Company s arrangements with its customers, which ultimately affect the ability to negotiate cost-effective arrangements and, therefore, the Company s results of operations. In addition, because IMAX films generate box office revenue in 87 different countries, unfavorable exchange rates between applicable local currencies and the U.S. Dollar could affect the GBO generated by exhibitors and the Company s reported revenues, further impacting the Company s results of operations. 
 RISK RELATED TO THE COMPANY S INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT 
 Consolidation among commercial exhibitors and studios reduces the breadth of the Company s customer base, and could result in a narrower market for the Company s products and reduced negotiating leverage. A deterioration in the Company s relationship with key partners could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or results of operation. In addition, an adverse economic impact on a significant customer s business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Company. 
 The Company s primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors. Since 2016, the commercial exhibition industry has undergone significant consolidation, including AMC s acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and Odeon, which includes Nordic and Cineworld's acquisition of Regal. Exhibitor concentration has resulted in certain exhibitor chains constituting a material portion of the Company s network and revenue. For instance, although Wanda sold its controlling interest in AMC in 2021, it continues to be the Company s largest exhibitor customer, representing approximately 7 of the Company s total revenues in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, through the Company s partnership with Wanda, there were 375 IMAX Systems operational in Greater China and Wanda represented approximately 22 of the commercial network and 4 of the Company s backlog. The share of the Company s revenue that is generated by Wanda is expected to continue to grow as the number of Wanda theater systems currently in backlog are opened. No assurance can be given that significant customers such as Wanda will continue to purchase IMAX Systems and/or enter into joint revenue sharing arrangements with the Company and if so, whether contractual terms will be affected. If the Company does business with Wanda or other large exhibitor chains less frequently or on less favorable terms than currently, the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, an adverse economic impact on a significant customer s business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Company. 
 The Company also receives revenues from studios releasing IMAX films. Hollywood studios have also experienced consolidation, as evidenced by the Walt Disney Company s acquisition of certain studio assets from Twenty First Century Fox in 2019. Studio consolidation could result in individual studios comprising a greater percentage of the Company s film slate and overall IMAX DMR revenue, and could expose the Company to the same risks described above in connection with exhibitor consolidation. 
 25 
 
 Failure to respond adequately or in a timely fashion to changes and advancements in digital technology could negatively affect the Company s business. 
 In order to keep pace with changes and advancements in digital technology and in order to continue to provide an experience that is premium to and differentiated from conventional cinema experiences, the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, significant investments in digital technology in the form of research and development and the acquisition of third-party intellectual property and/or proprietary technology. A significant portion of the Company s recent research and development efforts have been focused on its laser-based projection systems, which began rolling out to the largest theaters in the IMAX network at the end of 2014. Since then, the Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. Furthermore, in September 2022, the Company acquired SSIMWAVE, a leader in AI-driven video quality solutions for media and entertainment companies. With the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, the Company s conducting research and development in perceptual metrics including novel measurement and optimization techniques. The process of developing new technologies is inherently uncertain and subject to certain factors that are outside of the Company s control, including reliance on third-party partners and suppliers, and the Company can provide no assurance its investments will result in commercially viable advancements to the Company s existing products or in commercially successful new products, or that any such advancements or products will improve upon existing technology or will be developed within the timeframe expected. 
 The introduction of new, competing products and technologies could harm the Company s business. 
 The out-of-home entertainment industry is very competitive, and the Company faces a number of competitive challenges. The Company faces competition both in the form of technological advances in in-home entertainment, as well as those within the theater-going experience. For example, according to research conducted by Omdia, there were approximately 43,000 conventional-sized screens in North American commercial multiplexes in 2022. In addition, exhibitors and entertainment technology companies have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums or other proprietary theater systems, and in many cases have marketed those auditoriums or theater systems as having similar quality or attributes as an IMAX System. The Company may continue to face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. If the Company is unable to continue to deliver a premium movie-going experience, or if other technologies surpass those of the Company, the Company may be unable to continue to produce theater systems which are premium to, or differentiated from, other theater systems. Furthermore, many of the Company's commercial exhibitor customers are reliant on the availability of retail shopping malls at physical locations, which compete with other forms of retailing such as online retail websites, and may be adversely affected by the changes in the retail shopping landscape and consumer purchasing pattern. In return, the Company may be adversely affected by the challenges faced by its exhibitor customers. 
 As noted above, the Company faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, streaming services, video-on-demand, internet, and broadcast and cable television. The average exclusive theatrical release window for Hollywood titles has decreased over the years and there can be no assurance that this release window, which is determined by the movie studios, will not shrink further, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related movie theater closures, in 2020 and 2021, a number of films were released directly or concurrently to streaming services the same day as to theaters. Most major film studios have since recommitted to exclusive theatrical releases for blockbuster movies. However, there can be no assurance that direct or concurrent release to streaming services will not resume or increase in the future, intensifying in-home competition. The Company further competes for the public s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media, and restaurants. 
 If the Company is unable to continue to produce a differentiated theater experience, consumers may be unwilling to pay the price premiums associated with the cost of IMAX tickets and box office performance of IMAX films may decline. The declining box-office performance of IMAX films could materially and adversely harm the Company s business and prospects. 
 26 
 
 The Company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property, and competitors could misappropriate its technology or brand, which could weaken its competitive position. 
 The Company depends on its proprietary knowledge regarding IMAX Systems and digital and film technology, video quality assessment and image enhancement. The Company relies principally upon a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary and intellectual property rights. These laws and procedures may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized parties from attempting to copy or otherwise obtain the Company s processes and technology or deter others from developing similar processes or technology, which could weaken the Company s competitive position and require the Company to incur costs to secure enforcement of its intellectual property rights. The protection provided to the Company s proprietary technology by the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect it as fully as the laws of Canada or the United States. The lack of protection afforded to intellectual property rights in certain international jurisdictions may be increasingly problematic given the extent to which the future growth of the Company is anticipated to come from foreign jurisdictions. Finally, some of the underlying technologies of the Company s products and system components are not covered by patents or patent applications. 
 The Company owns patents issued and patent applications pending, including those covering its digital projector, digital conversion technology, laser illumination technology, and other inventions relating to imaging technology and video quality assessment. The Company s patents are filed in the United States, often with corresponding patents or filed applications in other jurisdictions, such as Canada, China, Belgium, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The patent applications pending may not be issued or the patents may not provide the Company with any competitive advantage. The patent applications may also be challenged by third parties. Several of the Company s issued patents for improvements to IMAX projection system components expire between 2023 and 2038. If the Company s patent claims are rendered invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded the Company s products and services could be impaired, which could negatively affect its competitive position. In addition, competitors and other third parties may be able to circumvent or design around the Company s patents and may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies. If these developments were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on the Company s sales or market position. 
 Any claims or litigation initiated by the Company to protect its proprietary technology could be time consuming, costly, and divert the attention of its technical and management resources. If the Company chooses to go to court to stop a third party from infringing its intellectual property, that third party may ask the court to rule that the Company s intellectual property rights are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. 
 The Company relies upon trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary know how to develop and maintain the Company s competitive position. While it is the Company s policy to enter into agreements imposing nondisclosure and confidentiality obligations upon its employees and third parties to protect the Company s intellectual property, these obligations may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for the Company s trade secrets or proprietary know how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of the Company s trade secrets and know how. Furthermore, despite the existence of such nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, or other contractual restrictions, the Company may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of its confidential proprietary information or trade secrets by consultants, vendors and employees. In addition, others could obtain knowledge of the Company s trade secrets through independent development or other legal means. 
 The IMAX brand stands for the highest quality and most immersive entertainment experiences. Protecting the IMAX brand is a critical element in maintaining the Company s relationships with studios and its exhibitor clients and building and maintaining brand loyalty and recognition. Though the Company relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law as well as its contractual provisions to protect the IMAX brand, those protections may not be adequate to prevent erosion of the brand over time, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. Erosion of the brand could threaten the demand for the Company s products and services and impair its ability to grow future revenue streams. In addition, if any of the Company s registered or unregistered trademarks, trade names or service marks is challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks, it could have an adverse effect on the Company s sales or market position. 
 
 27 
 
 The Company may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights that are costly to defend, result in the diversion of management s time and efforts, require the payment of damages, limit the Company s ability to use particular technologies in the future or prevent the Company from marketing its existing or future products and services. 
 The Company s commercial success will depend in part on not infringing, misappropriating, or violating the intellectual property rights of others. A third party could assert a claim against the Company for alleged infringement of its patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, including in relation to technologies that are important to the Company s business. The Company may not be aware of whether its products or services do or will infringe existing or future patents or the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there can be no assurance that one or more of The Company s competitors who have developed competing technologies or the Company s other competitors will not be granted patents for their technology and allege that the Company has infringed. 
 Any claims that the Company s business infringes the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could entail significant costs in responding to, defending, and resolving such claims. An adverse determination in any intellectual property claim could require the Company to pay damages and/or stop using its technologies, trademarks, copyrighted works, and other material found to be in violation of another party s rights and could prevent the Company from licensing its technologies to others unless we enter into royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party or are able to redesign our products and services to avoid infringement. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to redesign its services in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any payments the Company is required to make and any injunction the Company is required to comply with as a result of any infringement could harm its reputation and financial results. 
 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY S REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND FINANCIAL POSITION 
 The Company s operating results and cash flow can vary substantially from period to period and could increase the volatility of its share price. 
 The Company s operating results and cash flow can fluctuate substantially from period to period. In particular, fluctuations in IMAX System installations and GBO performance of IMAX films can materially affect operating results. Factors that have affected the Company s operating results and cash flow in the past, and are likely to affect its operating results and cash flow in the future, include, among other things: 
 the timing of signing and installation of new IMAX Systems (particularly for installations in newly-built multiplexes, which can result in delays that are beyond the Company s control); 

the timing and commercial success of films distributed to the Company s network; 

the demand for, and acceptance of, the Company s products and services; 

the recognition of revenue of sale and sales-type leases; 

the classification of leases as sales-type versus operating; 

the volume of orders received and that can be filled in the quarter; 

the level of its sales backlog; 

the signing of film distribution agreements; 

the financial performance of IMAX Systems operated by the Company s customers; 

financial difficulties faced by customers, particularly customers in the commercial exhibition industry; 

the magnitude and timing of spending in relation to the Company s research and development efforts and related investments, as well as new business initiatives; and 

the number and timing of joint revenue sharing arrangement installations, related capital expenditures, and timing of related cash receipts. 

28 
 
 Most of the Company s operating expenses are fixed in the short term. The Company may be unable to rapidly adjust its spending to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales, joint revenue sharing arrangements revenue or IMAX DMR revenue, which would harm operating results for a particular period. 
 The Company s systems revenue can vary significantly from its cash flows under IMAX System sales or lease agreements. 
 The Company s systems revenue can vary significantly from the associated cash flows. The Company often provides financing to customers for IMAX Systems on a long-term basis through long-term sale or lease arrangements. The terms of leases or financing receivables are typically 10 to 12 years. The sale and sales-type lease agreements for IMAX Systems typically provide for three major sources of cash flow: 
 initial fees, which are paid in installments generally commencing upon the signing of the agreement until installation of the IMAX System; 

ongoing fees, which are paid monthly after the IMAX System has been opened to the public and are generally equal to the greater of a fixed minimum amount per annum and a percentage of box office receipts; and 

ongoing annual maintenance and extended warranty fees, which are generally payable commencing in the second year of theater operations. 

Initial fees generally make up the vast majority of cash received under IMAX System sales or sales-type lease agreements for a theater arrangement. 
 For sale and sales-type leases, the revenue recorded is generally equal to the sum of initial fees and the present value of any future initial payments, and fixed minimum ongoing payments. Sales arrangements also include an estimate of future variable consideration due under the agreement. Cash received from initial fees in advance of meeting the revenue recognition criteria for the IMAX Systems is recorded as deferred revenue. 
 Leases that do not transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are classified as operating leases. For these leases, initial fees and fixed minimum ongoing payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent payments in excess of fixed minimum ongoing payments are recognized as revenue when reported by theater operators, provided collectability is reasonably assured. 
 As a result of the above, the revenue set forth in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements does not necessarily correlate with the Company s cash flow or cash position. Revenues include the present value of future contracted cash payments and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive such payments under its lease and sale agreements if its customers default on their payment obligations. 
 The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company s backlog included 450 IMAX Systems, consisting of 162 IMAX Systems under sales or lease arrangements and 288 IMAX Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements. The Company lists signed contracts for IMAX Systems for which revenue has not been recognized as backlog prior to the time of revenue recognition. The total value of the backlog represents all signed IMAX System sale or lease agreements that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the future and includes initial fees along with the estimated present value of contractual ongoing fees due over the term, and a variable consideration estimate for the IMAX Systems under sales arrangements, but it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. Notwithstanding the legal obligation to do so, some of the Company s customers with which it has signed contracts may not accept delivery of IMAX Systems that are included in the Company s backlog. An economic downturn may exacerbate the risk of customers not accepting delivery of IMAX Systems. Any reduction in backlog could adversely affect the Company s future revenues and cash flows. In addition, customers with theater system obligations in backlog sometimes request that the Company agree to modify or reduce such obligations, which the Company has agreed to do in the past under certain circumstances. Customer-requested delays in the installation of IMAX Systems in backlog remain a recurring and unpredictable part of the Company s business. 
 
 29 
 
 The Company s inability to enter into renewals of new sales and lease agreements on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect its cash flows and operating results. 
 Approximately 11 of the Company s sales and lease agreements are due to expire in the next 12 months. If these agreements are not renewed, or if the Company is unable to enter into new leases agreements comparable to those currently in effect in a timely manner, then the Company s theater revenue could be adversely affected. Although the Company has not been informed by any client of its intention not to renew an expiring sales or lease agreement, there can be no assurance that the expiring sales and lease agreements will be renewed or new agreements will be entered into on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all. 
 The Company s revenues from existing customers are derived in part from financial reporting provided by its customers, which may be inaccurate or incomplete, resulting in lost or delayed revenues. 
 The Company s revenue under its joint revenue sharing arrangements, a portion of the Company s payments under lease or sales arrangements and its film distribution fees are based upon financial reporting provided by its customers. If such reporting is inaccurate, incomplete, or withheld, the Company s ability to receive the appropriate payments it is owed in a timely fashion may be impaired. The Company s contractual ability to audit IMAX locations may not rectify payments lost or delayed as a result of customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations with respect to financial reporting. 
 There is collection risk associated with payments to be received over the terms of the Company s IMAX System agreements. 
 The Company is dependent in part on the viability of its exhibitors for collections under long-term leases, sales financing agreements, and joint revenue sharing arrangements. Exhibitors or other operators may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their contractual payment obligations to the Company. As a result, the Company s future revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 The Company may be subject to impairment losses on its film assets if such assets do not meet management s estimates of total revenues. 
 The Company amortizes its film assets, including IMAX DMR costs capitalized using the individual film forecast method, whereby the costs of film assets are amortized and participation costs are accrued for each film in the ratio of revenues earned in the current period to management s estimate of total revenues ultimately expected to be received for that title. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its estimates of ultimate revenues on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of the film assets and write-downs or impairments of film assets. Results of operations in future years will include the amortization of the Company s film assets and may be significantly affected by periodic adjustments in amortization rates. 
 The Company may be subject to impairment losses on its inventories if they become obsolete. 
 The Company records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory based upon current estimates of future events and conditions, including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts, technological developments, signings in negotiation and anticipated market acceptance of the Company s current and pending IMAX Systems. 
 If the Company s goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, the Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 
 Under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ), the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be qualitatively assessed at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances arise or can be quantitatively tested for impairment. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances include (but are not limited to) a decline in stock price and market capitalization, declines in future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the Company s industry. The Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or long-lived assets is determined. 
 30 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY S COMMON SHARES 
 The market price for the Company s common shares has historically been volatile and declines in market price, including as a result of a market downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may negatively affect its ability to raise capital, issue debt, secure customer business, and retain employees. 
 The Company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and its publicly traded shares have in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility could reduce the market price of its common shares, regardless of the Company s operating performance. A decline in the capital markets generally, or an adjustment in the market price or trading volumes of the Company s publicly traded securities, may negatively affect its ability to raise capital, issue debt, secure customer business or retain employees. These factors, as well as general economic and geopolitical conditions, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company s publicly traded securities. 
 Because the Company is incorporated in Canada, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to enforce against the Company liabilities based solely upon United States federal securities laws. 
 The Company is incorporated under the federal laws of Canada, some of its directors and officers are residents of Canada and a substantial portion of its assets and the assets of such directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for United States plaintiffs to effect service within the United States upon those directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to obtain or enforce against them or the Company judgments of United States courts predicated solely upon civil liability under the United States federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to bring an original action outside of the United States against the Company to enforce liabilities based solely on United States federal securities laws. 
 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY S INDEBTEDNESS 
 The credit agreement governing the Company s senior secured credit facility contains significant restrictions that limit its operating and financial flexibility. 
 The credit agreement governing the Company s senior secured credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to: 
 incur additional indebtedness; 

pay dividends and make distributions; 

repurchase stock; 

make certain investments; 

transfer or sell assets; 

create liens; 

enter into transactions with affiliates; 

issue or sell stock of subsidiaries; 

create dividend or other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries; and 

merge, consolidate, amalgamate, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to another person. 

These restrictive covenants impose operating and financial restrictions on the Company that limit its ability to engage in acts that may be in the Company s long-term best interests. 
 31 
 
 The Company s indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for its operations, expose the Company to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had approximately 413.2 million of consolidated indebtedness and liabilities. The Company may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. The Company s indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for its security holders and its business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: 
 increasing its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

limiting its ability to obtain additional financing; 

requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; 

limiting its flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business; 

diluting the interests of its shareholders as a result of issuing common shares upon conversion of the 0.500 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Convertible Notes ); and 

placing the Company at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than the Company or have better access to capital. 

The Company s business may not generate sufficient funds, and the Company may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under its indebtedness, and the Company s cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness that the Company incurs may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit its ability to operate, raise capital or make payments under its other indebtedness. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or to make payments under its indebtedness when due, then the Company would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and the Company s other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. For a description of the Company outstanding indebtedness, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. 
 The Company may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and the Company s other indebtedness may limit its ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. 
 Noteholders may, subject to a limited exception described in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of Convertible Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. The Company may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time it is required to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing the Company s other indebtedness may restrict the Company s ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. The Company s failure to repurchase Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing the Company s other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. The Company may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under its other indebtedness and the Convertible Notes. 
 Provisions in the indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of the Company. 
 Certain provisions in the Convertible Notes and the related indenture could make a third-party attempt to acquire the Company more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then the Company may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes. In either case, and in other cases, the Company s obligations under the Convertible Notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring the Company otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring the Company or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of the Company s common shares may view as favorable. 
 32 
 
 The Company is subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Call Transactions, and the capped call may not operate as planned. 
 In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties (the Capped Call Transactions ). The Capped Call Transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution resulting from the common shares the Company is required to issue and/or to offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common shares is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of the Company s common shares underlying the Convertible Notes. 
 
 The option counterparties are financial institutions, and the Company will be subject to the risk that they might default under the Capped Call Transactions. The Company s exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, the Company will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to the Company s exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. The Company s exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, the increase in the Company s exposure will be correlated with increases in the market price or the volatility of its common shares. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, the Company may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than the Company currently anticipates with respect to its common shares. The Company can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty. In addition, the Capped Call Transactions are complex, and they may not operate as planned. For example, the terms of the Capped Call Transactions may be subject to adjustment, modification or, in some cases, renegotiation if certain corporate or other transactions occur. Accordingly, these transactions may not operate as the Company intends if it is required to adjust their terms as a result of transactions in the future or upon unanticipated developments that may adversely affect the functioning of the Capped Call Transactions. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 The loss of one or more of the Company s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain its employee population, could adversely affect its business. 
 The Company s operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance and continued service of its senior management team. The competition for experienced senior management in the Company s industry is intense, and the Company may not find qualified replacements for any of these individuals if their services are no longer available on the same terms or at all. The loss of the services of one or more members of the Company s senior management team could adversely affect its ability to effectively pursue its business strategy. 
 In addition, the Company may experience challenges with respect to employee retention given the current competitive labor market. A number of external factors beyond the Company s control, including its industry s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, and workforce participation rates, may negatively affect the Company s ability to retain and attract qualified employees. If the Company experiences high attrition rates in its employee population, the results of our operations may be adversely affected. 
 Changes in accounting and changes in management s estimates may affect the Company s reported earnings and operating income. 
 U.S. GAAP and accompanying accounting pronouncements are highly complex and involve many subjective judgments. Changes in these rules, their interpretation, management s estimates, or changes in the Company s products or business could significantly change its reported future earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. (See Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7.) 
 
 33 
 
 Regulatory and market responses to climate change concerns may negatively impact our business and increase our operating costs. 
 Growing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on climate change issues. As a result, climate change regulation and market reactions to climate change could adversely impact the Company s business, including the potential for an increase in climate risk assessment. Such enhanced governmental and societal attention to climate matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change impacts, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that the Company is required to control, assess, and report. Furthermore, regulatory efforts to combat climate change could result in increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for the Company s suppliers and vendors which would result in higher operating costs for the Company and potentially impact the availability of components used in the Company s systems. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations, and expectations may increase the cost of the Company s compliance, divert management attention, alter the environment in which it does business, and expose the Company to potentially significant fines or other penalties if it is unable to comply with such laws, regulations or policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the shift toward a lower-carbon economy, driven by policy regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, consumer sentiment, and/or liability risks, may negatively impact the Company s business and operating costs. However, the Company is unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any climate change initiatives may have on its business. 
 The Company s business and financial results could be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters. 
 Physical risks, including man-made disasters, such as infrastructure failures, structural collapse, fires, explosions, and acts of war and terror, as well as weather conditions and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, hailstorms, heavy or prolonged precipitation, wildfires, hurricanes, sea level rise and others, affecting the IMAX global network or corporate locations, could harm the Company s business. Additionally, the physical impacts of climate change may cause occurrences of natural disasters to increase in frequency, severity and duration, magnifying the adverse impact of such occurrences and the cost of insuring against them. The climates and geology of some of the regions in which the Company s principal offices are located, including California, present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters. Any such events in the future could disrupt the Company s operations and impact the Company s ability to serve its customers.

 PART II 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stoc kholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The Company s common shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol IMAX . 
 As of January 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 253 registered holders of record of its common shares. 
 Over the last few years, the Company has not paid, nor does the Company have any current plans to pay, cash dividends on its common shares. The payment of dividends by the Company is subject to certain restrictions under the terms of the Company s indebtedness (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8). The payment of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including the Company s financial condition and requirements, future prospects, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. 
 The Company grants two types of performance stock units PSU ), one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets, and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets. The achievement of the EBITDA and TSR targets in these PSUs is determined over a three-year performance period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from 0 to a maximum vesting opportunity of 175 of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and stock-price targets.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 OVERVIEW 
 IMAX Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company , or IMAX is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation Predecessor IMAX ). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967. 
 IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property, and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end solution to create superior, immersive content experiences for which the IMAX brand is globally renowned. Top filmmakers, movie studios, artists, and creators utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways. As a result, IMAX is among the most important and successful global distribution platforms for domestic and international tentpole films and, increasingly, exclusive experiences ranging from live performances to interactive events with leading artists and creators. 
 The Company leverages its proprietary technology and engineering in all aspects of its business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other content into the IMAX format IMAX DMR and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems IMAX System(s) ). 
 IMAX Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company s history since its founding in 1967. The customers for IMAX Systems are principally theater exhibitors that operate commercial multiplex theaters, and, to a much lesser extent, museums, science centers and destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the locations in the IMAX network, and is not an exhibitor, but instead sells or leases the IMAX System to exhibitor customers along with a license to use its trademarks and ongoing maintenance services. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were 1,716 IMAX Systems operating in 87 countries and territories, including 1,633 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 71 institutional locations in the Company's global network. This compares to 1,683 IMAX Systems operating in 87 countries and territories as of December 31, 2021, including 1,599 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 72 institutional locations in the Company's global network. (See the table below under IMAX Network and Backlog for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.) 
 The IMAX System provides the Company s exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits: 
 the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences; 

advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems; 

large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer s peripheral vision and creates more realistic images; 

advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in a theater equipped with an IMAX System; 

specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; 

ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services, and 

a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand. 

In addition, certain movies shown in the IMAX network are filmed using proprietary IMAX film cameras or IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and an IMAX-exclusive film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26 more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX locations worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, with up to 67 more image. 
 39 
 
 Together, these components cause audiences in IMAX locations to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive, and exciting experience than a traditional theater. 
 As a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience , the Company's exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX films, generates incremental box office for the Company's exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood and foreign local language movie studios. 
 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative IMAX Live TM events and experiences to audiences worldwide. The Company has a footprint of connected IMAX Systems capable of delivering live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. As of December 31, 2022, 253 systems in the IMAX network across North America, Europe and Asia were configured with connectivity to deliver live and interactive events. 
 As a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. The Company offers a suite of IMAX Laser Systems, which deliver increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast, and the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that its suite of IMAX Laser Systems are helping facilitate the next major renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network. 
 In September 2022, the Company acquired SSIMWAVE Inc. SSIMWAVE ), a Canadian company, a leader in AI-driven video quality solutions for media and entertainment companies. The acquisition of SSIMWAVE marks a significant expansion of the Company's strategy to deliver the highest quality images on any screen to drive new, recurring revenue and grow its global leadership in entertainment technology. (See SSIMWAVE under Sources of Revenue - All Other and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information related to the Company's acquisition of SSIMWAVE.) 
 Commencing in March 2022, in response to numerous sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada and the European Union on companies transacting in Russia and Belarus resulting from ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Company suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus. As of December 31, 2022, the IMAX network includes 54 theaters in Russia, eight theaters in Ukraine, and one theater in Belarus, and the Company's backlog includes 14 theaters in Russia, one theater in Ukraine, and five theaters in Belarus with a total fixed contracted value of 22.9 million. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded provisions for potential credit losses against substantially all of its receivables in Russia due to uncertainties associated with the ongoing conflict. These receivables relate to existing sale agreements as the Company is not party to any joint revenue sharing arrangements in these countries. In addition, exhibitors in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus were placed on nonaccrual status for maintenance revenue and finance income beginning in the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in revenue deferred and not recognized of 2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Most multiplexes in Ukraine have reopened since the conflict began and the Company remains optimistic that its full network in Ukraine will ultimately resume operations. The Company continues to closely monitor the evolving impacts of this conflict (including the sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada and the European Union) and its effects on the global economy and the Company. (See Risk Factors - The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales, and future growth prospects. in Part I, Item 1A and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 On September 7, 2022, Cineworld Group plc Cineworld ), the parent company of Regal, and certain of its subsidiaries and Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC, filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. The Company had an unsecured pre-petition claim of 11.4 million related to receivables from the entities included in the reorganization proceedings. On October 21, 2022, the Company was ratified by the bankruptcy court as a critical vendor of Cineworld, allowing the Company to collect pre-petition amounts owed to it by Cineworld, and requiring Cineworld to stay current on the Company s post-petition receivables. On November 8, 2022, IMAX Corporation entered into a trade agreement with Cineworld (the Trade Agreement ), pursuant to which Cineworld affirmed the amount of the receivables owed to the Company and agreed to a payment plan under which all amounts due will be settled over the period from November 9, 2022 to April 12, 2023. As of February 20, 2023, the Company had received payments of 7.2 million from Cineworld in accordance with the terms of the Trade Agreement. Based on its evaluation of its contracts with Cineworld, its assessment of the reorganization and its discussions with Cineworld to date, the Company has determined that no additional provision for expected credit losses is required. The Company also does not expect to see a material impact on its IMAX network with Cineworld resulting from this reorganization. There can, however, be no guarantees as to the ultimate outcome of a Chapter 11 proceeding.

 IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to prevent its spread have impacted the Company s business and the global economy. Capacity restrictions and safety protocols were lifted then reinstituted at various points since the third quarter of 2020. Although normal operations have resumed in most key markets and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network, the Company s business continues to experience impact from COVID-19. For example, following the emergence of the Omicron variant and the rise of COVID-19 cases in China in the first quarter of 2022, the Chinese government reinstituted capacity restrictions and safety protocols on large public gatherings and enforced a dynamic zero-COVID policy, which led to the temporary lock-down of various cities and the temporary closure of theaters in these cities. At the end of 2022, the Chinese government relaxed its dynamic zero-COVID policies and significantly eased capacity restrictions. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 97 of the IMAX network in Greater China was open at various capacities. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, gross box office GBO generated by IMAX films totaled 849.7 million, representing a 211.5 million (33 increase versus 2021. Although GBO results during 2022 were impacted by the COVID-related theater closures in China, management remains encouraged by the overall positive trend in box office results and believes it indicates that moviegoers are returning to theaters, and in particular IMAX locations, where and when theaters are open, and they feel safe. Despite accounting for approximately 1 of all domestic screens and less than 1 of all screens globally, the IMAX network had a domestic market share of 5 and a global market share of 3 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management is further encouraged by the return of the prevalence of exclusive theatrical windows and the strong pipeline of Hollywood movies scheduled to be released for theatrical exhibition throughout the remainder of 2023. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be accurately predicted and that will vary by jurisdiction and market. 
 (See Risk Factors The Company experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods in Part I, Item 1A, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 SOURCES OF REVENUE 
 For the presentation of Management's Discussion Analysis, the Company has organized its reportable segments into the following three categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; and (iii) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these three categories are the Company s following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements JRSA ); (iii) IMAX Systems; (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) Film Distribution; and (vii) Film Post-Production. The Company's activities that do not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment are disclosed within All Other. 
 IMAX Technology Network 
 The IMAX Technology Network category earns revenue based on contingent box office receipts. Included in the IMAX Technology Network category are the IMAX DMR segment and contingent rent from the JRSA segment, which are each described in more detail below. 
 IMAX DMR 
 IMAX DMR is a proprietary technology that digitally remasters films into IMAX formats. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a movie studio in exchange for converting a commercial film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. The fee earned by the Company in a typical IMAX DMR arrangement averages approximately 12.5 of box office receipts (i.e., GBO less applicable sales taxes), except for within Greater China, where the Company receives a lower percentage of net box office receipts for certain Hollywood films. 
 IMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited across the IMAX network is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position. 
 41 
 
 IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as IMAX DNA . Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience's immersion in the film and to take advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26 more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX locations worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, with up to 67 more image. The Company has a Filmed For IMAX TM program under which filmmakers craft films from their inception in various ways in order to optimize The IMAX Experience and includes incremental and bespoke marketing support, which box office metrics demonstrate audiences respond extremely favorably to. 
 Management believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company is focused on the expansion of the IMAX network and has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing its slate of Hollywood films with appealing local language films released in select markets, including China, Japan, India, and South Korea. 
 The following table provides detailed information about the films that were released to the Company's global network during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 The Company concluded 2022 with the release of Avatar: The Way of Water on December 16, 2022 which became the Company's highest grossing release of 2022 by earning 140.2 million of GBO (or 11 market share) during the year ended December 31, 2022. This momentum has carried over into 2023 throughout the remainder of the film's theatrical run with its cumulative GBO of approximately 250 million, cementing the title as the highest global first run IMAX release of all time, and the top performing IMAX release of all time in 48 countries to date.

 Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements Contingent Rent 
 The JRSA segment provides IMAX Systems to exhibitors through joint revenue sharing arrangements. Under the traditional form of these arrangements, the Company provides the IMAX System under a long-term lease in which the Company assumes the majority of the equipment and installation costs. In exchange for its upfront investment, the Company earns rent based on a percentage of contingent box office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront fee or annual minimum payments. Rental payments from the customer are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are due either monthly or quarterly. The Company retains title to the IMAX System equipment components throughout the lease term, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement. 
 Under certain other joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a percentage of contingent box office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although this percentage is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, while the fixed upfront payment is recorded as revenue within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a sale, see the discussion below under IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance. 
 43 
 
 Under most joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term is 10 years or longer and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. 
 The revenue earned from customers under the Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements can vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors including film performance, the mix of theater system configurations, the timing of installation of IMAX Systems, the nature of the arrangement, the location, size and management of the theater and other factors specific to individual arrangements. 
 Joint revenue sharing arrangements also require IMAX to provide maintenance and extended warranty services to the customer over the term of the lease in exchange for a separate fixed annual fee. These fees are reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below. 
 Joint revenue sharing arrangements have been an important factor in the expansion of the Company s commercial theater network. Joint revenue sharing arrangements allow commercial theater exhibitors to install IMAX Systems without the significant initial capital investment required in a sale or sales-type lease arrangement. Joint revenue sharing arrangements drive recurring cash flows and earnings for the Company as customers under these arrangements pay the Company a portion of their ongoing box office receipts. The Company funds its investment in equipment for joint revenue sharing arrangements through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 931 locations in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements in its global commercial multiplex network, a 2 increase as compared to the 909 locations as of December 31, 2021. The Company also had contracts in backlog for 288 systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2022, including 76 upgrades to existing locations and 212 new locations. 
 IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance 
 The IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue principally from the sale or sales-type lease of IMAX Systems, as well as from the maintenance of IMAX Systems. To a lesser extent, the IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category also earns revenue from certain hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements and certain ancillary theater business activities. These activities are described in more detail below under the captioned section for each respective segment. 
 IMAX Systems 
 The IMAX Systems segment provides IMAX Systems to exhibitors through sale arrangements or long-term lease arrangements that for accounting purposes are classified as sales-type leases. Under these arrangements, in exchange for providing the IMAX System, the Company earns initial fees and ongoing consideration, which can include fixed annual minimum payments and contingent fees in excess of the minimum payments, as well as maintenance and extended warranty fees (see IMAX Maintenance below). The initial fees vary depending on the system configuration and location of the theater. Initial fees are paid to the Company in installments between the time of signing the arrangement and the time of system installation, which is when the total of these fees, in addition to the present value of future annual minimum payments, are recognized as revenue. Finance income is recognized over the term of a financed sale or sales-type lease arrangement. In addition, in sale arrangements, an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded is recorded as revenue in the period when the sale is recognized and is adjusted in future periods based on actual results and changes in estimates. Such variable consideration is only recognized on sales transactions to the extent the Company believes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal. 
 In sale arrangements, title to the IMAX System equipment generally transfers to the customer. However, in certain instances, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required by the agreement or until certain shipment events for the equipment have occurred. In a sales-type lease arrangement, title to the IMAX System equipment remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. 
 The revenue earned from customers under the Company's theater system sale or lease agreements varies from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors, including the number and mix of theater system configurations sold or leased, the timing of installation of the IMAX Systems, the nature of the arrangement and other factors specific to individual contracts. 
 44 
 
 Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements Fixed Fees 
 Under certain joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, as discussed above, while the fixed upfront payment is reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance. 
 IMAX Maintenance 
 IMAX System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee paid by the exhibitor. Under these arrangements, the Company provides preventative and emergency maintenance services to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the system agreements. 
 Other Theater Business 
 The Other Theater Business segment principally includes after-market sales of IMAX System parts and 3D glasses. 
 Film Distribution and Post-Production 
 Film Distribution 
 Through its Film Distribution segment, the Company distributes large-format documentary films, primarily to institutional theaters. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and, following the recoupment of its costs, is typically entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues. In March 2022, the Company released the IMAX documentary film entitled IMAX presents The Last Glaciers. 
 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative IMAX Live TM events and experiences to audiences worldwide. The Company has a footprint of connected IMAX Systems capable of delivering live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. As of December 31, 2022, 253 systems in the IMAX network across North America, Europe and Asia were configured with connectivity to deliver live and interactive events. 
 In 2022, the Company partnered with Disney for a live Q A with director and producer Peter Jackson, followed by a special screening of The Beatles: Get Back The Rooftop Concert , which was later released across the IMAX global network. Additionally, the Company presented Brandi Carlile: In The Canyon Haze - Live from Laurel Canyon , a one-night-only live concert performing her new deluxe album In The Canyon Haze for the very first time, in connected locations across the United States, among various other live events and special screenings presented throughout 2022. 
 The Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content. 
 Post-Production 
 Through its Post-Production segment, the Company provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films, whether produced by IMAX or third parties, and digital post-production services. 
 All Other

 SSIMWAVE 
 On September 22, 2022, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of SSIMWAVE pursuant to a share purchase agreement by and among the Company, SSIMWAVE, and related shareholders (the Sellers ). SSIMWAVE provides perceptual quality measurement and optimization solutions based on artificial intelligence technologies for leading media and entertainment companies. Following the acquisition, SSIMWAVE became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 As consideration for the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, the Company paid an aggregate purchase price of 23.2 million, comprised of: (i) 19.5 million in cash (ii) 160,547 common shares of the Company with a fair value of 1.9 million (the IMAX Share Consideration ), and (iii) contingent consideration with a fair value of 1.8 million (the Earn-Out Payment ). The fair value of the IMAX Share Consideration, which is based on the share price on the date of acquisition, is reduced to reflect the fair value of certain restrictions on the future transfer of the shares. The Earn-Out Payment may be paid to certain Sellers in an aggregate amount of up to 2.0 million in cash, contingent upon and following the achievement of certain commercial and financial milestones during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The fair value of the Earn-Out Payment is based on management's assessment of the likelihood of achieving these milestones. 
 (See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information related to the Company's acquisition of SSIMWAVE.)

The Company currently believes that over time its commercial multiplex network could grow to over 3,300 IMAX Systems worldwide from the 1,633 operating as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 74 of IMAX Systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada) respectively. Revenues and GBO derived from international markets continue to exceed revenues and GBO from the United States and Canada. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's revenue generated from its Greater China operations represents 24 of consolidated revenue, compared to 44 in 2021 and 38 in 2020 due to the impact of restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 794 IMAX Systems operating in Greater China with an additional 204 systems in backlog.

(1) Includes 38 IMAX Systems (2021 44) where the customer has the option to convert from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sales arrangement. 

(2) The consideration owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are accounted for as leases, is typically contingent on the box office receipts earned by the exhibitor. Accordingly, such arrangements do not usually have a dollar value in backlog; however, certain joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. 

(3) As of December 31, 2022, the Company's backlog includes 14 systems in Russia, one system in Ukraine, and five systems in Belarus with a total fixed contracted value of 22.9 million. 

The number of IMAX Systems in backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. The dollar value of backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX System sale and lease agreements that the Company expects to recognize as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements. The value of backlog does not include amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues or revenue from systems in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, and long-term conditional theater commitments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue. (See Risk Factors The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows. in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 Certain of the Company s contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing, but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections.

(1) Includes twelve IMAX Xenon Systems that were relocated from their original location (2021 nine). When a system under a sale or sales-type lease arrangement is relocated, the amount of revenue earned by the Company may vary from transaction-to-transaction and is usually less than the amount earned for a new sale. In certain situations when a system is relocated, the original location is upgraded to an IMAX Laser System.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management s judgments, assumptions, and estimates are based on historical experience, future expectations, and other factors that are believed to be reasonable as of the date of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from the Company s original estimates, as future events and circumstances sometimes do not develop as expected, and the differences may be material. Management believes that the following are the Company s most critical accounting estimates, which are not ranked in any particular order, that may affect the Company s reported results of operations and/or financial condition. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The application of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires management to make judgments and estimates. In addition, revenue contracts with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. 
 IMAX Systems 
 The Company evaluates each of the performance obligations in an IMAX System arrangement to determine which are considered distinct, either individually or in a group, for accounting purposes and which of the deliverables represent separate performance obligations. The transaction price in an IMAX System arrangement is allocated to each good or service that is identified as a separate performance obligation based on estimated standalone selling prices. This allocation is based on observable prices when the Company sells the good or service separately. 
 The Company s System Obligation consists of the following: (i) an IMAX System, which includes the projector, sound system, screen system and, if applicable, a 3D glasses cleaning machine; (ii) services associated with the IMAX System, including theater design support, the supervision of installation services, and projectionist training; and (iii) a license to use the IMAX brand to market the location. The System Obligation, as a group, is a distinct performance obligation. The Company is not responsible for the physical installation of the equipment in the customer s facility; however, it supervises the installation by the customer. The customer has the right to use the IMAX brand from the date the Company and the customer enter into an arrangement. 
 The Company has established standalone prices for the System Obligation and maintenance and extended warranty services, as well as for film license arrangements. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach for separate performance obligations that do not have standalone selling prices or third-party evidence of estimated standalone selling prices. The Company considers multiple factors including its historical pricing practices, product class, market competition and geography. 
 Constraints on the Recognition of Variable Consideration 
 The transaction price for the System Obligation, other than for IMAX Systems delivered pursuant to joint revenue sharing arrangements, consists of upfront or initial payments made before and after the final installation of the system and ongoing payments throughout the term of the arrangement. The Company estimates the transaction price, including an estimate of future variable consideration, received in exchange for the goods delivered or services rendered. The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX System includes indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include amounts owed by the customer based on a percentage of their box office receipts over the term of the arrangement. These contract provisions are considered to be variable consideration. An estimate of the present value of such variable consideration is recognized as revenue upon the transfer of control of the System Obligation to the customer, subject to constraints to ensure that there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal. 
 Variable consideration related to indexed minimum payment increases is outside of the Company s control, but the movement in the rates is historically well documented and economic trends in inflation are easily accessible. Accordingly, for each contract subject to an indexed minimum payment increase, the Company estimates the most likely amount using published indices. The amount of the estimated minimum payment increase is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using the customer s implied borrowing rate. 
 52 
 
 Variable consideration related to the level of the customer s box office receipts is outside of the Company s control as it is dependent upon the future commercial success of the films released to the IMAX network. The estimated variable consideration initially recognized by the Company is based on management s box office projections for the location, which are developed using historical box office data for that location and, if necessary, comparable locations and territories. Using this data, management applies its understanding of these location markets to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration to be earned over the term of the arrangement. Management then applies a constraint to this estimate by reducing the projection by a percentage factor for theaters or markets with no or limited historical box office experience. In cases where direct historical experience can be observed, average historical box office results, eliminating significant outliers, are used. The resulting amount of variable consideration is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using a risk-weighted discount rate. The Company reviews its variable consideration assets on at least a quarterly basis considering recent box office performance and, when applicable, updated box office projections for future periods. 
 Current Expected Credit Losses 
 The ability of the Company to collect its accounts receivable, financing receivables, and variable consideration receivables is dependent on the viability and solvency of individual theater operators which is significantly influenced by consumer behavior and general economic conditions. Theater operators and, in certain situations, movie studios, may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their payment obligations to the Company. 
 The Company develops its estimate of credit losses by class of receivable and customer type through a calculation that utilizes historical loss rates which are then adjusted for specific receivables that are judged to have a higher-than-normal risk profile after taking into account management s internal credit quality classifications, as well as macro-economic and industry risk factors. 
 Judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable, financing receivables, and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, are based on management s initial credit evaluation of the customer and the regular ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of each customer. This monitoring process includes an analysis of collections history and aging for each customer, as well as meetings on at least a monthly basis to identify credit concerns and potential changes in credit quality classification. A customer may improve their credit quality classification once a substantial payment is made on an overdue balance or when the customer has agreed to a payment plan and payments have commenced in accordance with that plan. Changes in credit quality classification are dependent upon management approval. 
 Management s judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management at the time that the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and involve estimates about the future. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the theatrical exhibition industry, the ability of the Company s customers to meet their financial obligations is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company s judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect. 
 (See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic . See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 Inventories 
 The Company records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory based upon management s judgments regarding future events and business conditions, including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts, contracts in negotiation, technological developments, growth prospects within the customers ultimate marketplace, and anticipated market acceptance of the Company s current and pending IMAX Systems. 
 (See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)

 Asset Impairments 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of the year and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. These indicators could include a decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization, a significant change in the outlook for the reporting unit's business, including projections of future box office results and IMAX System installations, lower than expected operating results, increased competition, legal factors, or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. For reporting units with goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management s current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company s estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management s estimates. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets are grouped and reviewed for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In such situations, long-lived assets are considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying value of the asset (or asset group). In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is written down to its fair value, which is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Factors that are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the long-lived asset will be sold significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant decrease in the market price of the long-lived asset, and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the long-lived asset is being used. 
 Film Assets 
 The recoverability of the Company s film assets is dependent upon the commercial acceptance of the underlying films and the resulting level of box office results and, in certain situations, ancillary revenues. If management s projections of future net cash flows resulting from the exploitation of a film indicate that the carrying value of the film asset is not recoverable, the film asset is written down to its fair value. 
 Valuation of Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired 
 Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets. The estimates used to value the identifiable intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of SSIMWAVE are based in part on historical experience, and information obtained from the management of the acquired business. The developed technology and in-process research and development acquired are valued utilizing income approaches, notable relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods using discounted cash flow models. The significant estimates used in valuing these intangible assets include assumptions related to revenue and gross margin forecasts, attrition rate, royalty rate and discount rates. The estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time. If management made different estimates or judgments, material differences in the fair values of the net assets acquired may result. 
 The estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time. If management made different estimates or judgments, material differences in the fair values of the net assets acquired may result. 
 (See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 The Company issues share-based compensation to eligible employees, directors, and consultants under the IMAX Corporation Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (as may be amended, the IMAX LTIP and the China Long-Term Incentive Plan (the China LTIP as summarized below. The IMAX LTIP is the Company s governing document and awards to employees, directors, and consultants under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted share units RSUs ), performance stock units PSUs and other awards. A separate stock option plan, the China LTIP, was adopted by a subsidiary of the Company in October 2012. 
 54 
 
 The Company measures share-based compensation expense using the grant date fair value of the award (as defined below), which is recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation expense is not adjusted for estimated forfeitures, but is instead adjusted when and if actual forfeitures occur. 
 The Company grants two types of PSU awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets, and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets. The achievement of the EBITDA and TSR targets in these PSUs is determined over a three-year performance period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from 0 to a maximum vesting opportunity of 175 of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and share-price targets. 
 The grant date fair value of PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is equal to the closing price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company s common shares for five days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with TSR targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a valuation model that considers the likelihood of achieving the TSR targets embedded in the award Monte Carlo Model ). The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 The fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company s share price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company s expected share price volatility over the term of the award, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the dollar value of the PSUs granted. 
 The amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is dependent upon management's assessment of the likelihood of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period that such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period that such determination is made. 
 (See Note 18(b) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 Deferred Income Tax Assets 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. 
 The Company assesses the realization of deferred income tax assets and based on all available evidence, concludes whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred income tax assets not considered to be realizable. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers, among other things, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If management determines that sufficient negative evidence exists, then management will consider recording a valuation allowance against all or a portion of the deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. If, after recording a valuation allowance, management s projections of future taxable income and other positive evidence considered in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate, it could prove more difficult to support the realization of these deferred tax assets. As a result, an additional valuation allowance could be required, which would have an adverse impact on the Company s effective income tax rate and results. Conversely, if, after recording a valuation allowance, management determines that sufficient positive evidence exists in the jurisdiction in which a valuation allowance is recorded, the Company may reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance in that jurisdiction. In such situations, the adjustment made to the deferred tax asset would have a favorable impact on the Company s effective income tax rate and results in the period such determination was made. 
 (See Notes 13(d) and 13(g) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 
 55 
 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 The Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. Although management believes that the Company has adequately accounted for its uncertain tax positions, tax audits can result in subsequent assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes above what was originally recognized in its financial statements. 
 Tax reserves for uncertain tax positions are adjusted by the Company to reflect management s best estimate of the outcome of examinations and assessments and in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with the uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. Some of these adjustments require significant judgment in estimating the timing and amount of the additional tax expense. 
 (See Note 13(h) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 Please see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact on the Company s financial statements. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The Company's business and future prospects are evaluated by Richard L. Gelfond, its Chief Executive Officer CEO ), using a variety of factors and financial and operational metrics including: (i) IMAX box office performance and the securing of new IMAX DMR films and other events to be exhibited across the IMAX network; (ii) the signing, installation, and financial performance of IMAX System arrangements, particularly those involving laser-based projection systems; (iii) the success of the Company's investments in business evolution and brand extensions, including the integration and performance of SSIMWAVE, the distribution of live events to the IMAX network, and IMAX Enhanced, (iv) revenues and gross margins earned by the Company's segments, as discussed below; (v) consolidated earnings (loss) from operations, as adjusted for unusual items; (vi) the continuing ability to invest in and improve the Company's technology to enhance the differentiation of The IMAX Experience versus other out-of-home experiences; (vii) the overall execution, reliability, and consumer acceptance of The IMAX Experience ; and (viii) short- and long-term cash flow projections. 
 The CEO is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), as such term is defined under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ). The CODM, along with other members of management, assesses segment performance based on segment revenues and gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development costs, the amortization of intangible assets, provision for (reversal of) current expected credit losses, certain write-downs, interest income, interest expense, and income tax (expense) benefit are not allocated to the Company's segments. 
 The Company's reportable segments are organized into the following three categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; and (iii) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) JRSA; (iii) IMAX Systems; (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) Film Distribution; and (vii) Film Post-Production, each of which are described above under Sources of Revenue. The Company's activities that do not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment are disclosed within All Other. This categorization is consistent with how the CODM reviews the financial performance of the Company and makes strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and investments to meet long-term business goals. Management believes that a discussion and analysis based on the three categories listed above is significantly more relevant and useful to readers, as the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations captions combine results from several segments. 
 In the first quarter of 2022, the Company's internal reporting was updated to reclassify the results of IMAX Enhanced out of the New Business Initiatives segment and into All Other for segment reporting purposes. IMAX Enhanced was the only component of the New Business Initiatives segment. Prior period comparatives have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. 
 56 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company has updated its internal reporting, including the information provided to the CODM to assess segment performance and allocate resources, and, as a result, will update its reportable segments in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2023. Following these changes, the Company will have two reportable segments: (i) Technology Products and Services, which will principally include the sale, lease, and maintenance of IMAX Systems, previously included within the JRSA, IMAX Systems, IMAX Maintenance, Other Theater Business segments, and (ii) Content Solutions, which will principally include content enhancement and distribution services, previously included within the IMAX DMR, Film Distribution and Film Post-Production segments. The Company s activities that do not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment will be reported within All Other. 
 The discussion of the Company s results of operations below compares results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. A discussion of the Company s results of operations comparing results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is included under the section entitled Results of Operations in Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net non-cash provision of 6.9 million, or 0.12 per share, due to an increase in reserves given the uncertainty of collecting receivables in Russia. This provision was taken due to the ongoing conflict and resulting sanctions in Ukraine and covers substantially all of the Company's net receivable exposure in the Russian market. Excluding the impact of this provision, net loss attributable to common shareholders was (15.9) million, or (0.28) per share, and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders was 10.1 million, or 0.18 per share. Over the past five years, Russia has represented on average approximately 3 of the GBO generated by IMAX films. 
 Revenues and Gross Margin 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's revenues and gross margin increased by 45.9 million (18 and 21.9 million (16 ), respectively, when compared to same period in 2021 principally due to the strength of the GBO performance of the IMAX Technology Network through the distribution of films such as Avatar: The Way of Water, Top Gun: Maverick , Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , Jurassic World Dominion , The Batman , Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thor: Love and Thunder, The Battle at Lake Changjin 2 , and Spider-Man: No Way Home .

(1) The revenue from this segment includes the initial upfront payments and the present value of fixed minimum payments from sale and sales-type lease arrangements of IMAX Systems, as well as the present value of estimated variable consideration from sales of IMAX Systems. To a lesser extent, the revenue from this segment also includes finance income associated with these revenue streams. 

(2) The revenue from this segment principally includes after-market sales of IMAX System parts and 3D glasses. 

(3) All Other includes the results from IMAX Enhanced, SSIMWAVE, and other ancillary activities. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company's internal reporting was updated to reclassify the results of IMAX Enhanced out of the New Business Initiatives segment into All Other for segment reporting purposes. Prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 

IMAX Technology Network 
 IMAX Technology Network results are influenced by the level of commercial success and box office performance of the films released to the IMAX network, as well as other factors including the timing of the films released, the length of the theatrical distribution window, the take rates under the Company s DMR and joint revenue sharing arrangements, and the level of marketing spend associated with the films released in the year. Other factors impacting IMAX Technology Network results include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, IMAX Technology Network revenues and gross margin increased by 39.8 million (34 and 28.8 million (43 ), respectively, when compared to the prior year. See below for separate discussions of IMAX DMR and JRSA contingent rent segment results for the year. 
 IMAX DMR 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, IMAX DMR revenues and gross margin increased by 24.2 million (34 and 13.2 million (29 ), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These increases are primarily due to the strong performance of the films distributed through the IMAX network, which resulted in a 211.5 million (33 increase in GBO, from 638.2 million in 2021 to 849.7 million in 2022, despite a 32 decline in Greater China box office. This overall improvement in GBO earned through the global IMAX network for the year was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, GBO was generated by the exhibition of 78 films (63 new, 10 carryovers, and five re-releases), including Avatar: The Way of Water , which generated GBO of 140.2 million (or 11 market share) and Top Gun: Maverick , which generated GBO of 110.7 million (or 7 market share) in the year. During the year ended December 31, 2021, GBO was generated by the exhibition of 73 films (63 new, 6 carryovers and four re-releases). 
 58 
 
 In addition to the level of revenues, IMAX DMR gross margin is also influenced by the costs associated with the films exhibited in the period, and can vary from period-to-period, especially with respect to marketing expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, marketing expenses were 17.3 million, as compared to 8.2 million in the prior year, which contributed toward the achievement of the Company s highest global and domestic market share of 3 and 5 , respectively, in 2022. 
 Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements Contingent Rent 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, JRSA contingent rent revenue and gross margin increased by 15.6 million (34 and 15.6 million (72 ), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These increases are primarily due to a 94.0 million (28 increase in GBO generated by systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements of 433.1 million in 2022 as compared to 339.1 million in 2021. 
 In addition to the level of revenues, JRSA contingent rent margin is also influenced by the level of costs associated with such arrangements, such as depreciation expense related to the underlying IMAX Systems and costs incurred to upgrade systems from IMAX Xenon Systems to IMAX Laser Systems, as well as advertising, marketing, and commission costs for these new systems. The level of depreciation expense in a period relative to the prior year is generally a function of the growth of the JRSA network and the mix of IMAX System configurations in the network. For the year ended December 31, 2022, JRSA gross margin included depreciation expense of 22.1 million, which is consistent with the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2022, JRSA gross margin includes advertising, marketing and commission costs of 0.7 million, as compared to 1.5 million in the prior year. 
 IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance 
 The primary drivers of IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance results are the number of IMAX Systems installed in a period, and the level of gross margin percentage earned on each installation, as well as the associated maintenance contracts that accompany each installation. The installation of IMAX Systems in newly built theaters or multiplexes, which make up a large portion of the Company s system backlog, depends primarily on the timing of the construction of those projects, which is not under the Company s control. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance revenue increased by 3.8 million (3 while gross margin decreased by 0.7 million, when compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by maintenance and after-market sales, partially offset by a decrease in system installations. See below for separate discussions of IMAX Systems and IMAX Maintenance results for the year.

(1) The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX System includes fixed upfront and ongoing consideration, including indexed annual minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. 

(2) Includes six IMAX Xenon Systems that were relocated from their original location, which are subject to sale and sales-type lease arrangements (2021 seven). When a system under a sale or sales-type lease arrangement is relocated, the amount of revenue earned by the Company may vary from transaction-to-transaction and is usually less than the amount earned for a new sale. In certain situations when a system is relocated, the original location is upgraded to an IMAX Laser System. 

59 
 
 The average revenue per IMAX System under sale and sales-type lease arrangements varies depending upon the number of IMAX System commitments with a single respective exhibitor, an exhibitor s location, the type of system sold and various other factors. 
 IMAX Systems 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, IMAX Systems revenue decreased by 2.7 million (4 ); however, gross margin increased 0.1 million, when compared to the prior year. The lower level of revenue is the result of four fewer IMAX System installations, including upgrades, in the current year under sale and sales-type lease arrangements and a decrease of 1.1 million in Finance Income associated with locations in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, which were placed on nonaccrual status due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions. These factors were partially offset by an increase of 5.0 million from the impact of amendments to existing IMAX System arrangements, as well as an increase of 3.3 million as the Company ended the temporary relief on annual minimum payment obligations for exhibitor customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 IMAX Maintenance 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, IMAX Maintenance segment revenue increased by 3.3 million (6 and gross margin decreased by 0.5 million, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The increase in IMAX Maintenance segment revenues is due to the continued global reopening of the IMAX network amidst the ongoing recovery of the theatrical exhibition industry from earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decrease of 1.2 million in revenue associated with systems in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, which were placed on nonaccrual status due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions. The decrease in gross margin compared to prior year is primarily due to 2.5 million maintenance revenue recognized in 2021 that had been deferred from 2020 due to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Maintenance margins vary depending on the mix of IMAX System configurations in the IMAX network, volume-pricing related to larger relationships and the timing and the date(s) of installation and/or service. 
 Film Distribution and Post-Production 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, Film Distribution and Post-Production revenues increased by 1.2 million (21 and gross margin decreased by 7.0 million, when compared to the prior year. The comparison of gross margin to the prior year is primarily the result of incremental costs incurred to produce, market and distribute live events and documentary content during the period. These costs include infrastructure costs, depreciation expense and network connection fees of 3.3 million to operate the IMAX connected network for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 The increase in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses reflects the Company's higher level of business activity in the current period, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to subside, resulting in higher staff costs, marketing expenses, and other expenses totaling 8.7 million. Also influencing the comparison to the prior year was 4.5 million resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, a decrease of 2.6 million in COVID-19 government relief benefits, 1.1 million in professional fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, and additional expenses of 2.2 million resulting from SSIMWAVE's operations in 2022 incurred subsequent to the acquisition date. 
 Research and Development 
 A significant portion of the Company s recent research and development efforts have been focused on its laser-based projection systems, which the Company believes present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, consume less power and last longer than other digital projection technologies, and are capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX network. To a lesser extent, the Company s recent research and development efforts have also focused on image enhancement technology, developing technologies and systems to help bring additional interactivity to its global IMAX network. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, Research and Development expenses decreased by 1.6 million (24 ), when compared to the prior year. 
 The Company intends to continue research and development to further evolve its end-to-end technology. This includes bringing connectivity to the Company s global network and experimenting with live and interactive events worldwide; developing new IMAX film cameras and certifying additional digital cameras; further improving its proprietary DMR process for the delivery of content for both theatrical (including local language content) and home entertainment; and further improving the reliability of its projectors, as well as enhancing the Company's image and sound quality. With the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, there is ongoing research and development in perceptual metrics including novel measurement and optimization techniques. Teams from IMAX and SSIMWAVE are working to expand existing and/or develop new technologies which are expected to further enhance video quality, delivery, and creation across devices. 
 Credit Loss Expense (Reversal), Net 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded current expected credit losses of 8.5 million principally due to reserves established against substantially all of its receivables in Russia due to uncertainties associated with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions, partially offset by the reversal of provisions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for locations in the Domestic and Rest of World markets as the outlook for the theatrical exhibition industry in these markets continues to improve. There remains a 1.5 million COVID-19 additional reserve for China. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net reversal of current expected credit losses of 4.0 million principally due to the reversal of previously recorded credit loss expense as a result of an improving outlook for theater operators following the reopening of IMAX locations in Domestic and Rest of World markets and the resumption of normal film release schedules as the theatrical exhibition industry continues to recover from the COVID-19 global pandemic, as well as better than anticipated collection experience with respect to foreign studio receivable balances. 
 Asset Impairment 
 On January 10, 2022, IMAX (Shanghai) Culture and Technology Co., Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China, entered into a joint film investment agreement with Wanda Film (Horgos) Co. Ltd. to invest RMB 30.0 million 4.7 million) in the movie Mozart from Space , which was released on July 15, 2022. Pursuant to the investment agreement, IMAX (Shanghai) Culture and Technology Co., Ltd. has the right to receive a share of the profits or losses of the film distribution. IMAX (Shanghai) Culture and Technology Co., Ltd.'s commitment is limited to its investment and has no further obligation if the actual movie production cost exceeds the original budget. The investment meets the criteria for classification as a financial asset. The investment is measured at amortized cost less impairment losses and is recorded within Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company recorded a full impairment of its RMB 30.0 million 4.5 million) investment in Mozart from Space based on projected box office results and distribution costs. 
 Legal Judgment and Arbitration Awards 
 In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a 1.8 million benefit within Legal Judgment and Arbitration Awards as a result of the settlement of the Giencourt matter, as discussed in Note 17(ii) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There was no comparable amount recorded during 2022. 
 61 
 
 Realized and Unrealized Investment Gains 
 In 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China, entered into a cornerstone investment agreement with Maoyan Entertainment Maoyan and purchased equity securities for 15.2 million. In 2021, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited sold all of its shares of Maoyan and recognized a gain of 5.2 million. 
 Interest Expense 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense was 5.9 million, representing a decrease of 1.2 million (17 when compared to interest expense of 7.1 million in the prior year. This decrease is principally due to repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings made in the prior year, partially offset by an expense of 0.4 million in unamortized deferred financing costs associated with lenders that are no longer parties to the Credit Agreement. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
 Income Taxes 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of 10.1 million (2021 20.6 million). The Company s effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2022 of (103.6) differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 26.5 , primarily due to the fact that the Company recorded an additional 16.9 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where management cannot reliably forecast that sufficient future tax liabilities will arise in specific jurisdictions, which includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the tax benefit associated with the current year's losses in these jurisdictions is not ultimately reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In 2022, the deferred tax liability for the applicable foreign withholding taxes decreased by 2.7 million since foreign withholding taxes were paid to the China tax authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 27.4 million of historical earnings from a subsidiary in China were distributed and, as a result, 2.7 million of foreign withholding taxes were paid to the relevant tax authorities. The remaining deferred tax liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 is 14.9 million. 
 In 2021, the deferred tax liability for the applicable foreign withholding taxes was increased by 0.5 million due to an increase in the amount of distributable historical earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 20.4 million of historical earnings from a subsidiary in China were distributed and, as a result, 2.0 million of foreign withholding taxes were paid to the relevant tax authorities. The remaining deferred tax liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 is 17.6 million. 
 (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements include the non-controlling interest in the net income or loss of IMAX China as well as the impact of non-controlling interests in the activity of its Original Film Fund subsidiary. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net income attributable to non-controlling interests of the Company s subsidiaries was 2.9 million (2021 12.8 million). The decrease in net income of 9.9 million from 2021 to 2022 can be primarily attributed to the temporary closure of theaters in several cities in China following the emergence of the Omicron variant in the first quarter of 2022, until the Chinese government relaxed its dynamic zero-COVID policies and eased capacity restrictions at the end of 2022.

 CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 
 Operating Activities 
 The net cash used in or provided by the Company s operating activities is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) the level of cash collections from customers in respect of existing IMAX System sale and lease agreements, (ii) the amount of upfront payments collected in respect of IMAX System sale and lease agreements in backlog, (iii) the box-office performance of films distributed by the Company and/or released to IMAX theaters, (iv) the level of inventory purchases, and (v) the level of the Company s operating expenses, including expenses for research and development and new business initiatives. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net cash provided by the Company s operating activities totaled 17.3 million, as compared to 6.1 million in the prior year. In 2022, the net cash provided by the Company s operating activities is principally a function of the Company s cash earnings, as well as in respect of Financing Receivables, partially offset by the increase in Accounts Receivable of 29.0 million resulting from revenue growth attributable to the strength of the box office performance of the films distributed through the IMAX network during the last quarter of the year and 19.6 million spent in connection with the development of Film Assets. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net cash inflow from operating activities of 6.1 million was principally a function of the Company s cash earnings, partially offset by the increase in Accounts Receivable of 52.5 million resulting from revenue growth attributable to the broader reopening of theaters as the theatrical exhibition industry recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. To a lesser extent, the cash provided by the Company s operating activities was also partially offset by 14.8 million spent in connection with the development of Film Assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net cash used in the Company s investing activities totaled 53.3 million, as compared to less than 0.1 million in 2021. In 2022, the net cash used in investing activities is driven by 15.9 million paid for the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, 19.8 million invested in equipment to be used in the Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitor customers, 4.7 million invested by IMAX (Shanghai) Culture and Technology Co., Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China, in the movie Mozart from Space (see Asset Impairment above), 8.4 million related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and 4.4 million of intangible assets acquired, principally related to the development of internal use software. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net cash used in the Company s investing activities totaled less than 0.1 million. In 2021, the net cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by 10.1 million invested in equipment to be used in the Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitor customers, 4.1 million of intangible assets capitalized, principally related to the development of internal use software, and 3.6 million related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment. This cash outflow is offset by 17.8 million in cash proceeds received from the sale of the Company's investment in Maoyan. 
 Capital expenditures, including the Company s investment in joint revenue sharing arrangements, the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of other intangible assets, and investments in films were 57.0 million in 2022 as compared to 32.6 million in 2021. The increase in capital expenditures reflects increased investments in the business and higher systems installation activity following a pandemic-driven pull-back in the prior two years. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net cash used in the Company s financing activities totaled 58.5 million, as compared to 132.7 million used by financing activities in the prior year. In 2022, the net cash used in financing activities is principally due to 83.2 million used to repurchase common shares of the Company 80.1 million) and IMAX China 3.0 million), 3.7 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, 2.7 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interests of IMAX China, and 2.3 million in fees paid in relation to the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into by the Company during the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by 34.3 million in net cash inflow from revolving credit facility borrowings. (See Note 15(b) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 1 for additional information on the issuance of the Convertible Notes and the related capped call transactions.) 
 63 
 
 In 2021, the net cash used by financing activities totaled 132.7 million, principally due to 304.0 million in net repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings, which were funded in part with a portion of the 223.7 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the Convertible Notes. The net cash used in financing activities for the year was also the result of the 19.1 million purchase of capped calls related to the Convertible Notes, as well as 24.0 million used to repurchase common shares of the Company 13.9 million) and IMAX China Holding, Inc. 10.1 million). 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company s principal sources of liquidity included: (i) its balances of cash and cash equivalents 97.4 million); (ii) the anticipated collection of trade accounts receivable, which includes amounts owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements and DMR agreements with movie studios; (iii) the anticipated collection of financing receivables due in the next 12 months under sale and sales-type lease arrangements for systems currently in operation; and (iv) installment payments expected in the next 12 months under sale and sales-type lease arrangements in backlog. Under the terms of the Company s typical sale and sales-type lease agreements, the Company receives substantial cash payments before it completes the performance of its contractual obligations. 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company also had 275.0 million in available borrowing capacity under its Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Credit Agreement ), 26.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the IMAX (Shanghai) Multimedia Technology Co., Ltd. IMAX Shanghai revolving credit facility with the Bank of China (the Bank of China Facility ), and 16.2 million in available borrowing capacity under IMAX Shanghai's revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the HSBC China Facility ). (See Note 15(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of the material terms of the Credit Agreement, the Bank of China Facility, and the HSBC Facility.) 
 The Company s 97.4 million balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021 189.7 million) includes 79.7 million in cash held outside of Canada (December 31, 2021 102.1 million), of which 43.7 million was held in the PRC (December 31, 2021 76.3 million). In 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company s capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. In 2021, 20.4 million of historical earnings from a subsidiary in China were distributed and, as a result, 2.0 million of foreign withholding taxes were paid to the relevant tax authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 27.4 million of historical earnings from a subsidiary in China were distributed and, as a result, 2.7 million of foreign withholding taxes were paid to the relevant tax authorities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a deferred tax liability of 14.9 million for the applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with the remaining balance of unrepatriated historical earnings that will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of Canada. These taxes will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings. 
 The Company forecasts its future cash flow and short-term liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis. These forecasts are based on estimates and may be materially impacted by factors that are outside of the Company s control (including the factors described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A). As a result, there is no guarantee that these forecasts will come to fruition and that the Company will be able to fund its operations through cash flows from operations. In particular, the Company s operating cash flows and cash balances will be adversely impacted if management s projections of future signings and installations of IMAX Systems and box office performance of IMAX DMR content are not realized. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, GBO generated by IMAX films totaled 849.7 million, surpassing the totals for 2021 by 211.5 million (33 ), despite a 32 decline in Greater China box office. Although GBO results during the year ended December 31, 2022 were impacted by the COVID-related theater closures in China, management remains encouraged by the overall positive trend in box office results and believes it indicates that moviegoers are returning to theaters, and in particular IMAX locations, where and when theaters are open and they feel safe. Despite accounting for approximately 1 of all domestic screens and less than 1 of all screens globally, the IMAX network had a domestic market share of 5 and a global market share of 3 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management is further encouraged by the return of the prevalence of exclusive theatrical windows and the strong pipeline of Hollywood movies scheduled to be released for theatrical exhibition throughout the remainder of 2023 and in Greater China, the significant easing of COVID-19-related safety protocols and capacity restrictions. 
 Based on the Company s current cash balances and operating cash flows, management expects to have sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its anticipated operating needs and capital requirements during the next twelve-month period following the date of this report.

 (See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Risk Factors The Company experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods in Part I, Item 1A.)

(2) The Company has an unfunded defined benefit pension plan, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP ), covering its CEO, Mr. Richard L. Gelfond. The SERP has a fixed benefit payable of 20.3 million. The table above assumes that Mr. Gelfond will receive a lump sum payment of 20.3 million six months after retirement at the end of the term of his current employment agreement, which expires on December 31, 2025, in accordance with the terms of the SERP, although Mr. Gelfond has not informed the Company that he intends to retire at that time.

The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. (See Note 15(b) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.) 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 There are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company s financial condition. 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this report, the Company presents financial measures in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis under the SEC regulations. Specifically, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its performance: 
 
 Adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders; 

Adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share; 

65 
 
 EBITDA; and 

Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. 

Adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income or loss attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share exclude, where applicable: (i) share-based compensation; (ii) COVID-19 government relief benefits; (iii) legal judgment and arbitration awards; (iv) realized and unrealized investment gains or losses; (v) acquisition-related expenses, as well as the related tax impact of these adjustments; and (vi) income taxes resulting from management s decision to no longer indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. 
 The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures that allow management and users of the Company s financial statements to view operating trends and analyze controllable operating performance on a comparable basis between periods without the after-tax impact of share-based compensation and certain unusual items included in net loss attributable to common shareholders . Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the Company s employee and executive compensation packages, it is a non-cash expense and is excluded from certain internal business performance measures. 
 Reconciliations of net loss attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share are presented in the table below.

In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, management also uses EBITDA, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, and which is referred to herein as Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. As allowed by the Credit Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility includes adjustments in addition to the exclusion of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure is presented to allow a more comprehensive analysis of the Company s operating performance and to provide additional information with respect to the Company s compliance with its Credit Agreement requirements, when applicable. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility presents relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company s industry to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company s results. 
 EBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (i) income tax expense or benefit; (ii) interest expense, net of interest income; (iii) depreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization; and (iv) amortization of deferred financing costs. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is defined as EBITDA excluding: (i) share-based and other non-cash compensation; (ii) realized and unrealized investment gains or losses; (iii) acquisition-related expenses and (iv) write-downs, net of recoveries, including asset impairments and credit loss expense.

The Company cautions users of its financial statements that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP amounts.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Quali tative Factors about Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. Market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by, for example, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. The Company s primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian Dollar CAD ), and Chinese Renminbi RMB ). The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 A majority of the Company s revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars while a significant portion of its costs and expenses is denominated in Canadian Dollars. A portion of the Company s net U.S. Dollar cash flows is converted to Canadian Dollars to fund Canadian Dollar expenses through the spot market. In addition, IMAX films generate box office in 87 different countries, and therefore unfavorable exchange rates between applicable local currencies and the U.S. Dollar could have an impact on the GBO generated by the Company s exhibitor customers and its revenues. The Company has incoming cash flows from its revenue generating IMAX network and ongoing operating expenses in China through its majority-owned subsidiary IMAX Shanghai. In Japan, the Company has ongoing Yen-denominated operating expenses related to its Japanese operations. Net RMB and Japanese Yen cash flows are converted to U.S. Dollars through the spot market. The Company also has cash receipts under leases denominated in RMB, Japanese Yen, Euros and Canadian Dollars. 
 The Company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge economic exposures as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. 
 Certain of the Company s PRC subsidiaries held approximately RMB 303.8 million or 43.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021 RMB 484.7 million or 76.0 million) and are required to transact locally in RMB. Foreign currency exchange transactions, including the remittance of any funds into and out of the PRC, are subject to controls and require the approval of the China State Administration of Foreign Exchange to complete. Any developments relating to the Chinese economy and any actions taken by the Chinese government are beyond the control of the Company; however, the Company monitors and manages its capital and liquidity requirements to ensure compliance with local regulatory and policy requirements. (See Risk Factors The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a foreign exchange net loss of (3.2) million as compared to a foreign exchange net gain of 1.3 million in 2021, associated with the translation of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily due to the weakening of the RMB against the USD throughout 2022. 
 The Company has entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risks associated with the volatility of foreign currencies. Certain of these foreign currency forward contracts met the criteria required for hedge accounting under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC at inception, and continue to meet hedge effectiveness tests as of December 31, 2022, with settlement dates throughout 2023. Foreign currency derivatives are recognized and measured in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations except for derivatives designated and qualifying as foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments. The Company currently has cash flow hedging instruments associated with Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments related to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, the effective portion of the gain or loss in a hedge of a forecasted transaction is reported within Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income and reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. For foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments related to Inventories, the effective portion of the gain or loss in a hedge of a forecasted transaction is reported within Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income and reclassified to Inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheets when the forecasted transaction occurs. For foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments related to capital expenditures, the effective portion of the gain or loss in a hedge of a forecasted transaction is reported within Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income and reclassified to Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets when the forecasted transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 68 
 
 The notional value of foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2022 was 24.7 million (December 31, 2021 26.7 million). A loss of (1.3) million was recorded to Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income with respect to the change in fair value of these contracts in 2022 (2021 gain of 0.5 million). A loss of (0.6) million was reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in 2022 (2021 gain of 1.7 million to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Inventories), primarily due to the weakening of the CAD against the USD throughout 2022. In 2022 there were no gains or losses resulting from a change in the classification of certain forward contracts no longer meeting the requirements for hedge accounting were reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (2021 gain of 0.3 million). The notional value of forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2022 was nil (December 31, 2021 nil). 
 For all derivative instruments, the Company is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent that the counterparty may not meet its obligations to the Company. To manage this risk, the Company enters into derivative transactions only with major financial institutions. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company s Financing Receivables and working capital items denominated in Canadian Dollars, RMB, Japanese Yen, Euros and other foreign currencies translated into U.S. Dollars was 85.5 million, of which 83.2 million was denominated in RMB. Assuming a 10 appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated financing receivables and working capital items would have been 8.6 million. A significant portion of the Company s Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses is denominated in Canadian Dollars. Assuming a 1 change appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, the potential change in the amount of Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses would be 0.2 million. 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 The Company s earnings may also be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash, and its interest expense from variable-rate borrowings that may be made under the Credit Facility. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company had drawn down 25.0 million on its Credit Facility (December 31, 2021 nil), 12.5 million on its HSBC China Facility (December 31, 2021 nil) and 0.4 million on its Bank of China Facility (December 31, 2021 3.6 million) which are subject to variable effective interest rates. 
 The Company had variable rate debt instruments representing 7.7 and 0.8 of its total liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. If the interest rates available to the Company increased by 10 , the Company's interest expense would increase by 0.2 million and interest income from cash would increase by 0.2 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt and cash balances as of December 31, 2022.

 Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of IMAX Corporation 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IMAX Corporation and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded SSIMWAVE from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded SSIMWAVE from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. SSIMWAVE is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 3 and less than 1 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

71 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Revenue Recognition IMAX Systems Revenue 
 As described in notes 3(o) and 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue from IMAX Systems related to the IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category (IMAX Systems) of 62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management evaluates whether an IMAX System arrangement involves either a sale or a lease of an IMAX System, and for those arrangements that are accounted for as a sale of an IMAX System, determines the transaction price and the allocation thereof to each separate performance obligation based on estimated standalone selling prices. For arrangements accounted for as a sale of an IMAX System, the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation is recognized when the conditions signifying transfer of control have been met. For IMAX System arrangements, management applied significant judgment in (i) determining whether the IMAX System arrangement related to either a sale or a lease by considering the terms of the arrangement including title to the IMAX System equipment and payment consideration; (ii) estimating the transaction price, which may include the discounted present value of fixed ongoing payments and variable consideration (such as indexed minimum payment increases and additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded); (iii) allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on estimated standalone selling prices; and (iv) determining the timing of revenue recognition based on when performance obligations are met. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the revenue recognition of IMAX Systems revenue is a critical audit matter are that management identified the matter as a critical accounting estimate, and there was significant judgment required by management in (i) determining whether the IMAX System arrangement related to a sale or a lease and, based on the type of sale or lease each arrangement represents, whether it falls in the scope of ASC 606 or ASC 842; (ii) estimating the transaction price, which may include the discounted present value of fixed ongoing payments and variable consideration; (iii) allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation; and (iv) determining the timing of revenue recognition. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the revenue recognition of IMAX Systems revenue. 
 
 72 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over management s review and approval of revenue recognition memoranda produced for each IMAX System arrangement, which include the determination of the type of IMAX System arrangement, the estimate of the transaction price and allocation thereof and the timing of the related revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment of whether the IMAX System arrangement related to either a sale or a lease by considering the contractual terms and conditions of the executed contracts. Procedures were also performed to test management s process for estimating the transaction price for a sample of contracts with customers, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted present value method; (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the data used in estimating the transaction price; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management, including the discount rate and expected future performance of underlying theatres associated with the arrangement. Evaluating management s assumption related to the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumption was reasonable considering consistency with external market data. Evaluating management s assumption related to expected future performance of underlying theatres associated with the arrangement involved evaluating whether the assumption was reasonable considering the current and past performance of the underlying theatres. Procedures were also performed to test management s process for allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management s method of allocating the transaction price; (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the data used in allocating the transaction price; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management, including estimated standalone selling prices. Evaluating management s assumption related to estimated standalone selling prices involved evaluating whether the assumption was reasonable by comparing the estimate to current and historical transactions. Evaluating the appropriateness of management s assessment of the timing of revenue recognition involved inspecting the customers certificates of acceptance and theatre openings during the year. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 As described in notes 3(n) and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had total tax reserves of 9.7 million as of December 31, 2022 related to uncertain tax positions. The Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As disclosed by management, tax audits can result in subsequent assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes above what was originally recognized. Tax reserves for uncertain tax positions are adjusted by management to reflect its best estimate of the outcome of examinations and assessments and in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with the uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. The estimate of the Company s tax reserves relating to uncertain tax positions required management to assess uncertainties and to make significant judgments about the application of complex tax laws. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining uncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the numerous and complex tax laws, frequency of tax audits and potential for significant adjustments as a result of such audits; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s timely identification, recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions; (iii) the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the tax reserves for uncertain tax positions resulted in significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often subjective; and (iv) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 73 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions and controls over measurement of the tax reserves. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the information used in the calculation of the tax reserves for uncertain tax positions; (ii) testing the calculation of the tax reserves for uncertain tax positions by jurisdiction; and (iii) evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities, as applicable. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and measurement of the Company s uncertain tax positions, including evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment of whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained and the amount of potential benefit to be realized, the application of relevant tax laws, and estimated interest and penalties. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivable, Financing Receivables and Variable Consideration Receivables 
 As described in notes 3(d) and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable was 14.1 million, the allowance for credit losses related to financing receivables was 11.7 million and the allowance for credit losses related to variable consideration receivables was 0.6 million as of December 31, 2022 (together, allowance for credit losses on receivables). Accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables are measured on the amortized cost basis and presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Management increased the allowance for credit losses by 7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management develops its estimate of credit losses by class of receivable and customer type through a calculation that utilizes historical loss rates, which are then adjusted for specific receivables that are judged to have a higher-than-normal risk profile after taking into account management s internal credit quality classifications, as well as macro-economic and industry risk factors. Management applied judgment in estimating the allowance for credit losses on receivables, which included assessing credit quality classifications and macro-economic and industry risk factors. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for credit losses on receivables is a critical audit matter are (i) the judgment by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses on receivables and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s assessment of credit quality classifications and macro-economic and industry risk factors. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimate of the allowance for credit losses on receivables, including controls related to management s assessment of credit quality classifications and macro-economic and industry risk factors. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for estimating the allowance for credit losses on receivables; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment of credit quality classifications and macro-economic and industry risk factors. Evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment of credit quality classifications and macro-economic and industry risk factors on a sample basis involved considering (i) recent payment patterns of customers; (ii) consistency with external market and industry data; (iii) inquiries with management regarding adjustments for forward-looking information on economic factors affecting the ability of customers to settle the receivables; (iv) recent correspondence with customers; (v) recent public filings by customers; and (vi) whether this assessment was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

 IMAX CORPORATION 
 NOTES TO CONSO LIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Tabular amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, unless otherwise stated) 
 
 of IMAX China Holding, Inc. IMAX China ), whose shares trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. IMAX China is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property, and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end solution to create superior, immersive content experiences for which the IMAX brand is globally renowned. Top filmmakers, movie studios, artists, and creators utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways. As a result, IMAX is among the most important and successful global distribution platforms for domestic and international tentpole films and, increasingly, exclusive experiences ranging from live performances to interactive events with leading artists and creators. The Company leverages its proprietary technology and engineering in all aspects of its business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other content into the IMAX format IMAX DMR and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems IMAX System(s) ). IMAX Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company s history since its founding in 1967. The customers for IMAX Systems are principally theater exhibitors that operate commercial multiplex theaters, and, to a much lesser extent, museums, science centers and destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the locations in the IMAX network, and is not an exhibitor, but instead sells or leases the IMAX System to exhibitor customers along with a license to use its trademarks and ongoing maintenance services. As of December 31, 2022, there were IMAX Systems operating in countries and territories, including commercial multiplexes, commercial destinations and institutional locations in the Company's global network. This compares to IMAX Systems operating in countries and territories as of December 31, 2021 including commercial multiplexes, commercial destinations, and institutional locations in the Company's global network. The Company also distributes large-format documentary films, primarily to institutional theaters, and distributes exclusive experiences ranging from live performances to interactive events with leading artists and creators. In addition, the Company provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films, whether produced by IMAX or third parties, and digital post-production services. The Company has the following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements JRSA ); (iii) IMAX Systems, (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) Film Distribution; and (vii) Film Post-Production, which are described in Note 22 . 

 of the IMAX network in Greater China was open at various capacities. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be accurately predicted and that will vary by jurisdiction and market. 

 80 
 
 film production companies, which have been identified as VIEs. The Company is the primary beneficiary of and consolidates of these entities as it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, and it has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the respective VIE that could potentially be significant. The majority of the assets relating to these production companies are held by the IMAX Original Film Fund (the Original Film Fund as described in Note 26 (b). The Company does not consolidate the other film production companies because it does not have the power to direct their activities and it does not have the obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses or the right to receive expected residual returns. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for these entities, which are not material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. A loss in value of an equity method investment that is other than temporary is recognized as a charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Total liabilities 

Commencing in March 2022, in response to numerous sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada and the European Union on companies transacting in Russia and Belarus resulting from ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Company suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus. As of December 31, 2022 , the IMAX network includes systems in Russia, systems in Ukraine, and system in Belarus, and the Company's backlog includes systems in Russia, system in Ukraine, and systems in Belarus with a total fixed contracted value of million. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded provisions for potential credit losses against substantially all of its receivables in Russia due to uncertainties associated with the ongoing conflict and resulting sanctions. These receivables relate to existing sale agreements as the Company is not party to any joint revenue sharing arrangements in these countries. In addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, exhibitors in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus were placed on nonaccrual status for maintenance revenue and finance income. Most multiplexes in Ukraine have reopened since the conflict began and the Company remains optimistic that its full network in Ukraine will ultimately resume operations. The Company continues to closely monitor the evolving impacts of this conflict (including the sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada and the European Union) and its effects on the global economy and the Company. (See Note 6 for more information on the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions on the Company's receivables and current expected credit losses.) On September 7, 2022, Cineworld Group plc Cineworld ), the parent company of Regal, and certain of its subsidiaries and Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC, filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. The Company had an unsecured pre-petition claim of million related to receivables from the entities included in the reorganization proceedings. On October 21, 2022, the Company was ratified by the bankruptcy court as a critical vendor of Cineworld, allowing the Company to collect pre-petition amounts owed to it by Cineworld, and requiring Cineworld to stay current on the Company s post-petition receivables. On November 8, 2022, IMAX Corporation entered into a trade agreement with Cineworld (the Trade Agreement ), pursuant to which Cineworld affirmed the amount of the receivables owed to the Company and agreed to a payment plan under which all amounts due will be settled over the period from November 9, 2022 to April 12, 2023. As of February 20, 2023, the Company had received payments of million from Cineworld in accordance with the terms of the Trade Agreement. Based on its evaluation of its contracts with Cineworld, its assessment of the reorganization and its discussions with Cineworld to date, the Company has determined that no additional provision for expected credit losses is required. The Company also does not expect to see a material impact on its IMAX network with Cineworld resulting from this reorganization. There can, however, be no guarantees as to the ultimate outcome of a Chapter 11 proceeding. 

Finished goods inventories includes IMAX Systems for which title has passed to the Company s customer in situations when the IMAX System has been delivered to the customer, but the criteria for revenue recognition were not met as of the balance sheet date. 
 following the date of the film s initial release. The recoverability of the Company s film assets is dependent upon the commercial acceptance of the underlying films and the resulting level of box office results and, in certain situations, ancillary revenues. If management s projections of future net cash flows resulting from the exploitation of a film indicate that the carrying value of the film asset is not recoverable, the film asset is written down to its fair value. Film exploitation costs, including advertising and marketing, are recorded in Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues Image Enhancement and Maintenance Services as incurred, except for those costs that are made after recognizing revenue, which are recorded when the related revenues are recognized.

The cost of IMAX System components and related equipment expected to be used in future joint revenue sharing arrangements, including related direct labor costs and an allocation of direct production costs, are recorded within assets under construction until the underlying IMAX System is installed and in working condition. These assets are depreciated to Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the term of the joint revenue sharing arrangement and the equipment s expected useful life. The estimated useful lives of the system components and related equipment used in joint revenue sharing arrangements are reviewed periodically to determine if any adjustments are required. Property, Plant and Equipment is grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying value of the asset (or asset group). In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is written down to its fair value, which is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Factors that are considered when evaluating such assets for impairment include a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the long-lived asset will be sold significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant decrease in the market price of the long-lived asset, and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the long-lived asset is being used. 

to years, except for intangible assets that have an identifiable pattern of consumption of the economic benefit of the asset. Such intangible assets are amortized over the consumption pattern. Research and development acquired in a business combination is measured at fair value using market-participant assumptions and is initially classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The in-process intangible research and development (IPR D) assets are considered indefinite-lived until the abandonment or completion of the associated research and development efforts. If the acquired IPR D project is abandoned, the related intangible would be written off or impaired. Once the IPR D activities are completed, management would determine the useful lives and the methods of amortization of the related intangible assets. The Company capitalizes costs associated with internally developed and/or purchased software systems for internal use that have reached the application development stage. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the internal-use software project. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are charged to expense. These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Intangible Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying value of the asset (or asset group). In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is written down to its fair value, which is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Factors that are considered when evaluating intangible assets for impairment include a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset will be sold significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant decrease in the market price of the intangible asset, and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the intangible asset is being used. 
 
 of statutory net profits to statutory surplus reserves, upon distribution of their after-tax profits. The Company s PRC subsidiaries may discontinue the appropriation of statutory surplus reserves when the aggregate sum of the statutory surplus reserve is more than of their registered capital. The statutory surplus reserve is non-distributable other than during liquidation and may only be used to fund losses from prior years, to expand production operations, or to increase the capital of the subsidiaries. In addition, the subsidiaries may make further contribution to a discretionary surplus reserve using post-tax profits in accordance with resolutions of the Board of Directors. 
 The Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. Although management believes that the Company has adequately accounted for its uncertain tax positions, tax audits can result in subsequent assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes above what was originally recognized in its financial statements. Tax reserves for uncertain tax positions are adjusted by the Company to reflect its best estimate of the outcome of examinations and assessments and in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with the uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. Some of these adjustments require significant judgment in estimating the timing and amount of the additional tax expense. 
 IMAX System arrangements are non-cancellable unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. In the absence of a material default by the Company, there is no right to any remedy for the customer under the Company s arrangements. If a material default by the Company exists, the customer has the right to terminate the arrangement and seek a refund only if the customer provides notice to the Company of a material default and only if the Company does not cure the default within a specified period. Sales Arrangements For IMAX System arrangements that qualify as a sale, the transaction price allocated to the System Obligation is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon the transfer of control of the system to the customer, which is when all of the following conditions have been met: (i) the projector, sound system, and screen system have been installed and are in full working condition, (ii) the 3D glasses cleaning machine, if applicable, has been delivered, (iii) projectionist training has been completed, and (iv) the earlier of (a) the receipt of written customer acceptance certifying the completion of installation and run-in testing of the equipment and the completion of projectionist training or (b) the public opening of the IMAX System. The initial revenue recognized in a sales arrangement consists of payments made before and in connection with the installation of the IMAX System and the present value of any future payments, including ongoing fixed minimum payments, which are subject to indexed increases over the term of the arrangement, and potential additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include amounts owed by the customer based on a percentage of their box office receipts over the term of the arrangement. Potential payments based on the future box office receipts of the customer are considered to be variable consideration. An estimate of the present value of such variable consideration is recognized as revenue upon the transfer of control of the System Obligation to the customer, subject to constraints to ensure that there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal (see Constraints on the Recognition of Variable Consideration below). The Company has also agreed, on occasion, to sell equipment under lease or at the end of a lease term. The transaction price agreed to for these lease buyouts is reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations within Revenues Technology Sales. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with the specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company have been excluded from the measurement of the transaction prices discussed above. Constraints on the Recognition of Variable Consideration The recognition of variable consideration involves a significant amount of judgment. Variable consideration is recognized subject to appropriate constraints to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in future periods. The Company reviews its variable consideration assets on at least a quarterly basis considering recent box office performance and, when applicable, updated box office projections for future periods. The relevant accounting guidance identifies the following examples of situations when constraining the amount of variable consideration is appropriate: The amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity s influence; 

 The uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time; 

 The Company s experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that experience has limited predictive value; and 

 The entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar contracts in similar circumstances. 

 As discussed above, the Company s significant streams of variable consideration relate to arrangements for the sale of IMAX Systems which include indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include variable consideration based on a percentage of the customer s box office receipts over the term of the arrangement. Variable consideration related to indexed minimum payment increases is outside of the Company s control, but the movement in the rates is historically well documented and economic trends in inflation are easily accessible. For each contract subject to an indexed minimum payment increase, the Company estimates the most likely amount using published indices. The amount of the estimated minimum payment increase is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using the customer s implied borrowing rate. Variable consideration related to the level of the customer s box office receipts is outside of the Company s control as it is dependent upon the future commercial success of the films released to the IMAX network. The estimated variable consideration initially recognized by the Company is based on management s box office projections for the location, which are developed using historical box office data for that location and, if necessary, comparable locations and territories. Using this data, management applies its understanding of these exhibition markets to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration to be earned over the term of the arrangement. Management then applies a constraint to this estimate by reducing the projection by a percentage factor for locations or markets with no or limited historical box office experience. In cases where direct historical experience can be observed, average historical box office results, eliminating significant outliers, is used. The resulting amount of variable consideration is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using a risk-weighted discount rate. 

Software License and Subscription Services Through SSIMWAVE, the Company provides term licenses, which give customers the right to use its software for a specific period, and perpetual licenses, which give customers the right to use its software for an indefinite period. For both types of licenses, the associated revenue is recognized at the point in time when the customer can use and benefit from the software, which is generally upon delivery to the customer or upon commencement of the renewal term. For licenses that are deployed and hosted at the customer site, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer or upon commencement of the renewal term. For licenses where the software is provided through a hosting arrangement, if the customer does not have a contractual right to take possession of the underlying software without significant penalty, or it is not feasible for the customer to run the software on its own hardware or contract a third party to host the services, the arrangement is accounted for as a service transaction whereby the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide the software over the license period. Therefore, the related revenue is recognized ratably over the license period, as control of service is transferred to the customer. SSIMWAVE's software license arrangements for both term and perpetual licenses typically include maintenance and support services which provide technical support and unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. The contractual term of the arrangement to provide maintenance and support services for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Maintenance and support services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Revenues from licenses and maintenance and support services are recognized within Revenues Image Enhancement and Maintenance Services. 
 of the Company s leases include options to purchase the leased property. Most of the Company s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that the lease term from one to or more. The depreciable lives of ROU assets and related leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. The Company s lease agreements do or material restrictive covenants. When there are modifications to the lease agreements, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities to reflect changes to lease payments and recognizes the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. Amortization of ROU assets and interest on lease liabilities are included within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. (See Note 7 for additional information related to the Company s operating leases.) 
 
 Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains, and losses recorded in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates prevailing during the period in which they are recognized. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income and reported on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income until the subsidiary is sold or liquidated, at which point the adjustments are recognized in Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency derivatives are recognized and measured in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations except for derivatives designated and qualifying as foreign currency hedging instruments. For foreign currency hedging instruments, the gain or loss related to the effective portion of the hedge of a forecasted transaction is reported within Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income and reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Performance Stock Units The Company grants two types of PSU awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets. The achievement of the EBITDA and TSR targets in these PSUs is determined over a performance period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from to a maximum vesting opportunity of of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and share-price targets. The Company s PSUs are classified as equity. The grant date fair value of PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is equal to the closing price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company s common shares for five days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with TSR targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a valuation model that considers the likelihood of achieving the TSR targets embedded in the award Monte Carlo Model ). The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company s share price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company s expected share price volatility over the term of the awards, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the dollar value of the PSUs granted. The amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is dependent upon management's assessment of the likelihood and timing of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made. Share-Based Payment Awards to Non-Employees Share-based payment awards for services provided by non-employees are measured at grant date fair value of the equity instruments that the Company is obligated to issue when the service has been rendered and any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. The grant date is the date which the Company and the non-employees reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the share-based payment awards. When there are performance conditions related to the vesting of the share-based awards, the Company assesses the probability of vesting at each reporting date and adjusts the compensation costs based on the probability assessment. 
 of the projected benefit obligation are amortized over the expected average remaining service life of the employees, and current service costs are expensed when earned. The remaining weighted average future service life of the employee used in computing the defined benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2022 was . For defined contribution pension plans, required contributions by the Company are recorded as an expense within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. A liability is recognized for the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of the postretirement benefits plan. Assumptions used in computing the accumulated benefit obligation are reviewed by management in consultation with its actuaries and adjusted for current conditions. Net benefit cost is split between operating income and non-operating income, where only the service cost is included in income from operations and the non-service components are included in Retirement Benefits Non-Service Expenses.

ASU 2021-05 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and adoption did t have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, 2021-08: Business Combinations (Topic 850): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers ASU 2021-08 ). ASU 2021-08 requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (e.g., deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, as opposed to at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to ASU 2021-08 in the third quarter of 2022 in connection with its acquisition of SSIMWAVE Inc. (see Note 5). In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, 2021-10: Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance ASU 2021-10 ). The amendments in ASU 2021-10 require annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company ASU 2021-10 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and has provided the required disclosures in Note 25. Recently Issued FASB Accounting Standard Codification Updates Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ASU 2020-04 ). The purpose of ASU 2020-04 is to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities from the beginning of an interim period that includes the issuance date of the ASU. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2020-04 prospectively through December 31, 2022. In October 2022, the FASB extended the temporary accounting relief to December 31, 2024 from the current sunset date of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is not party to any third party contracts that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Accordingly, the Company does not expect ASU 2020-04 to have a material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, 2022-02: Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 ). ASU 2022-02 amends and eliminates the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and requires for public business entities, to disclose current-period gross write offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. ASU 2022-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2022-02 for the first quarter of 2023 and is in the process of evaluating the accounting and disclosure impact, if any, on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all recently issued FASB accounting standard codification updates. Accounting standard updates that are not noted above were assessed and determined to be not applicable or not significant to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of SSIMWAVE pursuant to a share purchase agreement by and among the Company, SSIMWAVE, and related shareholders (the Sellers ). SSIMWAVE provides perceptual quality measurement and optimization solutions based on artificial intelligence technologies for leading media and entertainment companies. Following the acquisition, SSIMWAVE became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration for the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, the Company paid an aggregate purchase price of million, comprised of: (i) million in cash, (ii) common shares of the Company with a fair value of million (the IMAX Share Consideration ), and (iii) contingent consideration with a fair value of million (the Earn-Out Payment ). The fair value of the IMAX Share Consideration, which is based on the share price on the date of the acquisition, is reduced to reflect the fair value of certain restrictions on the future transfer of the shares. The Earn-Out Payment may be paid to certain Sellers in an aggregate amount of up to million in cash, contingent upon and following the achievement of certain commercial and financial milestones during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024, or under certain terms March 31, 2025. The fair value of the Earn-Out Payment is based on management's assessment of the likelihood of achieving these milestones. The revenues and earnings of SSIMWAVE for the period post-acquisition through December 31, 2022 were included in All Other for segment reporting and were not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company incurred million of professional fees in connection with the acquisition of SSIMWAVE, which were recorded within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has accounted for the acquisition of SSIMWAVE as a business combination and has completed its valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation and allocated million from Goodwill to Other Intangible Assets based on its valuation procedures and recognized the million of deferred tax liability related to this allocation. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company made an additional payment of million to certain former SSIMWAVE shareholders resulting from customary post-acquisition date working capital adjustments.

Goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and primarily represents future economic benefits arising from assets acquired that are not individually identified and separately recognized, including synergies and assembled workforce inherent in the acquired business. The goodwill recorded is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill associated with SSIMWAVE is in a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment assessment purposes. 

During the period when the accretion of Finance Income is suspended for Financing Receivables, any payments received from a customer are applied against the outstanding balance owed. If payments are sufficient to cover any unreserved receivables, a reversal of the provision is recorded to the extent of the residual cash received. Once the collectability issues are resolved and the customer has returned to being in good standing, the Company will resume recognition of Finance Income. When a customer s aging exceeds 90 days, the Company s policy is to perform an enhanced review to assess collectability of the theater s past due accounts. The over 90 days past due category may be an indicator of potential impairment as up to 90 days outstanding is considered to be a reasonable time to resolve any issues. The Company develops an estimate of expected credit losses by class of receivable and customer type through a calculation that utilizes historical loss rates which are then adjusted for specific receivables that are judged to have a higher-than-normal risk profile after considering management s internal credit quality classifications. Additional credit loss provisions are also recorded taking into account macro-economic and industry risk factors. The write-off of any billed receivable balance requires the approval of management. On September 7, 2022, Cineworld, the parent company of Regal, and certain of its subsidiaries and Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC, filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. The Company had an unsecured pre-petition claim of million related to receivables from the entities included in the reorganization proceedings. On October 21, 2022, the Company was ratified by the bankruptcy court as a critical vendor of Cineworld, allowing the Company to collect pre-petition amounts owed to it by Cineworld, and requiring Cineworld to stay current on the Company s post-petition receivables. On November 8, 2022, IMAX Corporation entered into a trade agreement with Cineworld (the Trade Agreement ), pursuant to which Cineworld affirmed the amount of the receivables owed to the Company and agreed to a payment plan under which all amounts due will be settled over the period from November 9, 2022 to April 12, 2023. As of February 20, 2023, the Company had received payments of million from Cineworld in accordance with the terms of the Trade Agreement. Based on its evaluation of its contracts with Cineworld, its assessment of the reorganization and its discussions with Cineworld to date, the Company has determined that no additional provision for expected credit losses is required. The Company also does not expect to see a material impact on its IMAX network with Cineworld resulting from this reorganization. There can, however, be no guarantees as to the ultimate outcome of a Chapter 11 proceeding. Management's judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management and involve estimates about the future. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company's judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect (see Note 2). The impacts of inflation, and rising interest rates may also impact future credit losses. The Company will continue to monitor economic trends and conditions and portfolio performance and adjust its allowance for credit loss accordingly. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable principally includes amounts currently due to the Company under IMAX System sale and sales-type lease arrangements, contingent fees owed by theater operators as a result of box office performance, and fees for maintenance services. Accounts receivable also includes amounts due to the Company from movie studios and other content creators principally for digitally remastering films into IMAX formats, as well as for film distribution and post-production services.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s allowance for current expected credit losses related to Accounts Receivable increased by million , principally due to reserves established against its receivables in Russia due to uncertainties associated with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions, partially offset by the reversal of provisions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as the outlook for the theatrical exhibition industry in Domestic and Rest of World markets continues to improve. There remains a million COVID-19 additional reserve for China. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s allowance for current expected credit losses related to Accounts Receivable decreased by million . This decrease is principally due to improved collection experience with respect to foreign studio receivable balances, partially offset by new provisions recorded in the period.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s allowance for current expected credit losses related to its net investment in leases and financed sale receivables increased by million . This increase is principally due to reserves established against its receivables in Russia due to uncertainties associated with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions, partially offset by the reversal of provisions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as the outlook for the theatrical exhibition industry in Domestic and Rest of World markets continues to improve. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s allowance for current expected credit losses related to its net investment in leases and financed sale receivables decreased by million . This decrease is principally due to the reversal of previously recorded credit loss expense as a result of an improving outlook for theater operators following the reopening of theaters and the resumption of normal film release schedules as the theatrical exhibition industry continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by new provisions recorded in the period. Variable Consideration Receivables In sale arrangements, variable consideration may become due to the Company from theater operators if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. Such variable consideration is recorded as revenue in the period when the sale is recognized and adjusted in future periods based on actual results and changes in estimates. Variable consideration is only recognized to the extent the Company believes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal.

 Most of the Company s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that the lease term from one to or more. The Company has determined that it is reasonably certain that the renewal options on its warehouse leases will be exercised based on previous history, its current understanding of future business needs, and its level of investment in leasehold improvements, among other factors. of the Company s leases include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable lives of right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. The Company s lease agreements do or material restrictive covenants. In 2022, the Company entered into a finance lease arrangement involving equipment used to facilitate the delivery of live events to certain IMAX locations. The lease arrangement includes an option for the Company to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term that is reasonably certain to be exercised. The resulting right-of-use assets are being depreciated from the lease commencement dates over the useful life of the underlying equipment. The incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of the lease liabilities is based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term.

 The customer s rights under the Company s sales-type lease arrangements are described in Note 3 (o). Under the Company s sales-type lease arrangements, the customer has the ability and the right to operate the hardware components or direct others to operate them in a manner determined by the customer. The Company s lease portfolio terms are typically non-cancellable for to with renewal provisions from inception. The Company s sales-type lease arrangements do not contain a guarantee of residual value at the end of the lease term. The customer is required to pay for executory costs such as insurance and taxes and is required to pay the Company for maintenance and an extended warranty generally after the first year of the lease until the end of the lease term. The customer is responsible for obtaining insurance coverage for the IMAX System commencing on the date specified in the arrangement s shipping terms and ending on the date the IMAX System is returned to the Company. The Company also provides IMAX Systems to customers through joint revenue sharing arrangements. Under the traditional form of these arrangements, in exchange for providing the IMAX System under a long-term lease, the Company earns rent based on a percentage of contingent box office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront fee or annual minimum payments. Under certain other joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX System. Under joint revenue sharing arrangements, the customer has the ability and the right to operate the hardware components or direct others to operate them in a manner determined by the customer. The Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements are typically non-cancellable for years with renewal provisions. Title to the IMAX System under a joint revenue sharing arrangement generally does not transfer to the customer. The Company s joint revenue sharing arrangements do not contain a guarantee of residual value at the end of the lease term. The customer is required to pay for executory costs such as insurance and taxes and is required to pay the Company for maintenance and an extended warranty throughout the term. The customer is responsible for obtaining insurance coverage for the IMAX System commencing on the date specified in the arrangement s shipping terms and ending on the date the IMAX System is returned to the Company.

Investment tax credits and other tax credits of million can be carried forward to reduce income taxes payable through to . (f) Indefinitely Reinvested Assertion 

 Income taxes are accrued for the earnings of non-Canadian affiliates and associated companies unless management determines that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested outside of Canada. In 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company s capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. The Company's deferred tax liability of million as of December 31, 2021 related to the estimated applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , million of historical earnings from a subsidiary in China were distributed and, as a result, million of foreign withholding taxes were paid to the relevant tax authorities 2021 million).

(h) Uncertain Tax Positions 

 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had total tax reserves (including interest and penalties) of million and million , respectively, for various uncertain tax positions. While the Company believes it has adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from the Company's accrued liability. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal, provincial, state and foreign tax-related matters may be required in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net decrease of million related to reserves (excluding interest and penalties) for income taxes (2021 million , 2020 million ). The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities, when applicable, as part of the Income Tax Expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than Interest Expense. The Company expensed million in potential interest and penalties associated with its provision for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2022 (2021 expensed million ; 2020 expensed million ).

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Company's material taxing jurisdictions include Canada, the United States, Ireland, and China. In 2021, the Canadian tax authorities denied the Company s deduction of certain foreign taxes accrued in 2015, but not yet paid as discussions with the local authorities are ongoing. This resulted in the payment of million in income taxes and million in associated interest to the Canadian tax authorities in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company has filed a waiver with the Canadian tax authorities in respect of 2015 so that when the foreign taxes are paid, the Company would be entitled to receive a refund of the million in tax, which is recorded on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accounts Receivable, and the million in associated interest. The Company's through tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for United States federal tax purposes, and the through tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Canadian federal tax purposes. There are other on-going audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is subject to audit by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it operates in the ordinary course of its business and believes that it has adequately reserved for the expected exposures in its accounts. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received a Notice of Reassessment (the Reassessment in the amount of million (inclusive of interest). Although the CRA is continuing its audit and has requested additional information to continue its evaluation of the facts, a Reassessment was necessary as the time limitation for assessment as imposed under the relevant income tax treaty was set to expire before the audit could be completed. The Company believes that the matter will be resolved on a basis that is consistent with its filing position. (i) Income Tax Effect on Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

Convertible Notes 
 On March 19, 2021, the Company issued million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Convertible Notes in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes were million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions. In addition, the Company paid million of debt issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to make a partial repayment of previous outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings, and used the remainder for working capital or other general corporate purposes. per annum on the principal of million, payable in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on . The Convertible Notes will mature on , unless they are redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted on an earlier date. common shares per principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per common share, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time. In addition, calling any Convertible Notes for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such notes, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such notes will be increased in certain circumstances if such notes are converted after they are called for redemption . In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined below), holders may require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, a fundamental change means, among other things, an event resulting in (i) a change of control, (ii) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) a merger, (iv) liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (v) delisting of the Company s common shares from a national securities exchange. The Company recorded the Convertible Notes entirely as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and other debt issuance costs, with interest expense reflecting the cash coupon plus the amortization of the discounts and capitalized costs. Additionally, under the if-converted method, because the principal amount of the Convertible Notes is settled in cash and the conversion spread is settleable in the Company's common shares, diluted earnings per share is calculated by including the net number of incremental shares that would be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, using the average market price during the period. Accordingly, the application of the if-converted method may reduce the Company's reported diluted earnings per share. In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution resulting from the common shares the Company is required to issue and/or to offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common shares is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of per share of the Company s common shares, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the common shares when they were priced on March 16, 2021, and are subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of the Company s common shares underlying the Convertible Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was approximately million. The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes and will not affect any holder s rights under the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance with ASC 815-10-15-74(a), Derivatives and Hedging Embedded Derivatives Certain Contracts Involving an Entity s Own Equity, and, as a result, the related million cost was recorded as a reduction to Other Equity within Shareholders Equity on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Federal Economic Development Loan SSIMWAVE entered into a contribution agreement with the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (the Federal Economic Development Loan on May 29, 2019, under which SSIMWAVE may receive up to million Canadian Dollars CAD ( million) by way of repayable contributions toward certain eligible projects costs. The contributions under the agreement cover of the eligible and supported costs of SSIMWAVE between January 10, 2019 and December 31, 2022. The contributions are repayable over , with repayments estimated to begin in , with an annual interest rate of . As of December 31, 2022, SSIMWAVE has received contributions of CAD million million from the Federal Economic Development Loan. The benefit of the interest free loan has been determined by calculating the present value of the payments using a market-based interest rate and comparing this to the proceeds received. The benefit is being recorded as the interest free benefit of government funding within Interest Income on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. No benefit was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022, as the Company did not receive any funding since the date of acquisition. The obligation is being accreted to its maturity amount, resulting in an interest accretion expense of less than million in 2022 and is being recorded within Interest Expense on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 (i) In January 2004, the Company and IMAX Theatre Services Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, commenced an arbitration seeking damages before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the ICC with respect to the breach by Electronic Media Limited EML of its December 2000 agreement with the Company. In June 2004, the Company commenced a related arbitration before the ICC against EML's affiliate, E-City Entertainment (I) PVT Limited E-City ). On March 27, 2008, the arbitration panel issued a final award in favor of the Company in the millio n, consisting of past and future rents owed to the Company, plus interest and costs, as well as an additional each day in interest from October 1, 2007 until the date the award is paid . In July 2008, E-City commenced a proceeding in Mumbai, India seeking to prevent recognition of the ICC award in India. On March 10, 2017, the Supreme Court dismissed E-City's petition. On March 29, 2017, the Company filed an Execution Application in the Bombay High Court seeking to enforce the ICC award against E-City and several related parties, which award the Company calculates to be million, inclusive of interest, as of December 31, 2022. That matter is currently pending. The Company has also taken steps to enforce the ICC final award outside of India. In December 2011, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice issued an order recognizing the final award and requiring E-City to pay the Company to cover the costs of the application , and in May 2012, the New York Supreme Court recognized the Canadian judgment and entered it as a New York judgment. The Company intends to continue pursuing its rights and seeking to enforce the award, although no assurances can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome. (ii) On November 11, 2013, Giencourt Investments, S.A. Giencourt initiated arbitration before the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in Miami, Florida, based on alleged breaches by the Company of its theater agreement and related license agreement with Giencourt. On February 7, 2017, the panel issued a Partial Final Award and on July 21, 2017, the panel issued a Final Award (collectively, the Award ), which held that the parties had reached a binding settlement, and therefore the panel did not reach a decision regarding the merits of the dispute. On December 3, 2020, the District Judge entered a final judgment (the Final Judgment against the Company in the total amount of million as damages under the Award. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets included a liability within Accrued and Other Liabilities of million related to the Final Judgment, consisting of million related to amounts collected from or owed to Giencourt principally in respect of theater systems that were not delivered and million in respect of the remaining amounts owed under the Final Judgment. On June 23, 2021, the Company entered into a final settlement agreement with Giencourt to fully resolve all disputes between the parties in the United States and Ontario (the Settlement Agreement ). In the second quarter of 2021, the Company paid Giencourt million as required by the terms of the Settlement Agreement. As a result of the Settlement Agreement, the Final Judgment has been vacated, all litigation between the parties in all jurisdictions has been dismissed and full and final releases have been exchanged by the parties. Accordingly, upon entry in the Settlement Agreement on June 23, 2021, the remaining million liability recorded within Accrued and Other Liabilities was reversed and a corresponding million benefit was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations within Legal Judgment and Arbitration Awards in the second quarter of 2021. (iii) In addition to the matters described above, the Company is currently involved in other legal proceedings or governmental inquiries which, in the opinion of the Company's management, will not materially affect the Company's financial position or future operating results, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. (iv) In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may contain features that meet the definition of a guarantee. A guarantee is a contract (including an indemnity) that contingently requires the Company to make payments (either in cash, financial instruments, other assets, shares of its stock, or provision of services) to a third party based on (a) changes in an underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity or commodity instrument, index or other variable, that is related to an asset, a liability or an equity security of the counterparty, (b) failure of another party to perform under an obligating agreement or (c) failure of another third party to pay its indebtedness when due. Financial Guarantees Certain subsidiaries of the Company have provided significant financial guarantees to third parties under the Credit Agreement (see Note 15). Product Warranties The Company s accrual for product warranties, which is recorded within Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Director/Officer Indemnifications The Company s by-laws contain an indemnification of its directors/officers, former directors/officers, and persons who have acted at its request to be a director/officer of an entity in which the Company is a shareholder or creditor, to indemnify them, to the extent permitted by the Canada Business Corporations Act , against expenses (including legal fees), judgments, fines and any amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit or proceeding in which the directors and/or officers are sued as a result of their service, if they acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors in order to effectuate the foregoing. The nature of the indemnification prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to counterparties. The Company has purchased directors and officers liability insurance. amount has been accrued in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 with respect to this indemnity. Other Indemnification Agreements In the normal course of its operations, the Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in transactions such as: IMAX System lease and sale agreements and the supervision of installation or servicing of IMAX Systems; film production, exhibition and distribution agreements; real property lease agreements; and employment agreements. These indemnification agreements require the Company to compensate the counterparties for costs incurred as a result of litigation claims that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction or the Company s breach or non-performance under these agreements. While the terms of these indemnification agreements vary based upon the contract, they normally extend for the life of the agreements. A small number of agreements do not provide for any limit on the maximum potential amount of indemnification; however, virtually all of the IMAX System lease and sale agreements limit such maximum potential liability to the purchase price of the system. The fact that the maximum potential amount of indemnification required by the Company is not specified in some cases prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to counterparties. Historically, the Company has t made any significant payments under such indemnifications and no amounts have been accrued in the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to the contingent aspect of these indemnities.

The Company no longer intends to issue new stock option awards. The Company utilizes a Binomial Model to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date. The fair value determined by the Binomial Model is affected by the Company s stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Binomial Model also considers the expected exercise multiple which is the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company s employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in management s opinion, the Binomial Model best provides a fair measure of the fair value of the Company s employee stock options. All stock option awards are granted at the fair market value of the Company s common shares on the date of grant. The fair market value of a common share on a given date is based on the higher of the closing price of a common share on either: (i) the grant date or (ii) the most recent trading date if the grant date is not a trading date on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE or such national exchange as may be designated by the Company s Board of Directors. The stock options vest within years and expire years or less from the date of grant. The SOP and IMAX LTIP provide for double-trigger accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control, as defined in each plan. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations includes an income tax benefit of million related to stock option expense (2021 million ; 2020 million ).

Restricted Share Units to Non-Employees During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , the Company did t grant any stock options to non-employees. The Company did t record any expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to RSU grants issued to advisors and strategic partners of the Company (2021 nil; 2020 million). IMAX LTIP Performance Stock Units Summary In 2020, the Company expanded its share-based compensation program to include PSUs. The Company grants two types of PSUs awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets. The achievement of the EBITDA and TSR targets in these PSUs is determined over a performance period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from to a maximum vesting opportunity of of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and stock-price targets. The grant date fair value of PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is equal to the closing price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company s common shares for five days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with TSR targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a valuation model that considers the likelihood of achieving the TSR targets embedded in the award Monte Carlo Model ). The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company s share price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company s expected share price volatility over the term of the awards, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the fair value of the PSUs granted. The amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is dependent upon management's assessment of the likelihood of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period that such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management s assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period that such determination is made. 

The Company s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of PSUs was nil for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021 nil; 2020 nil). As of December 31, 2022 , total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested PSUs and the weighted average period over which the expense is expected to be recognized is million and years, respectively.

(b) Deferred Revenue 

 IMAX System sale and lease arrangements include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement, subject to a consumer price index adjustment each year. In circumstances where customers prepay the entire term s maintenance fee, additional payments are due to the Company for the years after its extended warranty and maintenance obligations expire. Payments upon renewal each year are either prepaid or made in arrears and can vary in frequency from monthly to annually. As of December 31, 2022, million of consideration has been deferred in relation to outstanding maintenance services to be provided on existing maintenance contracts (December 31, 2021 million and 2020 million). Maintenance revenue is recognized evenly over the contract term which coincides with the period over which maintenance services are provided. In the event of customer default, any payments made by the customer may be retained by the Company. In instances where the Company receives consideration prior to satisfying its performance obligations, the recognition of revenue is deferred. The majority of the deferred revenue balance relates to payments received by the Company for IMAX Systems where control of the system has not transferred to the customer. The deferred revenue balance related to an individual system increases as progress payments are made and is then derecognized when control of the system is transferred to the customer. Recognition dates are variable and depend on numerous factors, including some outside of the Company s control.

(c) Foreign Exchange Risk Management 

 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency rates. A majority of the Company s revenues is denominated in U.S. Dollars while a significant portion of its costs and expenses is denominated in Canadian Dollars. A portion of the Company s net U.S. Dollar cash is converted to Canadian Dollars to fund Canadian Dollar expenses through the spot market. In China and Japan, the Company has ongoing operating expenses related to its operations in RMB and Japanese Yen, respectively. Net cash flows are converted to and from U.S. Dollars through the spot market. The Company also has cash receipts under leases denominated in RMB, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, and Euros which are converted to U.S. Dollars through the spot market. In addition, because IMAX films generate box office in different countries, unfavorable exchange rates between applicable local currencies and the U.S. Dollar could have an impact on box office receipts and the Company s revenues and results of operations. The Company s policy is to not use any financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company has entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risks associated with the volatility of foreign currencies. Certain of these foreign currency forward contracts met the criteria required for hedge accounting under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC at inception, and continue to meet hedge effectiveness tests as of December 31, 2022 (the Foreign Currency Hedges ), with . Foreign currency derivatives are recognized and measured in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations except for derivatives designated and qualifying as foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments. The Company currently has cash flow hedging instruments associated with Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments related to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, the effective portion of the gain or loss in a hedge of a forecasted transaction is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income and reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Item 9A. Control s and Procedures 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its CEO and its CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022 and has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Company will continue to periodically evaluate its disclosure controls and procedures and will make modifications from time to time as deemed necessary to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 
 Management has used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) to assess the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 On September 22, 2022, the Company acquired SSIMWAVE and commenced consolidating the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of SSIMWAVE in its financial reporting. Management has excluded SSIMWAVE from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. SSIMWAVE is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 3 and less than 1 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report, which appears in Part II, Item 8. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
