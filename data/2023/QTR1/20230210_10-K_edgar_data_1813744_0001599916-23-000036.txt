SkyFight-X 

SkyFight-X, was originally developed and designed by our Chief Executive Officer, specifically for the hobbyist drone race known as SKY
FIGHT , which is organized by Drone Net, a Japanese Company. Drone Net began operating a drone school in 2017, and
a drone race in 2019. At the tie, our CEO, Ryohei Uetaki, was in the planning stages of a new, small sized drone product, and believed
that his products would have higher performance capabilities than the drones at the time used by Drone Net, which prompted him to propose
a collaboration between the Company and Drone Net. Currently, Drone Net operates 16 racetracks in Japan, specifically designed for drone
use. 

Although SkyFight-X was designed for Sky Fight, the drones can also be
used outside the facilities designed exclusively for drone racing, and they can be used for recreational and miscellaneous purposes. 

The following includes details regarding the SkyFight-X which we currently
offer for sale. As mentioned later on, we have plans to expand our reach to more customers, but at this time it should be noted our only
customer is Drone Net.

Structure of Operations of SkyFight-X 

At
present, the majority of the Company s operations are carried out in the following manner: 

(1)
The Company receives an order for the Company s products from Drone Net. 

In
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, entered into on March 1, 2020, Drone Net shall not develop, manufacture, purchase or
sell similar products to SkyFight-X without the Company s consent through February 28, 2023. 

(2)
The Company places orders to G-Force, Inc., a Japan corporation G-Force to manufacture the Products, in accordance with
the terms outlined in the agreement entered into on March 4, 2020. 

(3)
G-Force purchases lap measuring sensors (the Sensors from ShenZhen RadioMaster Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation RadioMaster ).
The sensors are later installed in the SkyFight-X Drones. 

(4)
The Sensors are installed into the drones manufactured by G-Force on behalf of the Company. 

(5)
G-Force manufactures the Products and installs the Sensors. G-Force is a non-exclusive OEM supplier of the Company. After completion
of the production process, the Company conducts a final product inspection of the goods produced. During the inspection, on average,
the Company physically inspects between five to ten percent of the products for quality control. 

(6)
Following inspection and acceptance of the products, the Company directs G-Force to deliver the products to a location designated by
Drone Net; currently the warehouse of Drone Net is in Toyko, Japan, and G-Force delivers the products there directly. 

(7)
The Company relies on the marketing and sales of Drone Net, in part for its own success. If Drone Net realizes increased demand for the
products, then in turn our own operations will increase and benefit from more sales. It should be noted that, at present, Drone Net is
our prim ary customer. 

Marketing 

Our marketing plan, at present, is not yet complete and is still being
researched and developed. SkyFight-X, our current primary product, is being marketed solely by our primary customer, Drone Net. We believe
that Drone Net s sales of our products will result in increased demand from Drone Net for future products, but this is not directly
related to any marketing activities conducted by the Company itself. We do not currently engage in any marketing efforts, with the exception
of the company s website located at: https://www.world-scan-project.com/

ZEXABOX 

 ZEXABOX is made pursuant to, what we believe to be, strict Japanese
guidelines for quality. The device is a GPU Mining Rig, comprised of computer components, used to mine digital currency.
In layman s terms, mine is defined as the process of solving complex math problems that verifying transaction(s) in
the digital currency or blockchain, which, generally speaking, results in a predetermined amount of digital currency to be gained.

Future plans 

World Scan Project, Inc., as an industrial automation
equipment manufacturer, plans to further develop and apply our technologies in designing/developing Web3 infrastructure note ,
IoT equipment and other related products, in addition to the robots and drones we have been offering to the market globally. 

Note: Internally, we are discussing further plans to develop
mining rigs, general purpose IoT equipment, and equipment for data centers. An example of general purpose IoT equipment is the digital
currency mining rig, ZEXABOX DIV. 

(1) To expand the revenues from Drone Net 

It is our understanding that Drone Net has plans
to increase its instructional programs, shops and racetracks. The Company expects to increase revenue according to the business expansion
of Drone Net. At present, the exact amount that Drone Net will increase its orders in the future is speculative, and we will need to evaluate
in greater detail as the scope of Drone Net s operations increases, if of course it does increase. 

(2) To begin direct sales to consumers in Japan 

The Company has tentative plans to evaluate the
possibility of directly selling its products via web-based direct sales in Japan. It is possible that we may evaluate, and even begin
to do so in 2023, but we do not currently have any definitive plans to do so at this point in time. 

(3) To expand the sales volume for our digital
currency mining rigs 

The Company is planning to gain sales agents and
agencies to expand the sales of its new product named XEXABOX series. 

(4) To start selling products overseas, mainly
in the USA 

The Company has intentions to begin developing
its own sales agencies, and at such time to begin to sell products through such agencies, overseas beginning, potentially, in 2023. These
plans remain speculative in nature, however, in order to begin to progress these efforts, the Company entered into a consulting agreement
with Pine Hill Productions, Inc., a New York corporation (Pine Hill on March 3, 2020. Pine Hill shall support the Company to expand
its business operations into the USA. The consulting fee due to Pine Hill is 3,000 per month. 

(5) To develop new products 

The Company will develop core products other than drones and digital
currency mining rigs. 

(6) The Company also have tentative plans, which have not progressed beyond
ideas at this point, to evaluate the possibility of working on developing an underwater drone and a hover bike (flying bike). We are exploring
the feasibility of these endeavors, however, there is no guarantee that such plans will come to fruition. 

(7) The Company studies the feasibility of solutions for data centers. 

Government Regulations in Japan 

Given that the entirety of our operations are conducted within Japan, and
our customers reside in Japan, only the rules and regulations pertaining to Japan are presently applicable to the Company s operations
relating to drones. 

The Aviation Act prohibits flying drones over residential areas or areas
surrounding an airport without permission from the Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation. Flying drones during night time
and during an event is also prohibited. In addition, drones no lighter than 200 grams in unrestricted areas across the country are required
to stay below 150 meters (492 feet), and also be kept at least 30 meters (98 feet) from people, buildings, and vehicles. 

Given that SkyFight-X is lighter than 200 grams, flying SkyFight-X s
for the purposes of drone racing or participating in drone flying schools is not prohibited by any pertinent regulations in Japan. We
are not subject to specific regulations pertaining to the manufacturing and design of the SkyFight-X at this time.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 

No applicable because the Company is a smaller reporting

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As
of October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 5,836,065 and
 2,583,218, respectively. The increase in cash is attributed to an increase in revenues. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient
to fund our operations without the need for additional funding. 

Revenues 

We
recorded revenue of 29,440,341 for
the year ended October 31, 2022 as opposed to 11,813,816 for the year ended October 31, 2021. 

Net Income 

We
recorded net income of 8,908,782 for the year ended October 31, 2022 and net income of 2,332,451 for the year ended October 31, 2021.
The increase in net income is attributed to an increase in revenue from 2021 to 2022 . 

Cash flow 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, we had cash flows from operations in the amount of 4,605,591 .
For the year ended October 31, 2021, we had cash flows from operations in the amount of 2,032,197. The increase in operating cash flow,
in our opinion, is attributed to an increase in net income and an increase in deferred revenue. 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, we had negative cash flows from investing activities in the amount of 227,180. For the year ended
October 31, 2021, we had negative cash flows from investing activities in the amount of 187,123. The decrease in investing cash
flow, in our opinion, is attributed to the purchase of furniture, fixtures and equipment. 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, we had zero cash flows from financing activities. For the year ended October 31, 2021, we had cash
flows from financing activities in the amount of 455. The decrease in financing cash flows, in our opinion, is attributed to the
fact that we had proceeds from due to related party for the year ended October 31, 2021. 

Working Capital 

As
of October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had working capital of 9,697,677 and 3,233,211, respectively. 

Going Concern 

The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company demonstrates some positive trends, compared with the previous
fiscal years, in our financial statements as in below: 

As
of October 31, 2022, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of 5,836,065, an increase of 3,252,847 when compared October
31, 2021 whereas the Company realized cash and cash equivalents of 2,583,218. The Company's major source of liquidity was derived
from the sales of drones and
digital currency mining rigs (cryptocurrency miners). As stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company, for the year
ended on October 31, 2022, recorded a net income of 8,908,782 (+282 
y-o-y) and earned 4,605,591 (+127 
y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. 

Having reviewed the above, the Company realizes that whether we shall be
able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our financial statements, lies in our ability to continue to generate
revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated financial statements are based on going concern assumptions,
which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes
that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s) in the future and procure any required funds needed
to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated impact of COVID-19, which has become
a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will need to continue to monitor as to the
potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal
impact of COVID-19 on the Company s drone sales, which is currently the Company s primary source of revenue. The Company will
need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically, as it is possible that such developments
may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this time, the Company believes that it will
not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation, based on the positive financial trends it has experienced year over year e.g. increase in net income
and increase in net cash provided by operating activities, management believes that it has completely mitigated the circumstances that
led to a doubt with respect to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, i.e. dependency on a single major customer,
which existed at the time of the filing of the Company s prior year report. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the
event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of World Scan Project, Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of World Scan Project, Inc. (the Company) as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended and the related notes
to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

 Revenue Recognition 

 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, when another party is involved in providing goods or services to the Company s clients, a determination is made as to
who is acting in the capacity as the principal in the sales transaction. 

Auditing management s evaluation
of agreements with customers involves significant judgment, given the fact that some agreements require management s evaluation
of principal versus agent. 

To evaluate the appropriateness and
accuracy of the assessment by management, we evaluated management s assessment in relationship to the relevant agreements. 

/s/ 

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

NOTES TO THE
AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 OCTOBER 31, 2022 

Revenue from product sales 

Revenue for products is recognized when the products
are delivered to the customer and the customer completes the product inspection. Cash receipts for undelivered products are recorded
as deferred revenues. As of October 31, 2022, the Company no deferred revenues related to product
sales. 

Revenue
 related party 

During the year
ended October 31, 2022, revenue totaling approximately 7,879 was recognized from sales to related party ZEXAVERSE Corporation (hereinafter
referred to as ZEXAVERSE ). ZEXAVERSE is considered as a related party due to the fact that Ryohei Uetaki, CEO of the Company,
controls the said company. The terms and conditions applied to the above transactions were the same as those applied to sales to
customers not related to the Company. 

Revenue
from crypto miners sales 

During the
year ended October 31, 2022, the Company acted as an agent in facilitating the sales of crypto miners, produced by a third-party
manufacturer, to customers of the Company. Revenue for the sale of crypto miners was recognized when the miners were delivered to
the customers and the customers completed the inspection of the miners. Management assessed the Company s contracts with the
third-party manufacturer and customers in consideration of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and
determined the Company as the agent in said transactions. As such, the company recognized crypto miner sales net of costs. For the
year ended October 31, 2022, Cost of goods sold for minor purchases, netted by the gross sales was 35,580,995 .
 7,401,171 of deferred revenues are related to deposits for crypto miners. 

Revenue
from educational institution program 

Revenue for
educational institution fees is recognized when the services are provided to the customer. Cash receipts for undelivered products are
recorded as deferred revenues. As of October 31, 2022, the Company had no deferred revenues related to the educational institution program.

,
an increase of 3,252,847 compared to in
the prior year ended October 31, 2021, and the Company s major sources of liquidity derived from the sales of drones and
crypto miners. As stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company, for the year ended on October 31, 2022, recorded a
net income of 8,908,782 (+282 y-o-y) and earned 4,605,591 (+127 y-o-y) in
cash flows from operating activities. 

Having reviewed the above, the Company realizes that whether we shall be
able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our financial statements, lies in our ability to continue to generate
revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated financial statements are based on going concern assumptions,
which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes
that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s) in the future and procure any required funds needed
to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated impact of COVID-19, which has become
a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will need to continue to monitor as to the
potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal
impact of COVID-19 on the Company s drone sales, which is currently the Company s primary source of revenue. The Company will
need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically, as it is possible that such developments
may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this time, the Company believes that it will
not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation, based on the positive financial trends it has experienced year over year e.g. increase in net income
and increase in net cash provided by operating activities, management believes that it has completely mitigated the circumstances that
led to a doubt with respect to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, i.e. dependency on a single major customer,
which existed at the time of the filing of the Company s prior year report. 

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

as of October 31, 2022 and as of October 31, 2021. No bad debt allowance was provided as of October
31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. 

Concentration
of Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable
from customers accounting for 10 or more of total accounts receivable are as follows: 

For the year
ended October 31, 2022, 77.36 of total accounts receivable was owed to the Company by Drone Net in the amount of 1,428,976 and 15.36 
of total accounts receivable was owed to the Company by Chabi land in the amount of 283,792. 

.
The Company is depreciating these assets over a 5-10 y ear period once they were put
into use. Depreciation expense for the year ended October 31, 2022 was approximately 50,535. 

During the year
ended October 31, 2021, the Company purchased long-term assets, including a 360 laser scanner, and various tools, furniture and fixtures,
totaling approximately . The Company is depreciating these assets over a five year period once they have been put into use. Depreciation
expense for the year ended October 31, 2021 was approximately 16,136.

and values. As of October 31, 2021, deferred revenue in the amount of was related to our sales of drones.

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The Company regularly assesses the ability
to realize its deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including its earnings history and results
of recent operations, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. 

The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable,
however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective
negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such
as the Company s projections for growth. The adjustments of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater
volatility in the effective tax rate in the periods in which the valuation allowance is adjusted. For the year ended October 31, 2021,
a full valuation allowance was provided. For the year ended October 31, 2022, certain valuation allowance was released for WSP Japan
considering the collectability of deferred tax assets.

Item 9. Changes in and
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under
the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based
on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Office who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures are ineffective. 

Our Chief Executive Officer, Ryohei Uetaki, has reviewed
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by the report October 31, 2022 and has concluded that (i) the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures have
not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management concluded
that, as of October 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is ineffective based on those criteria. 

The Company s management, including its Chief
Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

The matters
involving internal controls and procedures that our Chief Executive Officer considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate
compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, inadequate segregation of duties consistent with
control objectives, lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and report related party transactions, and lack of an audit
committee. 

Management believes
that the material weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning
audit committee and inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management recognizes
that its controls and procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and two individuals serving as officers
and as such is actively seeking to remediate this issue. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives 

In an effort to remediate the identified material
weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We have increased our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise to remediate material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We plan to appoint one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who
will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving
estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management believes that the appointment of one or
more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee
and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We will work as quickly as possible to implement these
initiatives; however, the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There have been no changes in internal controls over
the financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC
that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Due to Mr. Ichikawa s technological experience,

Ethics 

The Company promotes accountability for adherence
to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public communications made by the
Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a
written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company's employees, officers and directors as the Company is not required
to do so. 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company's board
of director(s) (the Board of Directors or Board ), is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements
and other services provided by the Company's independent public accountants. The Board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company's internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees of the Board 

Our Company currently does not have nominating, compensation,
or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee
charter. Our sole director believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the director(s) can adequately
perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our director has determined that we do not have a
board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do
we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules. 

We believe that
our director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for
financial reporting. The director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management
believes that the Board of directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining
an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date.

Our officers
and sole director have not been involved in or a party in any of the following events or actions during the past ten years:

Independence
of Directors 

We are not required
to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such time as we are required
to do so. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not
adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Director(s) evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined
that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business
conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future,
we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our Company
does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The
Board of Director(s) believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Director(s) will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A shareholder
who wishes to communicate with our Board of Director(s) may do so by directing a written request addressed to our sole Director Ryohei
Uetaki, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Company s common stock. Such officers, directors and persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies
of all Section 16(a) forms that they file with the SEC. 

Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms
that were received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those persons,
the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports or report transactions in a timely manner during the Company s fiscal year
ended October 31, 2022. 

Procedure for Nominating Directors

executive officers or persons nominated to become executive officers or directors.

in Item 401 (f) of Regulation S-K. 

Arrangements

shall be in the sole determination of the Board of Directors. 

Executive Compensation Philosophy 

Our Board of Directors determines the compensation

bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s performance. This package may also
include long-term stock based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance of our executives with our
long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance base stock options to date,
the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination believes such grants
would be in the best interests of the Company. 

Incentive Bonus 

The Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses
to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the Board of Directors believes such bonuses are
in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we
are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability of such executives. 

Long-term, Stock Based Compensation 

In order to attract, retain and motivate executive
talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award our executive and any future executives with

Our Series A Preferred Stock currently has no voting
rights. Currently we have 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding of which Ryohei Uetaki owns and controls
through his exclusive membership interest in SKYPR LLC. 

(1) Ryohei Uetaki currently serves as our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. Ryohei Uetaki owns 100 of the membership interests in
SKYPR LLC., a Delaware Limited Liability Company, which owns 7,000,000 shares of our common stock and 10,000,000 shares of our Series
A Preferred Stock. The table above includes the share ownership of SKYPR LLC with Ryohei Uetaki collectively, in the row for Mr. Uetaki. 

Beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance
with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person
(if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially
owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of
the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed
to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of
outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual voting power at
any particular date. 

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 

On October 25, 2019 the Company issued 10,000,000
shares of restricted Common Stock to Ryohei Uetaki for services rendered to the Company. Additionally, on the same day, it issued 10,000,000
shares of its restricted Series A Preferred Stock to Ryohei Uetaki, also for services rendered. The aforementioned shares of common and
preferred stock were all issued at par value, 0.0001, having a total value of 2,000. No monies were exchanged per the issuances and
the shares were all exempt from the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act under Section 4(2) of such same said act. 

On January 25, 2020, the Company entered into and
consummated a Share Contribution Agreement with Ryohei Uetaki. Pursuant to this agreement Mr. Uetaki gifted to the Company, at no cost,
300 shares of common stock of World Scan Project Corporation, a Japan corporation WSP Japan ), which represented all of
its issued and outstanding shares. The Company has since gained a 100 interest in the issued and outstanding shares of WSP Japan s
common stock and WSP Japan is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and WSP Japan were under common control at the
time of the acquisition. WSP Japan was incorporated under the laws of Japan on January 22, 2020. Currently, WSP Japan is headquartered
in Tokyo, Japan. The Company is an industrial automation equipment manufacturer currently focused on developing and designing robots,
drones, Web3 infrastructure, IoT equipment and other related products. 

On February 19, 2020, Ryohei Uetaki gifted 7,000,000
shares of our Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which represented all of our issued and outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock at the time, to SKYPR LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (referred to herein as SKYPR LLC ).
Our CEO Ryohei Uetaki owns and controls 100 of the membership interests in SKYPR LLC. 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, the Company borrowed 0 from Ryohei Uetaki, our CEO. The total due was 18,517 for salary and 458
for expenses as of October 31, 2022, and 455 for expenses as of October 31, 2021, and were unsecured, due on demand and
non-interest bearing. 

Aiming to establish a new revenue source, the Company
planned to enter a new business, create avatars which offer exploring opportunities in metaverse. Found less feasible to realize reasonable
revenue, the Company gave up the idea and related assets were transferred to ZEXAVERSE before the Company put those in service. 

For the said transaction, the Company and ZEXAVERSE
entered into a memorandum on July 1, 2022 and assets were all transferred to ZEXAVERSE on July 15, 2022. However, the Company was the
contracting party with the vendors in sourcing assets for the new business, the Company invoiced the sum of contract value with vendors
to ZEXAVERSE upon the said transfer in the amount of 727,911. The amount we disbursed to the vendors and the amount the company invoiced
to ZEXAVERSE was paid on October 31, 2022. There is no revenue/loss, inventory, cost of goods sold occurred to the Company in relation
to this transaction. 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, revenue totaling 7,879 was recognized from sales to related party ZEXAVERSE Corporation (hereinafter
referred to as ZEXAVERSE ). ZEXAVERSE is considered as a related party due to the fact that Ryohei Uetaki, our CEO, controls
the said company. For the year ended October 31, 2021, there was no sales to related party. 

The terms and conditions applied to the above transactions
were the same as those applied to sales to customers not related to the Company. 

Review, Approval
and Ratification of Related Party Transactions 

Given our small
size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of transactions,
such as those described above, with our executive officer(s), Director(s) and significant shareholders. We intend to establish formal
policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional Directors, so that such transactions
will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee thereof. On a moving forward
basis, our directors will continue to approve any related party transaction.
