 ATTESTATION REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
Board of Directors 

 U.S.
Bank National Association 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Repackaging Platform
(the Platform ), for which the Company provides servicing functions for publicly issued transactions comprised of
the repackaging of corporate debt and/or other agency securities, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing
criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(1)(iii)-(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii)
and 1122(d)(4)(ix)-(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the
servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company
during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Repackaging Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
