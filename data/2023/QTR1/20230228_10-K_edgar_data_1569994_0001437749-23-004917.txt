Competition 
 
 WaterStone Bank . WaterStone Bank faces competition within our market area both in making real estate loans and attracting deposits. The Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan statistical area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large commercial banks, community banks and credit unions.

Waterstone Mortgage Corporation s competition comes principally from other mortgage banking firms, as well as from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.

One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans. One- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled 469.6 million, or 31.1 of total loans at December 31, 2022. Our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans have fixed or adjustable rates. Our single family adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally provide for maximum annual rate adjustments of 200 basis points, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 600 basis points. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans typically amortize over terms of up to 30 years, and are indexed to either the 12-month SOFR rate or the 12-month LIBOR. Single family adjustable rate mortgage loans are originated at both our community banking segment and our mortgage banking segment. We do not offer and have never offered residential mortgage loans specifically designed for borrowers with sub-prime credit scores, including Alt-A and negative amortization loans. 
 
 Adjustable rate mortgage loans can decrease the interest rate risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because, as interest rates increase, the loan payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents and, therefore, the effectiveness of adjustable rate mortgage loans in decreasing the risk associated with changes in interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. Moreover, during periods of rapidly declining interest rates the interest income received from the adjustable rate loans can be significantly reduced, thereby adversely affecting interest income.

All residential mortgage loans that we originate include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise transfers the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. We also require homeowner s insurance and where circumstances warrant, flood insurance, on properties securing real estate loans. The average one- to four-family first mortgage loan balance was approximately 276,000 on December 31, 2022, and the largest outstanding balance on that date was 5.9 million, which is a consolidation loan that is collateralized by 86 single family properties. A total of 37.1 of our one- to four-family loans are collateralized by properties in the state of Wisconsin. 
 
 Multi-family Real Estate Loans. Multi-family loans totaled 678.0 million, or 44.9 of total loans at December 31, 2022. These loans are generally secured by properties located in our primary market area. Our multi-family real estate underwriting policies generally provide that such real estate loans may be made in amounts of up to 80 of the appraised value of the property provided the loan complies with our current loans-to-one borrower limit. Multi-family real estate loans are offered with interest rates that are fixed for periods of up to five years or are variable and either adjust based on a market index or at our discretion. Contractual maturities do not exceed 10 years while principal and interest payments are typically based on a 30-year amortization period. In reaching a decision whether to make a multi-family real estate loan, we consider gross revenues and the net operating income of the property, the borrower s expertise and credit history, global cash flows, and the appraised value of the underlying property. We will also consider the terms and conditions of the leases and the credit quality of the tenants. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense and current maturities of long term debt) of at least 1.15 times. Generally, multi-family loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees from the principals and by the owners of 20 or more of the borrower. 
 
 A multi-family borrower s financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. We generally require borrowers with aggregate outstanding balances exceeding 1.0 million to provide updated financial statements and federal tax returns annually. These requirements also apply to most guarantors on these loans. We also require borrowers with rental investment property to provide an annual report of income and expenses for the property, including a tenant list and copies of leases, as applicable. The average outstanding multi-family mortgage loan balance was approximately 1.4 million on December 31, 2022, with the largest outstanding balance at 16.7 million. 
 
 Loans secured by multi-family real estate generally involve larger principal amounts than owner-occupied, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family properties often depend on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. 
 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit . We also offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2022, outstanding home equity loans and equity lines of credit totaled 11.5 million, or 0.8 of total loans outstanding. At December 31, 2022, the unadvanced portion of home equity lines of credit totaled 9.5 million. The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant s credit history, an assessment of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Home equity loans are offered with adjustable rates of interest and with terms up to seven years. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and our lines of credit is generally limited to 90 when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. Our home equity lines of credit have ten-year terms and adjustable rates of interest, subject to a contractual floor, which are indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal . Interest rates on home equity lines of credit are generally limited to a maximum rate of 18 . The average outstanding home equity loan balance was approximately 47,000 at December 31, 2022, with the largest outstanding balance at that date of 334,000. 
 
 Construction and Land Loans. We originate construction loans for the acquisition of land and the construction of single-family residences, multi-family residences, and commercial real estate buildings. At December 31, 2022, construction and land loans totaled 62.5 million, or 4.1 of total loans. A total of 48.5 million had yet to be advanced as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Our construction mortgage loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to nine months for single-family residences although our policy is to consider construction periods as long as three years for multi-family residences and commercial buildings. At the end of the construction phase, the construction loan converts to a longer-term mortgage loan upon stabilization. Construction loans can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90 , provided that the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance if the owner-occupied residential loan balance exceeds 80 of the lesser of the appraised value or acquisition cost of the secured property. The average outstanding construction loan balance totaled approximately 4.3 million on December 31, 2022, with the largest outstanding balance at 15.3 million. The average outstanding land loan balance was approximately 169,000 on December 31, 2022, and the largest outstanding balance on that date was 604,000. 
 
 Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on either the percentage of completion method or the actual cost of the completed work. 
 
 Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Additionally, if the estimate of value is inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, with a value that is insufficient to ensure full repayment of the loan.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans totaled 263.0 million at December 31, 2022, or 17.4 of total loans, and are made up of loans secured by office and retail buildings, industrial buildings, churches, restaurants, other retail properties and mixed use properties. These loans are generally secured by property located in our primary market area. Our commercial real estate underwriting policies provide that such real estate loans may be made in amounts of up to 80 of the appraised value of the property. Commercial real estate loans are offered with interest rates that are fixed up to five years or are variable and either adjust based on a market index or at our discretion. Contractual maturities do not exceed 10 years while principal and interest payments are typically based on a 20 to 25-year amortization period. In reaching a decision whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider gross revenues and the net operating income of the property, the borrower s expertise and credit history, business and global cash flow, and the appraised value of the underlying property. In addition, we will also consider the terms and conditions of the leases and the credit quality of the tenants, if applicable. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense and current maturities of long term debt) of at least 1.15 times. Environmental surveys are required for commercial real estate loans when environmental risks are identified. Generally, commercial real estate loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees by the principals and by the owners of 20 or more of the borrower. 
 
 A commercial real estate borrower s financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. We generally require borrowers with aggregate outstanding balances exceeding 1.0 million to provide annual updated financial statements and federal tax returns. These requirements also apply to all guarantors on these loans. We also require borrowers to provide an annual report of income and expenses for the property, including a tenant list and copies of leases, as applicable. The average commercial real estate loan in our portfolio at December 31, 2022 was approximately 960,000, and the largest outstanding balance at that date was 16.1 million. 
 
 Commercial Loans. Commercial loans totaled 24.9 million at December 31, 2022, or 1.7 of total loans, and are made up of loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. 
 
 Our commercial loans are generally made to borrowers that are located in our primary market area. Working capital lines of credit are granted for the purpose of carrying inventory and accounts receivable or purchasing equipment. These lines require that certain collateral levels must be maintained and are monitored on a monthly or quarterly basis. Working capital lines of credit are short-term loans of 12 months or less with variable interest rates. At December 31, 2022, the unadvanced portion of working capital lines of credit totaled 17.4 million. Outstanding balances fluctuate up to the maximum commitment amount based on fluctuations in the balance of the underlying collateral. Personal property loans secured by equipment are considered commercial business loans and are generally made for terms of up to 84 months and for up to 80 of the value of the underlying collateral. Interest rates on equipment loans may be either fixed or variable. Commercial business loans are generally variable rate loans with initial fixed rate periods of up to five years. 
 
 A commercial business borrower s financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, usually quarterly, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. The average outstanding commercial loan at December 31, 2022 was 367,000 and the largest outstanding balance on that date was 7.1 million. 
 
 Origination and Servicing of Loans. All loans originated for investment are underwritten pursuant to internally developed policies and procedures. While we generally underwrite owner-occupied residential mortgage loans to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards, due to several unique characteristics, our loans originated prior to 2008 do not conform to the secondary market standards. The unique features of these loans include interest payments in advance of the month in which they are earned and discretionary rate adjustments that are not tied to an independent index. 
 
 Exclusive of our mortgage banking operations, we retain in our portfolio all of the loans that we originate. At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank was not servicing any loan it originated and subsequently sold to unrelated third parties. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . WaterStone Bank s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by WaterStone Bank s board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan, if applicable. To assess the borrower s ability to repay, we review the employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of borrowers. Loan officers, with concurrence from independent credit officers and underwriters, are authorized to approve and close any loan that qualifies under WaterStone Bank underwriting guidelines within the following lending limits: 

Any secured mortgage loan up to 500,000 for a borrower with total outstanding loans from us of less than 1.0 million that is independently underwritten can be approved by the Chief Credit Officer or select lending personnel. 

Any secured mortgage loan up to 1.0 million can be approved jointly the Chief Executive Officer. 

Any secured mortgage loan ranging from 500,001 to 3.0 million or any new loan to a borrower with outstanding loans from us exceeding 1.0 million must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee. 

Any non-real estate loan up to 250,000 for a borrower with total outstanding loans from us of less than 250,000 that is independently underwritten can be approved by select lending personnel. 

Any non-real estate loan up to 500,000 for a borrower with total outstanding loans from us of less than 500,000 that is independently underwritten can be approved by the Chief Executive Officer or Business Banking Manager. 

Any non-real estate loan ranging from 500,001 to 3.0 million or any new non-real estate loan to a borrower with outstanding loans exceeding 500,000 must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee. 

Any new loan over 3.0 million must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee and the board of directors prior to closing. Any new loan to a borrower with outstanding loans from us exceeding 10.0 million must be reviewed by the board of directors. 

Asset Quality 
 
 When a loan becomes more than 30 days delinquent, WaterStone Bank sends a letter advising the borrower of the delinquency. The borrower is given a specific date by which delinquent payments must be made or by which they must contact WaterStone Bank to make arrangements to bring the loan current over a longer period of time. If the borrower fails to bring the loan current within the specified time period or to make arrangements to cure the delinquency over a longer period of time, the matter is referred to legal counsel and foreclosure or other collection proceedings are considered. 
 
 All loans are reviewed on a regular basis, and loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 or more days delinquent. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received when collection of the remaining principal balance is reasonably assured. 
 
 Non-Performing Assets. Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans and other real estate owned. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, management may place such loans on non-accrual status immediately, rather than waiting until the loan becomes 90 days past due. At the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed and additional income is recorded only to the extent that payments are received and the collection of principal is reasonably assured. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

All loans that meet or exceed 90 days with respect to past due principal and interest are recognized as non-accrual. Troubled debt restructurings which are still on non-accrual status either due to being past due 90 days or greater, or which have not yet performed under the modified terms for a reasonable period of time, are included in the table above. In addition, loans which are past due less than 90 days are evaluated to determine the likelihood of collectability given other credit risk factors such as early stage delinquency, the nature of the collateral or the results of a borrower fiscal review. When the collection of all contractual principal and interest is determined to be unlikely, the loan is moved to non-accrual status and an updated appraisal of the underlying collateral is ordered. This process generally takes place between 60 and 90 days past contractual due dates. Upon determining the updated estimated value of the collateral, a loan loss provision is recorded to establish a specific reserve to the extent that the outstanding principal balance exceeds the updated estimated net realizable value of the collateral. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible, generally coinciding with the initiation of foreclosure action, the specific reserve is reviewed for adequacy, adjusted if necessary, and charged-off.

Total non-accrual loans decreased by 1.3 million to 4.3 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to 5.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans receivable was 0.29 at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.46 at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no loans were transferred to real estate owned or were charged off, 3.2 million in principal payments were received and 1.4 million in loans were returned to accrual status. Offsetting this activity, 3.3 million in loans were placed on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Of the 4.3 million in total non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2022, 2.6 million in loans have been specifically reviewed to assess whether a specific valuation allowance is necessary. A specific valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying value of the loan exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral with an adjustment made for costs to dispose of the asset. Based upon these specific reviews, a total of 30,000 in partial charge-offs have been recorded with respect to these loans as of December 31, 2022. Partially charged-off loans measured for impairment based upon net realizable collateral value are maintained in a non-performing status and are disclosed as impaired loans. There were no specific reserve as of December 31, 2022. The remaining 1.7 million of non-accrual loans were reviewed on an aggregate basis as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The outstanding principal balance of our five largest non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2022 totaled 2.4 million, which represents 55.7 of total non-accrual loans as of that date. These five loans did not have any charge-offs or require any specific valuation allowances as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Interest payments received are treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining book value of the loan (i.e., after charge-off of all identified losses) is deemed to be fully collectible. If the remaining book value is not deemed to be fully collectible, all payments received are applied to unpaid principal. Determination as to the ultimate collectability of the remaining book value is supported by an updated credit department evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors. 
 
 There were no accruing loans past due 90 days or more during the years ended December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

Troubled debt restructurings totaled 936,000 at December 31, 2022, compared to 4.0 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, all of the troubled debt restructurings were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. All troubled debt restructurings are considered to be impaired and are risk rated as either substandard or watch and are included in the internal risk rating tables disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Specific reserves have been established to the extent that the collateral-based impairment analyses indicate that a collateral shortfall exists or to the extent that a discounted cash flow analysis results in an impairment. 
 
 Our troubled debt restructurings are short-term modifications. Typical initial restructured terms include six to twelve months of principal forbearance, a reduction in interest rate or both. Restructured terms do not include a reduction of the outstanding principal balance unless mandated by a bankruptcy court. Troubled debt restructuring terms may be renewed or further modified at the end of the initial term for an additional period if performance has been acceptable and the short-term borrower difficulty persists.

Interest payments received on non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining book value of the loan (i.e., after charge-off of all identified losses) is deemed to be fully collectible. If the remaining book value is not deemed to be fully collectible, all payments received are applied to unpaid principal. Determination as to the ultimate collectability of the remaining book value is supported by an updated credit department evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors. 
 
 If a restructured loan is current in all respects and a minimum of six consecutive restructured payments have been received, it can be considered for return to accrual status. After a restructured loan that is current in all respects reverts to contractual/market terms, if a credit department review indicates no evidence of elevated market risk, the loan is removed from the troubled debt restructuring classification. The restructured loan will be classified as a troubled debt restructuring for at least the calendar year after the modification even after returning to a contractual/market rate and accrual status.

Loans past due less than 90 days decreased by 116,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in one- to four-family loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased 685,000. The decrease in loans past due 90 days or more was primarily due to a decrease in the one-to four-family loans during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Potential Problem Loans. We define potential problem loans as substandard loans which are still accruing interest. We do not necessarily expect to realize losses on potential problem loans, but we recognize potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management. The aggregate principal amounts of potential problem loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 5.5 million and 7.9 million, respectively. Management believes it has established an adequate allowance for probable loan losses as appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Real Estate Owned. Total real estate owned was 145,000 at December 31, 2022, and 148,000 at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was no significant activity. 
 
 New appraisals received on real estate owned and collateral dependent impaired loans are based upon an "as is value" assumption. During the period of time in which we are awaiting receipt of an updated appraisal, loans evaluated for impairment based upon collateral value are measured by the following: 

Applying an updated adjustment factor to an existing appraisal; 

Confirming that the physical condition of the real estate has not significantly changed since the last valuation date; 

Comparing the estimated current value of the collateral to that of updated sales values experienced on similar collateral; 

Comparing the estimated current value of the collateral to that of updated values seen on current appraisals of similar collateral; and 

Comparing the estimated current value to that of updated listed sales prices on our real estate owned and that of similar properties (not owned by the Company). 

We owned one property at December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. Habitable real estate owned is managed with the intent of attracting a lessee to generate revenue. Foreclosed properties are transferred to real estate owned at estimated net realizable value, with charge-offs, if any, charged to the allowance for loan losses upon transfer to real estate owned. The fair value is primarily based upon updated appraisals in addition to an analysis of current real estate market conditions.

(1) The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2022. The prior year amounts presented are calculated under the prior accounting standard. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses - loans increased 2.0 million to 17.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 15.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase resulted from the CECL model adoption on January 1, 2022 along with loan growth throughout the year. The CECL calculation resulted in an opening balance adjustment of 430,000 to increase the allowance for credit losses along with a 1.0 million provision for credit losses - loans during the during year. Additionally, net recoveries totaled 519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. With the adoption of CECL, estimated recoveries may be accounted for within the calculation and do not impact the provision for credit losses line item when cash is received. 
 
 We had net recoveries of 519,000, or 0.04 of average loans annualized, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net recoveries of 945,000 or 0.07 of average loans annualized, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the 519,000 in net recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2022, the majority of the activity related to loans secured by multi-family loan categories. 
 
 Our underwriting policies and procedures emphasize that credit decisions must rely on both the credit quality of the borrower and the estimated value of the underlying collateral. Credit quality is assured only when the estimated value of the collateral is objectively determined and is not subject to significant fluctuation. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses - loans has been determined in accordance with GAAP. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. Any future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral, trends in non-performing loans, current economic conditions and other relevant factors.

The establishment of the amount of the credit loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the appropriateness of the allowance, which ultimately may or may not be correct. Higher than anticipated rates of loan default would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses - loans was 17.8 million, compared to 15.8 million at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses to total loans receivable was 1.18 and 412.28 of non-performing loans, compared to 1.31 , and 283.06 , respectively at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects an improvement in certain economic factors, decreasing the required allowance related to the loans collectively reviewed. The overall decrease was related to each of the one- to four-family, multi family, home equity, construction and land, commercial real estate, consumer, and commercial categories. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the allowance for credit losses - loans. 
 
 Mortgage Banking Activity 
 
 In addition to the lending activities previously discussed, we also originate single-family residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market through Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation originated, including loans sold to WaterStone Bank, 2.76 billion in mortgage loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was a volume decrease of 1.47 billion, or 34.6 , from the 4.23 billion originated during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in loan production volume was driven by a 986.3 million, or 76.6 , decrease in refinance products as mortgage rates increased from the prior year. Mortgage purchase products decreased 478.8 million, or 16.3 , due to an increase in mortgage rates year-over-year and the decline in affordable housing inventories. Total mortgage banking income decreased 93.5 million, or 47.3 , to 104.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 197.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in mortgage banking noninterest income was related to a 34.6 decrease in volume and an 18.3 decrease in gross margin on loans originated and sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Gross margin on those loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. We sell loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing retained basis. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which we retain servicing. 
 
 Our gross margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or U.S. Department of Agriculture loan. Loans originated for the purchase of a residential property, which generally yield a higher margin than loans originated for refinancing existing loans, comprised 89.1 of total originations during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 69.5 of total originations during the year ended December 31, 2021. The mix of loan type trended towards more governmental loans and less conventional loans comprising 29.3 and 70.7 of all loan originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 23.4 and 76.6 of all loan originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Investment Activities 
 
 Wauwatosa Investments, Inc. is WaterStone Bank s investment subsidiary headquartered in the State of Nevada. Wauwatosa Investments, Inc. manages the back office function for WaterStone Bank s investment portfolio. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasury Officer are responsible for executing purchases and sales in accordance with our investment policy and monitoring the investment activities of Wauwatosa Investments, Inc. The investment policy is reviewed annually by management and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of WaterStone Bank's board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated by the board to designated employees. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by management, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer and Treasury Officer who may act jointly in performing security trades. The Chief Financial Officer and Treasury Officer are responsible for ensuring that the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and that all securities are considered prudent for investment. The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasury Officer are authorized to execute investment transactions (purchases and sales) without the prior approval of the board provided they are within the scope of the established investment policy. 
 
 Our investment policy requires that all securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Investment decisions are based upon a thorough analysis of each security instrument to determine its quality, inherent risks, fit within our overall asset/liability management objectives, effect on our risk-based capital measurement and prospects for yield and/or appreciation. 
 
 Consistent with our overall business and asset/liability management strategy, which focuses on sustaining adequate levels of core earnings, our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities that are classified as available for sale. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, no investment securities were sold.

Available for Sale Portfolio 
 
 Mortgage-backed Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. We purchase mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and private-label mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk. We regularly monitor the credit quality of this portfolio. 
 
 Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and private-label mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security. These securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage related securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as WaterStone Bank, and in the case of government agency sponsored issues, guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and private-label mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees, if any, and credit enhancements. These fixed-rate securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, mortgage-backed securities totaled 13.3 million. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.48 and a weighted average remaining life of 9.7 years at December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 1.8 million less than the amortized cost of 15.1 million. Mortgage-backed securities valued at 259,000 were pledged as collateral for mortgage banking activities as of December 31, 2022. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment, particularly since all of our mortgage-backed securities have a fixed rate of interest. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, collateralized mortgage obligations totaled 124.8 million. At December 31, 2022, the collateralized mortgage obligations portfolio consisted entirely of securities backed by government sponsored enterprises or U.S. Government agencies. The collateralized mortgage obligations portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.06 and a weighted average remaining life of 6.0 years at December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of our collateralized mortgage obligations portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 21.0 million less than the amortized cost of 145.7 million. Investments in collateralized mortgage obligations involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment, particularly since all of our collateralized mortgage obligations have a fixed rate of interest. 
 
 Private-Label Mortgage-backed Securities. At December 31, 2022, private-label mortgage-backed securities totaled 8.1 million. These securities had a weighted average yield of 3.61 and a weighted average remaining life of 5.3 years at December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of our private-label mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 935,000 less than the amortized cost of 9.0 million. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment, particularly since all of our mortgage-backed securities have a fixed rate of interest. 
 
 Government Sponsored Enterprise Bonds. At December 31, 2022, our Government sponsored enterprise bond portfolio totaled 2.3 million, all of which were issued by Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and were classified as available for sale. The weighted average yield on these securities was 0.60 and the weighted average remaining average life was 2.6 years at December 31, 2022. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes and prepayment protection. The estimated fair value of our government sponsored enterprise bond portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 244,000 less than the amortized cost of 2.5 million. 
 
 Municipal Obligations. These securities consist of obligations issued by school districts, counties and municipalities or their agencies and include general obligation bonds, industrial development revenue bonds and other revenue bonds. Our investment policy requires that such municipal obligations be rated A+ or better by a nationally recognized rating agency at the date of purchase. A security that is downgraded below investment grade will require additional analysis of creditworthiness and a determination will be made to hold or dispose of the investment. We regularly monitor the credit quality of this portfolio. At December 31, 2022, our municipal obligations portfolio totaled 36.9 million, all of which was classified as available for sale. The weighted average yield on this portfolio was 3.94 at December 31, 2022, with a weighted average remaining life of 6.8 years. The estimated fair value of our municipal obligations bond portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 765,000 less than the amortized cost of 37.7 million.

Other Debt Securities. As of December 31, 2022, we held other debt securities in the portfolio that totaled 11.2 million. Other debt securities consists of two corporate bonds. The weighted average yield on this portfolio was 3.43 at December 31, 2022, with a weighted average remaining life of 7.3 years. We regularly monitor the credit quality of this portfolio. The unrealized losses for the other debt securities is due to the current slope of the yield curve. One security earns a floating rate that is indexed to the 10 year Treasury interest rate. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, no allowance for credit losses on securities was recognized. The Company does not consider its securities with unrealized losses to be attributable to credit-related factors, as the unrealized losses in each category have occurred as a result of changes in noncredit-related factors such as changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase, not credit deterioration. Furthermore, the Company does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. 
 
 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates and do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur. Municipal obligation yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. Certain mortgage related securities have interest rates that are adjustable and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below.

Sources of Funds 
 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also rely on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and borrowings from other commercial banks in the form of repurchase agreements collateralized by investment securities. In addition to deposits and borrowings, we derive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, economic conditions and competition from other financial institutions. 
 
 Deposits. A majority of our depositors are persons or businesses who work, reside, or are located in Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties and, to a lesser extent, other southeastern Wisconsin communities. We offer a selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and fixed-term certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. As of December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit comprised 53.6 of total customer deposits, and had a weighted average cost of 1.52 on that date. Our reliance on certificates of deposit has resulted in a higher cost of funds than would otherwise be the case if demand deposits, savings and money market accounts made up a larger part of our deposit base. Development of our branch network and expansion of our commercial products and services and aggressively seeking lower cost savings, checking and money market accounts are expected to result in decreased reliance on higher-cost certificates of deposit. 
 
 Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. To attract and retain deposits, we rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships and competitive interest rates. We also provide remote deposit capture, internet banking and mobile banking. 
 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on historical experience, management believes our deposits are relatively stable. The ability to attract and maintain money market accounts and certificates of deposit, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 642.3 million and 626.7 million of our deposit accounts were certificates of deposit, of which 502.3 million and 533.0 million, respectively, had remaining maturities of one year or less. 
 
 Deposits decreased by 34.4 million, or 2.8 , from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The decrease in deposits was the result of a 50.0 million, or 8.2 , decrease in total transaction accounts offset by a 15.6 million, or 2.5 increase in time deposits. The Company had no deposits obtained directly from brokers as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Human Capital 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 742 full-time equivalent employees. A total of 172 are WaterStone Bank employees and 570 are employees of Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. We believe we are able to attract and retain top talent by creating a culture that challenges and engages our employees, offering them opportunities to learn, grow and achieve their career goals. Further, our commitment to a culture of inclusion is integral to our goal of attracting and retaining the best talent and ultimately driving our business performance. Our Diversity and Inclusion strategy includes regular training and development for all employees and partnerships with non-profit organizations that share in our inclusion mission. Our employees participate in a wide array of volunteer activities and we support their charitable giving by matching employee contributions to qualified nonprofit organizations. 
 
 We offer comprehensive compensation and benefits packages to our employees including a 401k Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off and certain family assistance programs, including paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, amongst others. We also offer stock-based compensation to certain management personnel as a way to attract and retain key talent. See Note 10 - Stock Based Compensation, Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans, and Note 12 - Employee Stock Ownership Plan to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion of our stock-based compensation and benefit plans. 
 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 
 General 
 
 WaterStone Bank is a stock savings bank organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin. The lending, investment, and other business operations of WaterStone Bank are governed by Wisconsin law and regulations, as well as applicable federal law and regulations, and WaterStone Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not authorized by such laws and regulations. WaterStone Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the WDFI and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. WaterStone Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. WaterStone Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 
 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as WaterStone Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
 
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network. 
 
 As a savings and loan holding company, Waterstone Financial is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Waterstone Financial is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the WDFI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Waterstone Financial, WaterStone Bank and Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. 
 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to WaterStone Bank, Waterstone Mortgage Corporation and Waterstone Financial. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on WaterStone Bank, Waterstone Mortgage Corporation and Waterstone Financial.

Table of Contents 

Intrastate and Interstate Merger and Branching Activities 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Any Wisconsin savings bank meeting certain requirements may, upon approval of the WDFI, establish one or more branch offices in the state of Wisconsin and the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio. In addition, upon WDFI approval, a Wisconsin savings bank may establish a branch office in any other state as the result of a merger or consolidation. 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation . Federal law permits the federal banking agencies to, under certain circumstances, approve acquisition transactions between banks located in different states, regardless of whether an acquisition would be prohibited under state law. Federal law also authorizes de novo branching into another state at locations at which banks chartered by the host state could establish a branch. 
 
 Loans and Investments 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulations. Under Wisconsin law and regulation, WaterStone Bank is authorized to make, invest in, sell, purchase, participate or otherwise deal in mortgage loans or interests in mortgage loans without geographic restriction, including loans made on the security of residential and commercial property. Wisconsin savings banks also may lend funds on a secured or unsecured basis for business, commercial or agricultural purposes, provided the total of all such loans does not exceed 20 of the savings bank s total assets, unless the WDFI authorizes a greater amount. Loans are subject to certain other limitations, including percentage restrictions based on total assets. 
 
 Wisconsin savings banks may invest funds in certain types of debt and equity securities, including obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies. Subject to prior approval of the WDFI, compliance with capital requirements and certain other restrictions, Wisconsin savings banks may invest in residential housing development projects. Wisconsin savings banks may also invest in service corporations or subsidiaries with the prior approval of the WDFI, subject to certain restrictions. Similarly, the line of credit that WaterStone Bank provides to Waterstone Mortgage Corporation is subject to the approval of the WDFI. 
 
 Wisconsin savings banks may make loans and extensions of credit, both direct and indirect, to one borrower in amounts up to 20 of the savings bank s capital plus an additional 5 for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. In addition, and notwithstanding the 20 of capital and additional 5 of capital limitations set forth above, Wisconsin savings banks may make loans to one borrower, or a related group of borrowers, for any purpose in an amount not to exceed 500,000, or to develop domestic residential housing units in an amount not to exceed the lesser of 30 million or 30 of the savings bank s capital, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank did not have any loans which exceeded the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 
 In addition, under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank must qualify for and maintain a level of qualified thrift investments equal to 60 of its assets as prescribed in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A Wisconsin savings bank that fails to meet this qualified thrift lender test becomes subject to certain operating restrictions otherwise applicable only to commercial banks. At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank maintained 84.2 of its assets in qualified thrift investments and therefore met the qualified thrift lender requirement. 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation . Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations also govern the equity investments of WaterStone Bank and, notwithstanding Wisconsin law and regulations, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations prohibit WaterStone Bank from making certain equity investments and generally limit WaterStone Bank s equity investments to those that are permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries. Under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, WaterStone Bank must obtain prior Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval before directly, or indirectly through a majority-owned subsidiary, engaging as principal in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless certain exceptions apply. The activity regulations provide that state banks that meet applicable minimum capital requirements would be permitted to engage in certain activities that are not permissible for national banks, including certain real estate and securities activities conducted through subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will not approve an activity that it determines presents a significant risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance fund. The current activities of WaterStone Bank and its subsidiaries are permissible under applicable federal regulations. 
 
 Loans to, and other transactions with, affiliates of WaterStone Bank, such as Waterstone Financial, are restricted by the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder. See Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders below. 
 
 Lending Standards 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank is permitted to establish deposit accounts and accept deposits. WaterStone Bank s board of directors, or its designee, determine the rate and amount of interest to be paid on or credited to deposit accounts. 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation . The federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate. Under the joint regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies, all insured depository institutions, such as WaterStone Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and loan documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators. 

- 20 -

Table of Contents 

The Interagency Guidelines, among other things, require a depository institution to establish internal loan-to-value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of the following supervisory limits: 

for loans secured by raw land, the supervisory loan-to-value limit is 65 of the value of the collateral; 

for land development loans (i.e., loans for the purpose of improving unimproved property prior to the erection of structures), the supervisory limit is 75 ; 

for loans for the construction of commercial, over four-family or other non-residential property, the supervisory limit is 80 ; 

for loans for the construction of one- to four-family properties, the supervisory limit is 85 ; and 

for loans secured by other improved property (e.g., farmland, completed commercial property and other income-producing property, including non-owner occupied, one- to four-family property), the limit is 85 . 

Although no supervisory loan-to-value limit has been established for permanent mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family and home equity loans, the Interagency Guidelines state that for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90 at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank is permitted to establish deposit accounts and accept deposits. WaterStone Bank s board of directors, or its designee, determines the rate and amount of interest to be paid on or credited to deposit accounts subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limitations. 
 
 Deposit Insurance 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank is required to obtain and maintain insurance on its deposits from a deposit insurance corporation. The deposits of WaterStone Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation. WaterStone Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, generally up to a maximum of 250,000. 
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes an assessment against all insured depository institutions. An institution s assessment rate depends upon the perceived risk of the institution to the Deposit Insurance Fund, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Currently, assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of total assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical models estimating the probability of failure within three years. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of WaterStone Bank s size range from 2.5 to 42 basis points of an institution s total assets less tangible capital. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking. 
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of WaterStone Bank. We cannot predict what deposit insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Capitalization 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation . Wisconsin savings banks are required to maintain a minimum capital to total assets ratio of 6 and must maintain total capital necessary to ensure the continuation of insurance of deposit accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If the WDFI determines that the financial condition, history, management or earning prospects of a savings bank are not adequate, the WDFI may require a higher minimum capital level for the savings bank. If a Wisconsin savings bank s capital ratio falls below the required level, the WDFI may direct the savings bank to adhere to a specific written plan established by the WDFI to correct the savings bank s capital deficiency, as well as a number of other restrictions on the savings bank s operations, including a prohibition on the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank s capital to assets ratio, as calculated under Wisconsin law, was 15.90 . 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation . Federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 
 Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). WaterStone Bank exercised its AOCI opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 
 In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, including the bank s exposure to interest rate risk. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary due to a determination that an institution s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of particular circumstances. 
 
 Legislation enacted in May required the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 to 10 of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework are deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio on its quarterly call report. 
 
 The optional community bank leverage ratio has currently been established at 9 . WaterStone Bank has not opted into the community bank leverage ratio. 
 
 Safety and Soundness Standards 
 
 Each federal banking agency, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits, and information security. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 
 
 Federal bank regulatory authorities are required to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, a bank is deemed to be (i) "well capitalized" if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0 or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more, has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5.0 or more and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or more, and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or more, a Tier 1 leveraged capital ratio of 4.0 or more and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or more, and does not meet the definition of "well capitalized"; (iii) "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 ; (iv) "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 ; and (v) "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . 

- 22 -

Table of Contents 

Federal law and regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an institution classified as less than well capitalized to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). 
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may order savings banks that have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a savings bank that is categorized as undercapitalized is subject to growth limitations and is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and a holding company that controls such a savings bank is required to guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan. A significantly undercapitalized savings bank may be subject to additional restrictions. Savings banks deemed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be critically undercapitalized would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank was considered well-capitalized with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 20.46 , Tier 1 leverage ratio of 17.08 , a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 20.46 and a total risk based capital ratio of 21.52 . 
 
 A qualifying institution whose tier 1 capital equals or exceeds the specified community bank leverage ratio and opts into that framework will be considered well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes. 
 
 Banking regulators addressed the regulatory capital treatment of credit loss allowance under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (CECL) methodology by allowing banking organizations an option to phase in the day-one regulatory capital effects. See Note 1 for the section "Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information regarding the adoption of this standard. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Under Wisconsin law and applicable regulations, a Wisconsin savings bank that meets its regulatory capital requirements may declare dividends on capital stock based upon net profits, provided that its paid-in surplus equals its capital stock. In addition, prior WDFI approval is required before dividends exceeding 50 of net profits for any calendar year may be declared and before a stock dividend may be declared out of retained earnings. Under WDFI regulations, a Wisconsin savings bank which has converted from mutual to stock form also is prohibited from paying a dividend on its capital stock if the payment causes the regulatory capital of the savings bank to fall below the amount required for its liquidation account. 
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to prohibit WaterStone Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of WaterStone Bank. Institutions may not pay dividends if they would be undercapitalized following payment of the dividend within the meaning of the prompt corrective action regulations. 
 
 Information with respect to regulation regarding dividends declared and paid by Waterstone Financial is disclosed under "Holding Company Dividends." 
 
 Liquidity and Reserves 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under WDFI regulations, all Wisconsin savings banks are required to maintain a certain amount of their assets as liquid assets, consisting of cash and certain types of investments. The exact amount of assets a savings bank is required to maintain as liquid assets is set by the WDFI, but generally ranges from 4 to 15 of the savings bank s average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts plus short-term borrowings (the Required Liquidity Ratio ). At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank s Required Liquidity Ratio was 8.0 , and WaterStone Bank was in compliance with this requirement. In addition, 50 of the liquid assets maintained by a Wisconsin savings bank must consist of primary liquid assets, which are defined to include securities issued by the United States Government, United States Government agencies, or the state of Wisconsin or a subdivision thereof, and cash. At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank was in compliance with this requirement. 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation . Under federal law and regulations, WaterStone Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound banking practices. Regulation D, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, imposes reserve requirements on all depository institutions, including WaterStone Bank, which maintain transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. Checking accounts, NOW accounts, Super NOW checking accounts, and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits (including certain money market deposit accounts) at a savings institution. However, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero, thereby effectively eliminating the requirements. The Federal Reserve Board took that action due to a change in its approach to monetary policy; it has indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements but could in the future if conditions warrant.

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 
 Wisconsin Law and Regulation . Under Wisconsin law, a savings bank may not make a loan to a person owning 10 or more of its stock, an affiliated person (including a director, officer, the spouse of either and a member of the immediate family of such person who is living in the same residence), agent, or attorney of the savings bank, either individually or as an agent or partner of another, except as under the rules of the WDFI and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, unless the prior approval of the WDFI is obtained, a savings bank may not purchase, lease or acquire a site for an office building or an interest in real estate from an affiliated person, including a shareholder owning more than 10 of its capital stock, or from any firm, corporation, entity or family in which an affiliated person or 10 shareholder has a direct or indirect interest. 
 
 Federal Law and Regulation. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act govern transactions between an insured savings bank, such as WaterStone Bank, and any of its affiliates, including Waterstone Financial. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted Regulation W, which comprehensively implements and interprets Sections 23A and 23B, in part by codifying prior Federal Reserve Board interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B. 
 
 An affiliate of a savings bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the savings bank. A subsidiary of a savings bank that is not also a depository institution or a financial subsidiary under federal law is not treated as an affiliate of the savings bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a savings bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which a savings bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such savings bank s capital stock and surplus, and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans and other extensions of credit by a savings bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. In addition, any affiliate transaction by a savings bank must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings bank as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate, and be consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 
 
 A savings bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10 of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O thereunder. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, (which is generally 15 of capital and surplus). Aggregate loans by a savings bank to its insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the savings bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s primary residence, may not exceed the greater of 25,000 or 2.5 of the savings bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than 100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the savings bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either 500,000 or the greater of 25,000 or 5 of the savings bank s unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability. 
 
 An exception to the requirement is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the savings bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. Consistent with these requirements, the Bank offered employees special terms for home mortgage loans on their principal residences. Effective April 1, 2006, this program was discontinued for new loan originations. Under the terms of the discontinued program, the employee interest rate is based on the Bank s cost of funds on December 31st of the immediately preceding year and is adjusted annually. At December 31, 2022, the rate of interest on an employee rate mortgage loan was 0.73 , compared to the weighted average rate of 4.81 on all single family mortgage loans. This rate will increase to 1.75 effective March 1, 2023. Employee rate mortgage loans totaled 495,000, or 0.1 , of our single family residential mortgage loan portfolio on December 31, 2022. 
 
 Transactions between Bank Customers and Affiliates 
 
 Wisconsin savings banks, such as WaterStone Bank, are subject to the prohibitions on certain tying arrangements. Subject to certain exceptions, a savings bank is prohibited from extending credit to or offering any other service to a customer, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that such customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
 
 Examinations and Assessments 
 
 WaterStone Bank is required to file periodic reports with and is subject to periodic examinations by the WDFI and FDIC. WaterStone Bank is required to pay examination fees and annual assessments to fund its supervision. Federal regulations require annual on-site examinations for all depository institutions except certain well-capitalized and highly rated institutions with assets of less than 3 billion which are examined every 18 months.

Customer Privacy 
 
 Under Wisconsin and federal law and regulations, savings banks, such as WaterStone Bank, are required to develop and maintain privacy policies relating to information on its customers, restrict access to and establish procedures to protect customer data. Applicable privacy regulations further restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties if the customer requests. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act, WaterStone Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of WaterStone Bank, to assess WaterStone Bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s evaluation of certain applications by WaterStone Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank s Community Reinvestment Act performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching or merger) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. In May 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other federal bank regulatory agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations and framework. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, WaterStone Bank was rated satisfactory with respect to its Community Reinvestment Act compliance. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 
 The Federal Home Loan Bank System, consisting of 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The designated duties of the Federal Housing Finance Board are to supervise the Federal Home Loan Banks; ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks carry out their housing finance mission; ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks remain adequately capitalized and able to raise funds in the capital markets; and ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks operate in a safe and sound manner. 
 
 WaterStone Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in specified amounts. WaterStone Bank is in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock of 17.4 million at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Among other benefits, the Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Federal Housing Finance Board and the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank had 385.7 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. 
 
 USA PATRIOT Act 
 
 The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. 
 
 Regulation of Waterstone Mortgage Corporation 
 
 Waterstone Mortgage Corporation is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on its business. These laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions to which Waterstone Mortgage Corporation is subject include those pertaining to: real estate settlement procedures; fair lending; fair credit reporting; truth in lending; compliance with net worth and financial statement delivery requirements; compliance with federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements; the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; secured transactions; collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures; other trade practices and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers; and guidance on non-traditional mortgage loans issued by the federal financial regulatory agencies.

Holding Company Regulation 
 
 Waterstone Financial is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Waterstone Financial and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, that authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to WaterStone Bank. In addition, any company that owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 25 of the voting securities of a state savings bank is subject to regulation as a savings bank holding company by the WDFI. Waterstone Financial is subject to regulation as a savings bank holding company under Wisconsin law. However, the WDFI has not issued specific regulations governing stock savings bank holding companies. 
 
 The business activities of savings and loan holding companies are generally limited to those activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations, unless the holding company has elected financial holding company status. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Waterstone Financial has not elected financial holding company status. Federal law generally prohibits the acquisition of more than 5 of a class of voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities. 
 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5 of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board is required to impose upon bank and savings and loan holding companies consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are equally stringent as those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions. However, the small holding company exception for holding companies with less than 3 billion of consolidated assets, such as Waterstone Financial, generally results in such companies not being subject to the requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act extended the "source of strength" doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board promulgated regulations implementing the "source of strength" policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund a proposed dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The guidance also provides for prior consultation with supervisory staff for material increases in the amount of a company s common stock dividend. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff, to provide opportunity for supervisory review and possible objection, prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Waterstone Financial to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

Holding Company Dividends 
 
 Waterstone Financial is not permitted to pay dividends on its common stock if its stockholders equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account established by Waterstone Financial in connection with the conversion. In addition, Waterstone Financial is subject to relevant state corporate law limitations and federal bank regulatory policy on the payment of dividends. Maryland law, which is the state of Waterstone Financial s incorporation, generally limits dividends if the corporation would not be able to pay its debts in the usual course of business after giving effect to the dividend or if the corporation s total assets would be less than the corporation s total liabilities plus the amount needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution. 
 
 The dividend rate and continued payment of dividends will depend on a number of factors, including our capital requirements, our financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory limitations, and general economic conditions. 
 
 Federal Securities Laws Regulation 
 
 Securities Exchange Act. Waterstone Financial common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Waterstone Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Waterstone Financial may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Waterstone Financial are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Waterstone Financial meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of Waterstone Financial that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1 of the outstanding shares of Waterstone Financial, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, Waterstone Financial may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as Waterstone Financial unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act federal law, means ownership, control of or the power to vote 25 or more of any class of voting stock. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a savings and loan holding company s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Waterstone Financial, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 In addition, the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act provides that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company (as control is defined for purposes of that statute) without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a savings and loan holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Effective September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board adopted changes to its regulatory definition of control under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. Relevant factors include a company s voting and nonvoting equity interests in the savings and loan holding company, director, officer and employee overlaps and the scope of business relationships between the company and the savings and loan holding company or its subsidiary institution. 
 
 Federal and State Taxation 
 
 Federal Taxation 
 
 General. Waterstone Financial and subsidiaries are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Waterstone Financial and subsidiaries constitute an affiliated group of corporations and, therefore, are eligible to report their income on a consolidated basis. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Waterstone Financial or WaterStone Bank. The Company is no longer subject to federal tax examinations for years before 2019.

Table of Contents 

Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Waterstone Financial currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. 
 
 Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), WaterStone Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, WaterStone Bank was required to use the specific charge-off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2022, WaterStone Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year. 
 
 Waterstone Financial is required to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions. 
 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if WaterStone Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if WaterStone Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a bank for tax purposes. At December 31, 2022, our total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve was approximately 16.7 million. 
 
 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Waterstone Financial may exclude from its federal taxable income 100 of dividends received from WaterStone Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65 when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 20 of the stock of the distributing corporation. The dividends-received deduction is 50 when the corporation receiving the dividend owns less than 20 of the distributing corporation. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, among other things, implements a new alternative minimum tax of 15 on corporations with profits in excess of 1 billion, a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy and climate initiatives. These provisions are effective beginning January 1, 2023. Based on its analysis of the provisions, the Company does not expect this legislation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 State Taxation 
 
 The Company is subject to primarily the Wisconsin corporate franchise (income) tax and taxation in a number of states due primarily to the operations of the mortgage banking segment. Under current law, the state of Wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of 7.9 on the combined taxable incomes of the members of our consolidated income tax group. 
 
 The years open to examination by state and local government authorities varies by jurisdiction. 
 
 As a Maryland business corporation, Waterstone Financial is required to file an annual report and pay franchise taxes to the state of Maryland. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 An investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business and the industry in which we operate. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information included in this report, as well as other reports we file with the SEC. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to these risks and the other risks and uncertainties described in Item 1, Business-Forward Looking Statements and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and we are subject to supervision, examination and enforcement action by various bank regulatory agencies. 
 
 We are subject to extensive supervision, regulation, and examination by the WDFI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities, and obtain financing. This system of regulation is designed primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and our depositors, and not for the benefit of our stockholders. Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. 
 
 Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as WaterStone Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, paying dividends, acquiring other financial institutions or establishing new branches. 
 
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network. 
 
 Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. 
 
 The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. 
 
 Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 
 
 We are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties. 
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act CRA ), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support WaterStone Bank. 
 
 Federal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Thus, any borrowing or funds needed to raise capital required to make a capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Interest Rates 
 
 The reversal of the historically low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board decreased benchmark interest rates significantly, to near zero, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve Board has reversed its policy of near zero interest rates given its concerns over inflation. Market interest rates have risen in response to the Federal Reserve Board s recent rate increases. As discussed below, the increase in market interest rates is expected to have an adverse effect on our net interest income and profitability. 
 
 Changing interest rates may have a negative effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Our earnings and cash flows are dependent on our net interest income and income from our mortgage banking operations. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. 
 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest-earning investment securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled 196.6 million. Net unrealized losses on these securities totaled 26.1 million at December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred other comprehensive losses of 18.3 million, net of tax benefit, related to net changes in unrealized holding losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. 
 
 Increases in interest rates can also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. A portion of our loans have adjustable interest rates. While the higher payment amounts we would receive on these loans in a rising interest rate environment may increase our interest income, some borrowers may be unable to afford the higher payment amounts, which may result in a higher rate of loan delinquencies and defaults, as well as lower loan originations, as borrowers who may qualify for a loan based on certain mortgage repayments, may not be able to afford repayments based on higher interest rates for the same loan amounts. The marketability of the underlying collateral also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. Furthermore, in a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which would be expected to compress our interest rate spread and have a negative effect on our profitability. 
 
 Any increase in market interest rates may reduce our mortgage banking income. We generate revenues primarily from gains on the sale of mortgage loans to investors, and from the amortization of deferred mortgage servicing rights. We had mortgage banking income decrease 91.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. We also earn interest on loans held for sale while awaiting delivery to our investors. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our mortgage loan originations may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available for sale. This would result in a decrease in interest income and a decrease in revenues from loan sales. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may continue to be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity. 
 
 Although we have implemented asset and liability management strategies designed to reduce the effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate models and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet. 
 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management of Market Risk. 
 
 Risks Related to Economic Matters 
 
 Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our earnings, as our borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans decline. 
 
 Economic conditions have an impact, to some extent, on our overall performance. Conditions such as an economic recession, rising unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings. Because a majority of our loans are secured by real estate, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings. Consequently, declines in the economy in our market area could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Because most of our borrowers are located in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin metropolitan area, a prolonged downturn in the local economy, or a decline in local real estate values, could cause an increase in nonperforming loans or a decrease in loan demand, which would reduce our profits. 
 
 Substantially all of our loans are secured by real estate located in our primary market area. Weakness in our local economy and our local real estate markets could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Real estate values are affected by various factors, including supply and demand, changes in general or regional economic conditions, interest rates, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters. Weakness in economic conditions also could result in reduced loan demand and a decline in loan originations. In particular, a significant decline in real estate values would likely lead to a decrease in new loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults by our borrowers, as well as increases in our allowance for loan losses.

Inflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers. 
 
 Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Over the past year, in response to a pronounced rise in inflation, the Federal Reserve Board has raised certain benchmark interest rates to combat inflation. As inflation increases and market interest rates rise the value of our investment securities, particularly those with longer maturities, would decrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments. In addition, inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as electricity and other utilities, which increases our non-interest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay their loans with us. Sustained higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board to tame persistent inflationary price pressures could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Lending Matters 
 
 We intend to increase our commercial business lending, and we intend to continue our commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate lending, which may expose us to increased lending risks and have a negative effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We continue to focus on originating commercial business, commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate loans. These types of loans generally have a higher risk of loss compared to our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Commercial business loans may expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, commercial business and commercial real estate loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate loans as repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business. Also, the collateral underlying commercial business loans may fluctuate in value. Some of our commercial business loans are collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, and the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use. Multi-family residential real estate and commercial real estate loans involve increased risk because repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover property maintenance and debt service. In addition, if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for a single -family residential property if there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb life-time losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Under the current expected credit loss model, the allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation allowance estimated at each balance sheet date in accordance with GAAP that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. We estimate the ACL on loans based on the underlying assets amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the financing receivable is originated or acquired, adjusted for applicable accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash, and charge-offs. Expected credit losses are reflected in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to credit loss expense. When we deem all or a portion of a financial asset to be uncollectible the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. We apply judgment to determine when a financial asset is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, an asset will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts at collection have been exhausted. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received. 
 
 We measure expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis, when the financial assets share similar risk characteristics. Depending on the nature of the pool of financial assets with similar risk characteristics, we use loss-rate methods to estimate expected credit losses. Our methodologies for estimating the ACL consider available relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical loss experience was observed. Our methodologies revert back to historical loss information on a straight-line basis over one year when it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For collateral dependent financial assets where we have determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we expect repayment of the financial asset to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized costs basis of the financial asset exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. 
 
 We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. 
 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or regulations, or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws and regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability, and heightened pressure from investors and other stakeholders may require us to incur additional expenses with respect to environmental matters. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.

The foreclosure process may adversely impact our recoveries on non-performing loans 
 
 The judicial foreclosure process is protracted, which delays our ability to resolve non-performing loans through the sale of the underlying collateral. The longer timelines have been the result of the economic crisis, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, increased documentary requirements and judicial scrutiny, and, both voluntary and mandatory programs under which lenders may consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. These reasons and the legal and regulatory responses have impacted the foreclosure process and completion time of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders. This may result in a material adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to minimize its losses. 
 
 Risks Related to Operational Matters 
 
 We rely heavily on certificates of deposit, which has increased our cost of funds and could continue to do so in the future. 
 
 Our reliance on certificates of deposit to fund our operations has resulted in a higher cost of funds than would otherwise be the case if we had a higher percentage of demand deposits, savings deposits and money market accounts. In addition, if our certificates of deposit do not remain with us, we may be required to access other sources of funds, including loan sales, other types of deposits, including replacement certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and other borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on our certificates of deposit. 
 
 We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people. 
 
 Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense, and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. 
 
 Loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers. 
 
 Our business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationship with our key personnel is good, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization. Loss of such key personnel, should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors, could result in the loss of some of our customers. 
 
 Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks. 
 
 We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation. 
 
 Risks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of cybersecurity could negatively affect our earnings. 
 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we take numerous protective measures and otherwise endeavor to protect and maintain the privacy and security of confidential data, these systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, other malicious code, cyber-attacks, cyber-theft and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events were to occur, this potentially could jeopardize confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our systems or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers' operations. 
 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 
 The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully covered by our insurance. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. 
 
 Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.

Our business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes. 
 
 Our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. We have experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, losses may still occur. 
 
 Our funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth. 
 
 We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources, which may include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, federal funds purchased and brokered certificates of deposit. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. 
 
 Risks Related to Competitive Matters 
 
 Consumers may decide to use alternative options to complete financial transactions. 
 
 Technology is allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. Consumers can now easily access historically banking needs through online banking accounts, brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete certain transactions without the assistance of banks. 
 
 The removal of banking with financial transactions could result in the loss of customer loans, customer deposits, and the related fee income generated from those loans and deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability. 
 
 Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, money market funds, insurance companies, and brokerage firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide, all of which benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Competitive factors driven by consumer sentiment or otherwise can also reduce our ability to generate fee income, such as through overdraft fees. 
 
 Risks Related to Mortgage Banking Operations 
 
 Secondary mortgage market conditions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our mortgage banking operations provide a significant portion of our non-interest income. In addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. In light of current conditions, there is greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. We believe our ability to retain fixed-rate residential mortgage loans is limited. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan production volumes and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in the programs offered by secondary market purchasers or our ability to qualify for their programs may reduce our mortgage banking revenues, which would negatively impact our non-interest income. 
 
 We generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and non-GSE investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 If we are required to repurchase mortgage loans that we have previously sold, it could negatively affect our earnings. 
 
 One of our primary business operations is our mortgage banking, which involves originating residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we have sold in cases of borrower default or breaches of these representations and warranties. If we are required to repurchase mortgage loans or provide indemnification or other recourse, this could increase our costs and thereby affect our future earnings.

Risks Related to Environmental and Other Global Matters 
 
 Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. 
 
 Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and other issues. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on role in carbon intensive activities. among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of asset securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. 
 
 Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics, and other catastrophic events. 
 
 We could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or other reason. Any of these events could result in the temporary reduction of operations, employees, and customers, which could limit our ability to provide services. Additionally, many of our borrowers may suffer property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs after such events. Those borrowers might not be able to repay their loans, and the collateral for such loans may decline significantly in value. 
 
 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. 
 
 Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have continued to affect the macroeconomic environment, both nationally and in the Company s existing geographic footprint. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be fully controlled and abated. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences could result in a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, and if these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in our Form 10-K could be exacerbated and such effects could have a material adverse impact on us in a number of ways. 
 
 Risks Related to Accounting Matters 
 
 Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. 
 
 From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which may result in our restating our prior period financial statements. 
 
 The need to account for certain assets at estimated fair value may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 We report certain assets, such as loans held for sale, at estimated fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize observable market inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.

Other Risks Related to Our Business 
 
 Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us or the financial services industry in general. 
 
 We, and other participants in the financial services industry upon whom we rely to operate, have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. Most of the proceedings we consider to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and other participants in the financial services industry or we may not prevail in any proceeding or litigation. 
 
 Any litigation or regulatory proceeding could entail substantial costs and divert management s attention away from our operations, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations. 
 
 Changes in the valuation of our securities portfolio could adversely affect our profits. 
 
 Our securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in fair value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in fair value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a monthly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts reports and, to a lesser extent given the relatively insignificant levels of depreciation in our debt portfolio, spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. In analyzing an equity issuer s financial condition, management considers industry analysts reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts within a one-year time frame. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. The declines in fair value could result in a material adverse effect on our capital levels. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred other comprehensive losses of 18.3 million, net of tax benefit, related to net changes in unrealized holding losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. 
 
 New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. 
 
 From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 
 Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.

Acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value. 
 
 We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt, or equity securities may occur at any time. We would seek acquisition partners that offer us either significant market presence or the potential to expand our market footprint and improve profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. 
 
 Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on our financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things: 

difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; 

payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term; 

potential exposure to unknown or contingent tax or other liabilities of the target company; 

exposure to potential asset quality problems of the target company; 

potential volatility in reported income associated with goodwill impairment losses; 

difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company; 

inability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits; 

potential disruption to our business; 

potential diversion of our management s time and attention; 

the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; and 

potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. 

Various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve. 
 
 Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, federal regulations, Maryland law, shares of restricted stock and stock options that we have granted or may grant to employees and directors and stock ownership by our management and directors, and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of Waterstone Financial without the consent of our board of directors. A shareholder may want a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential acquiror could offer a premium over the then prevailing price of our common stock.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction therewith. The detailed discussion in the sections below focuses on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 2021, and the financial condition as of December 31, 2022 compared to the financial condition as of December 31, 2021.

Table of Contents 

As described in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we have two reportable segments: community banking and mortgage banking. The community banking segment provides consumer and business banking products and services to customers. Consumer products include loan products, deposit products, and personal investment services. Business banking products include loans for working capital, inventory and general corporate use, commercial real estate construction loans, and deposit accounts. The mortgage banking segment, which is conducted through Waterstone Mortgage Corporation, consists of originating residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary market. 
 
 Our community banking segment generates the significant majority of our consolidated net interest income and requires the significant majority of our provision for credit losses. Our mortgage banking segment generates the significant majority of our noninterest income and a majority of our noninterest expenses. We have provided below a discussion of the material results of operations for each segment on a separate basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared the year ended December 31, 2021, which focuses on noninterest income and noninterest expenses. We have also provided a discussion of the consolidated operations of Waterstone Financial, which includes the consolidated operations of WaterStone Bank and Waterstone Mortgage Corporation, for the same periods. 
 
 For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, see Part II, Item 7: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Discussion of Results of Operations included in our 2021 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 Accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve a heightened level of management judgment due to the complexity, subjectivity and sensitivity involved in their application. 
 
 See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contains a further discussion of our significant accounting policies. 
 
 Critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The ACL represents management's estimate of current expected credit losses, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, on our loan portfolio and the amount of credit loss impairment on our AFS securities portfolio. Determining the amount of the ACL is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its complexity and because it requires extensive judgment and estimation. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have a material impact on the amount of the ACL include: 

Our evaluation of current conditions; 

Our assessment that the physical condition of the real estate has not significantly changed since the last valuation date; 

Our determination of a reasonable and supportable economic forecast and selection of the reasonable and supportable forecast period; 

Our evaluation of historical loss experience; 

Our evaluation of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, including internal risk ratings; 

Our estimate of expected prepayments; 

Our selection of models and modeling techniques may also have a material impact on the estimate; 

The value of underlying collateral, which may impact loss severity and certain cash flow assumptions for collateral-dependent, criticized and classified loans; 

Our selection and evaluation of qualitative factors; and 

Our estimate of expected cash flows on AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions. 

The appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the WaterStone Bank Board of Directors. The allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the future losses over the life of the loan portfolio, and is based on a loss model using a forecast and historical losses developed and implemented by management and approved by the WaterStone Bank Board of Directors. 
 
 Actual results could differ from this estimate, and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions. More specifically, if our future charge-off experience increases substantially from our past experience, or if the value of underlying loan collateral, in our case mostly real estate, declines in value by a substantial amount, or if unemployment in our primary market area increases significantly, our allowance for credit losses may be inadequate and we will incur higher provisions for loan losses and lower net income in the future. 
 
 See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the ACL.

Table of Contents 

In addition, state and federal regulators periodically review the WaterStone Bank allowance for credit losses. Such regulators have the authority to require WaterStone Bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination. 
 
 Income Taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal, combined state income tax, and separate state income tax returns. The provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on the income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
 Under generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Examples of positive evidence may include the existence of taxes paid in available carry-back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods. Examples of negative evidence may include cumulative losses in a current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends. 
 
 Positions taken in the Company s tax returns are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements. The Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a standard framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. A number of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the Company s financial statements. The valuation techniques include quoted market prices for investment securities, appraisals of real estate from independent licensed appraisers and other valuation techniques. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates, and are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the valuation results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values. Significant changes in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value or for impairment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations under the framework established by generally accepted accounting principles.

Comparison of Consolidated Waterstone Financial, Inc. Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 
 
 Total Assets. Total assets decreased by 184.2 million, or 8.3 , to 2.03 billion at December 31, 2022 from 2.22 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in total assets primarily reflects a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and loans held for sale, partially offset by an increase in loans held for investment, securities available for sale and other assets. The total assets decrease reflects liability decreases in deposits and borrowings. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 330.1 million to 46.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 376.7 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the increases in loans held for investment, securities available for sale and decrease of funding sources from deposits and borrowings. 
 
 Securities Available for Sale . Securities available for sale increased by 17.6 million to 196.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 179.0 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to purchases of mortgage-related securities to take advantage of the increase in interest rates. The purchases are exceeding security paydowns for the year and maturities of debt securities. Also offsetting the purchases, the decline in fair market value of the portfolio decreased due to rising interest rates. 
 
 Loans Held for Sale . Loans held for sale decreased 181.6 million, or 58.1 , to 131.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 312.7 million at December 31, 2021 due to the decrease of refinancing activity resulting from the increase in mortgage rates.

Table of Contents 

Loans Receivable . Loans receivable held for investment increased 304.4 million, or 25.2 , to 1.51 billion at December 31, 2022 from 1.21 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total loans receivable was attributable to increases in each of the one- to four-family, multi-family, and commercial real estate loan categories. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses increased 2.0 million to 17.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 15.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase primarily resulted from the 1.0 million provision increase due to the increase in loans held in portfolio along with the CECL model adoption on January 1, 2022. The CECL calculation resulted in an opening balance adjustment of 430,000 to increase the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, net recoveries totaled 519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made adjustments to our forecast factor to reflect the current economic forecast, and qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. See Note 3 - Loans Receivable of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Total prepaid expenses and other assets increased 14.6 million to 59.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 45.1 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the fair value mark on derivatives as interest rates increased and deferred taxes increased as unrealized losses on available for sale securities increased due to rising interest rates. 
 
 Deposits. Deposits decreased by 34.4 million to 1.20 billion at December 31, 2022, from 1.23 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was driven by a decrease of 66.2 million in money market and savings deposits offset by an increase of 16.2 million in demand deposits and an increase of 15.6 in time deposits. 
 
 Borrowings. Total borrowings decreased 90.3 million to 386.8 million at December 31, 2022, from 477.1 million at December 31, 2021. The community banking segment paid off 420.0 million in long-term FHLB borrowings and 5.0 million in short-term borrowings, borrowing 150.0 million of new long-term FHLB borrowings, and 187.5 million in new short-term FHLB borrowings. External short-term borrowings at the mortgage banking segment decreased a total of 1.0 million to 1.1 million at December 31, 2022 from 2.0 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Other Liabilities. Other liabilities increased 1.6 million to 70.1 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 68.5 million at December 31, 2021. Other liabilities increased primarily due to increase of the fair value mark on derivative liabilities related to the loans held for sale and the back-to-back swaps increased with the increase in interest rates offset by a decrease in dividends payable as a special dividend was declared in December 2021 and paid in February 2022. 
 
 Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity decreased by 62.3 million, or 14.4 , to 370.5 million at December 31, 2022 from 432.8 million at December 31, 2021. Shareholders' equity decreased primarily due to the declaration of dividends, a decrease in the fair value of the security portfolio, the repurchase of stock and the adoption of CECL. Partially offsetting the decreases, there were increases due to the net income, additional paid-in capital as stock options were exercised and equity awards vested, and unearned ESOP shares vesting. 
 
 Comparison of Community Banking Segment Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 Net income from our community banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 22.8 million compared to 28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest income increased 555,000 to 56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest income increased primarily due to an increase in interest earned on mortgage-related securities and cash as the federal funds rates raises throughout the year along with a decrease on borrowing interest expense as less borrowings were needed to fund the mortgage banking segment line of credit. Offsetting the those increases to net interest income, interest earned on loans decreased as the mortgage banking segment line decreased as volumes slowed and interest expense on deposits increased as funding rates matched the federal funds rate increases. 
 
 There was a provision for credit losses of 677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a negative provision for loan losses of 4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The provision for credit losses consisted of a 740,000 provision related to loans due to loan growth and a 62,000 of negative provision related to unfunded commitments as the balance decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made adjustments to our forecast factor to reflect the current economic forecast, and qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. 
 
 Noninterest income decreased 837,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to a decrease in service fees on deposits and prepayment fees on loans during the year ended December 31, 2022, offset by a gain from death benefit received on one bank owned life insurance policy and an increase in bank owned life insurance as interest rates increased.

Table of Contents 

Compensation, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits expense decreased 1.3 million to 19.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in health insurance, variable compensation, ESOP expense compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Other noninterest expense increased 3.6 million to 5.6 million as certain loan-related expenses paid to the mortgage banking segment for the purchase of single-family adjustable rate mortgage loans increased. These fees are eliminated in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 Net loss totaled 3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of 42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We originated 2.76 billion in mortgage loans held for sale (including sales to the community banking segment) during the year ended December 31, 2022, which represents a decrease of 1.47 billion, or 34.6 , from the 4.23 billion originated during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in loan production volume was driven by a 986.3 million, or 76.6 , decrease in refinance products driven by an increase in fixed mortgage rates. Mortgage purchase products decreased 478.8 million, or 16.3 due to inventory constraints in the market, housing affordability, and as interest rates have increased. Total mortgage banking noninterest income decreased 93.5 million, or 47.3 , to 104.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 197.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in mortgage banking noninterest income was related to a 34.6 decrease in volume and a 18.3 decrease in gross margin on loans originated and sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. The gross margin on loans originated and sold contraction reflects decreased industry demand due to the increased competition from mortgage originators. We sell loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing-retained basis. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which we retain servicing. 
 
 Additionally, our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or U.S. Department of Agriculture loan. Our origination efforts continue to be focused on loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, as opposed to mortgage refinance. The percentage of origination volume related to purchase activity increased to 89.1 from 69.5 of total originations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as refinance demand decelerated due to an increase in interest rates over the past year. The mix of loan type trended towards more governmental loans and less conventional loans, with governmental loans and conventional loans comprising 29.3 and 70.7 , respectively of all loan originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 23.4 and 76.6 of all originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no sales of mortgage servicing rights. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to 1.24 billion in loans serviced for third parties. The sale generated 12.4 million in net proceeds and a 4.0 million gain. 
 
 Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased 34.3 million, or 29.7 , to 81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 115.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in compensation expense was primarily related to decreased commission expense and branch manager compensation driven by decreased loan origination volume and branch profitability as gross margins decreased. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the segment has added 11 branches and a total of 130 loan origination personnel. Losses associated with these new branches totaled approximately 1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. These branch losses are net of corporate revenue of approximately 1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Waterstone Mortgage Corporation originates loans in various states. The states where we originate greater than 10 of total activity are Florida and New Mexico.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments for any of the years presented.

Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income increased 1.4 million, or 2.6 , to 57.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 55.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Interest income on loans decreased 1.4 million, or 2.2 , to 62.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to a 144.9 million, or 45.6 , decrease in average loans as loans held for sale originations decreased as interest rates increased. This decrease was partially offset by a 27 basis point increase in average yield on loans as interest rates continue to increase over the past year and an increase in average loan balance of 12.1 million, or 0.9 , in the average balance of loans held in portfolio. 

Interest income from mortgage related securities increased 1.3 million, or 65.9 , primarily as the average balance increased 59.3 million. 

Interest expense on time deposits increased 135,000, or 3.9 , primarily due to a nine basis point increase in average cost of time deposits. Offsetting the average cost of time deposits increase, the average balance of time deposits decreased 73.2 million compared to the prior year.

Table of Contents 

Interest expense on money market, savings, and escrow accounts increased 297,000, or 32.9 , due primarily to a six basis point increase in average cost of money market, savings, and escrow accounts and the average balance increased 27.2 million. 

Interest expense on borrowings decreased 1.5 million, or 15.3 , due to a 130.8 million decrease in the average balance of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as 470.0 million in FHLB borrowings paid off and 385.7 million in new FHLB borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2022. The FHLB borrowings decreased was primarily due to the decrease in loans held for sale. 

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company adopted ASC Topic 326 as of January 1, 2022, which resulted in an opening balance adjustment of 430,000 to increase the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, there was a 1.4 million opening balance adjustment to record an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, which is presented in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Net of tax impact, the adoption of the CECL model resulted in a 1.4 million reduction to retained earnings. 
 
 There was a provision for credit losses of 968,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a 4.0 million negative provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 968,000 provision for credit losses consisted of a 1.0 million provision related to loans and a 62,000 of negative provision related to unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made adjustments to our forecast factor to reflect the current economic forecast, and qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. 
 
 The provision is primarily a function of the Company's reserving methodology and assessments of certain quantitative and qualitative factors which are used to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses for the period. See further discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses in the "Asset Quality" section for an analysis of charge-offs, nonperforming assets, specific reserves and additional provisions and the "Allowance for Credit Loss" section.

Total noninterest income decreased 97.6 million, or 48.1 , to 105.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 203.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in mortgage banking income along with decreases from no gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. 

The decrease in mortgage banking income was primarily the result of a decrease in loan origination volume and gross margin on loans originated and sold. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. Total loan origination volume on a consolidated basis decreased 1.65 billion, or 39.3 , to 2.55 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 4.20 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin on loans originated and sold decreased 18.3 at the mortgage banking segment. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. See "Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Year December 31, 2022 and 2021" above, for additional discussion of the increase in mortgage banking income. 

Service charges on loans and deposits decreased primarily due to a decrease in loan prepayment fees. 

The decrease in other noninterest income was due primarily to a gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights in 2021 and decreases in mortgage servicing fee income as a result of the servicing fees prior to the sale. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to 1.24 billion in loans serviced for third parties. The sale generated 12.4 million in net proceeds and a 4.0 million gain. There was no comparable sale during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company maintained servicing rights related to 409.6 million and 204.8 million, respectively, in loans previously sold to third parties. Offsetting the decreases, there was a 340,000 increase in gain from death benefit received on one bank owned life insurance policy during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to none during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefit expense at our mortgage banking segment decreased 34.3 million, or 29.7 , to 81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in compensation expense was primarily related to decreased commission expense and branch manager compensation driven by decreased loan origination volume and branch profitability as gross margins decreased. 

Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense at the community banking segment decreased 1.3 million, or 6.3 , to 19.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in health insurance, variable compensation, and ESOP expense as the average stock price has decreased compared to the year ending December 31, 2021, offset by an increase in salaries due to annual raises. 

Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the mortgage banking segment decreased 770,000 to 5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily resulting from lower rent, computer, and depreciation expenses. 

Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the community banking segment decreased 136,000 to 3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to decreased depreciation expense and maintenance expense. 

Advertising expense increased 448,000, or 12.7 , to 4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to an increase at the mortgage banking segment in an effort to increase new customers. 

Data processing expense increased 520,000, or 13.2 , to 4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to increases at the community banking and mortgage banking segments for continued investments in technology and security. 

Professional fees increased 540,000, or 42.4 , to 1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to receiving a countersuit settlement related to a previously closed legal matter at the mortgage banking segment during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Other noninterest expense increased 1.3 million, or 12.4 , to 12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Other noninterest expenses increased at the mortgage banking segment increased as the provision for loan sale losses and corporate meetings expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2022. Offsetting the increases at the mortgage banking segment, the amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights decreased due to the bulk sale of mortgage servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 16.3 million to 5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 21.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as pretax income decreased 67.6 million. Income tax expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 at an effective rate of 20.4 compared to an effective rate of 23.1 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the effective rate reflects an increase of permanent deductions relative to the amount of pretax income and additionally the 2022 rate reflects the lower state tax apportionment based on the final 2020 tax returns. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a 949,000 return to provision income tax adjustment to reflect actual state tax apportionment based on the final 2021 tax returns. There was no return to provision adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs. The liquidity ratio is equal to average daily cash and cash equivalents for the period divided by average total assets. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments, repay our borrowings, fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. The operational adequacy of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the Chief Financial Officer as supported by the Asset/Liability Committee. Liquidity is monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators. Regulatory liquidity, as required by the WDFI, is based on current liquid assets as a percentage of the prior month s average deposits and short-term borrowings. Minimum primary liquidity is equal to 4.0 of deposits and short-term borrowings and minimum total regulatory liquidity is equal to 8.0 of deposits and short-term borrowings. The Bank s primary and total regulatory liquidity at December 31, 2022 were 4.49 and 19.46 , respectively. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and repayment of loans, sales of loans held for sale, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competitors. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term, interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Additional sources of liquidity used to manage long- and short-term cash flows include advances from the FHLB. 
 
 A portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 46.6 million and 376.7 million, respectively, of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the calls and maturities of debt and mortgage related securities, increases in deposit accounts, Federal funds purchased and advances from the FHLB. 
 
 Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we originated on a consolidated basis 2.55 billion and 4.20 billion in loans for sale and sold loans on a consolidated basis of 2.81 billion and 4.48 billion. During the year ended December 2022, loan originations net of loan repayments resulted in a negative cash flows of 303.9 million. During the year ended December 2021, loan repayments net of loan originations resulted in a positive cash flows of 170.3 million. Cash received from the principal repayments of debt and mortgage related securities and maturity and calls of debt securities totaled 50.7 million and 49.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We purchased 90.0 million and 73.7 million in debt securities and mortgage related securities classified as available for sale during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net decrease in deposits was 34.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2022. The net increase in deposits was 48.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. We received a 1.2 million death benefit on a bank owned life insurance policy in 2022. There were net decreases in borrowings of 90.3 million and 30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we repurchased common stock of 47.8 million and 10.2 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we paid cash dividends on common stock of 30.3 million and 30.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Deposits decreased by 34.4 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by a decrease of 66.2 million in money market and savings deposits offset by an increase of 16.2 million in demand deposits and 15.6 million in time deposits. Deposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates, market conditions and products offered by local competitors and other factors. 
 
 Liquidity management is both a daily and longer-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB which provide an additional source of funds. At December 31, 2022, we had 185.7 million in short term advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, we had 200.0 million in long term advances from the FHLB with contractual maturity dates in 2025, 2027, and 2032. There are four advances that have contractual maturities in 2025. The 2027 advance has a contractual maturity date in December 2027. The 2032 advance has a quarterly call options which begins in March 2023. As an additional source of funds, the mortgage banking segment has a repurchase agreement. At December 31, 2022, we had 1.1 million outstanding under the repurchase agreement with a total outstanding commitment of 50.0 million.

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans receivable of 61.2 million. In addition, at December 31, 2022, we had unfunded commitments under construction loans of 48.5 million, unfunded commitments under business lines of credit of 17.4 million and unfunded commitments under home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit of 11.1 million. At December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled 502.3 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window or brokered deposits to maintain our level of assets. However, such borrowings may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, if and when needed. Alternatively, we would reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal. 
 
 Capital 
 
 Shareholders equity decreased by 62.3 million, or 14.4 , to 370.5 million at December 31, 2022 from 432.8 million at December 31, 2021. Shareholders' equity decreased primarily due to the declaration of dividends, a decrease in the fair value of the security portfolio, the repurchase of stock and the adoption of CECL. Partially offsetting the decreases, there were increases due to the net income, additional paid-in capital as stock options were exercised and equity awards vested, and unearned ESOP shares vesting. 
 
 The Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had repurchased 13.9 million shares at an average price of 15.27 under previously approved stock repurchase plans. 
 
 Waterstone Financial, Inc. and WaterStone Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2022, Waterstone Financial, Inc. and WaterStone Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Supervision and Regulation Capital Requirements and Note 9 - Regulatory Capital of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repaid 5.0 million in FHLB short-term debt and 470.0 million in FHLB long-term debt and borrowed 200.0 million of FHLB long-term debt and 185.7 million of short-term debt. 
 
 See Note 8 - Borrowings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the remaining maturities of our FHLB long-term debt.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Management of Market Risk 
 
 General . The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, WaterStone Bank s board of directors has established an Asset/Liability Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. Management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Committee meets at least weekly to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position, which are evaluated quarterly. 
 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: (i) emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one- to four-family, and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans; (ii) reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio; and (iii) whenever possible, lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the FHLBC. These measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments. 
 
 Income Simulation . Simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. At least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities. Our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments. Prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results. Because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage-backed securities we hold, rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a positive impact on net interest income and earnings. 
 
 The following interest rate scenario displays the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases of 100, 200 and 300 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points. The results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet accounts following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static (no growth balance sheet).

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The management of Waterstone Financial, Inc. (the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of; our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 
 CliftonLarsonAllen LLP has audited the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report dated February 28, 2023.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework , issued by COSO in 2013. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matters communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s estimate of the allowance for credit losses on loans was 17.8 million at December 31, 2022 on a loan portfolio of 1.51 billion. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) on loans is an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. The ACL considers historical loss rates, which are adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other qualitative adjustments. The Company segments the loan portfolio into loan pools based on loan type with similar origination years and similar credit risk elements. Loans that do not share credit risk elements are evaluated on an individual basis. For loan product types one-to-four family, multi family, commercial real estate, and commercial, an average historical loss rate is calculated by classifying net charge-offs by year of loan origin and dividing into total originations for that specific year. This methodology is referred to as vintage analysis. The average loss rate is then projected over the estimated remaining loan lives unique to each loan pool, to determine estimated lifetime losses. For loan product types construction and land and consumer, an average annual net loss rate is computed and extrapolated over the remaining life of the loans. This methodology is referred to as the weighted average remaining maturity method (WARM). For all loan pools the Company then considers the need for an additional allowance based upon qualitative factors as determined by pool. These qualitative factors are intended to adjust for changes not reflected in historical loss rates and otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination of the qualitative factors used in the allowance for credit losses for loans as a critical audit matter includes the subjectivity, complexity, and estimation uncertainty involved in determining significant model assumptions and adjusting model outputs to reflect economic and portfolio trends and conditions not captured within the models. 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 
 
 Obtained an understanding of the Company s models and the process for establishing the allowance for credit losses for the loan portfolio. 

Tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management s determination of the allowance for credit losses for loans, including controls over the allowance for credit losses models and the inputs and assumptions used to support the reserve calculations. Controls over the models include review of the model calculations and the macro-economic forecasts utilized in the models. Additionally, we tested controls over the approval of key policies and decisions during the implementation of the new accounting standard and validation of the models. 

Evaluated the reasonableness of management s application of industry and qualitative factor adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, including the comparison of factors considered by management to third party or internal sources as well as evaluated the appropriateness and level of the qualitative factor adjustments. 

Assessed the overall trends in credit quality by comparing the Company s quarterly changes in qualitative factors and the allowance for credit losses. 

Evaluated management s determination of reasonable and supportable forecasts, including comparing key factors to independent sources. 

Evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Company s conclusion. 

Testing the calculations used by management to translate the assumptions and key factors into the allowance estimated amount.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

operating segments community banking and mortgage banking. WaterStone Bank SSB (the "Bank" or "WaterStone Bank") is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits to originate real estate, business and consumer loans. 
 
 The Bank provides a full range of financial services to customers through branch locations in southeastern Wisconsin. The Bank is subject to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. 
 
 The Bank owns a mortgage banking subsidiary that originates residential real estate loans held for sale at various branch offices across the country. Mortgage banking volume fluctuates widely in connection with movements in interest rates. Mortgage banking income is reported as a single line item in the statements of operations while mortgage banking expense is distributed among the various noninterest expense lines. Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense fluctuates in relation to fluctuations in mortgage banking income. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock is carried at cost, which is the amount that the stock is redeemable by tendering to the FHLB or the amount at which shares can be sold to other FHLB members. 
 days after closing. 
 
 The Company has elected to carry loans held for sale at fair value. Fair value is generally determined by estimating a gross premium or discount, which is derived from pricing currently observable in the market. The amount by which cost differs from market value is accounted for as a valuation adjustment to the carrying value of the loans. Changes in value are included in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Costs to originate loans held for sale are expensed as incurred and are included on the appropriate noninterest expense lines of the statements of operations. Salaries, commissions and related payroll taxes are the primary costs to originate and comprised approximately of total mortgage banking noninterest expense for 2022 . 
 
 The value of mortgage loans held for sale and other residential mortgage loan commitments to customers are hedged by utilizing both best efforts and mandatory forward commitments to sell loans to investors in the secondary market. Such forward commitments are generally entered into at the time when applications are taken to protect the value of the mortgage loans from increases in market interest rates during the period held. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the expected future cash flows of servicing loans at the time a forward loan commitment is made. 
 consecutive contractual payments. 

Collateral dependent loans 
 Collateral dependent loans are those for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. These loans do not typically share similar risk characteristics with other loans and expected credit losses are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. Estimates of expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans, whether or not foreclosure is probable, are based on the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for selling costs when repayment depends on sale of the collateral. 
 Troubled debt restructurings 
 For TDRs or loans for which there is a reasonable expectation that a TDR will be executed that are not collateral dependent, the credit loss estimate is determined by comparing the net present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, to the amortized cost basis of the loan. 
 
 Unfunded commitments 
 Expected credit losses related to off-balance sheet credit exposures are estimated over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. Expected credit losses are estimated using essentially the same methodologies employed to estimate expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of loans, taking into consideration the likelihood and amount of additional amounts expected to be funded over the terms of the commitments. The liability for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is presented within other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition, distinct from the ACL. Adjustments to the liability are included in the provision for credit losses. 

k) Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance 

The Company purchases bank owned life insurance on the lives of certain employees. The Company is the beneficiary of the life insurance policies. The cash surrender value of life insurance is reported at the amount that would be received in cash if the polices were surrendered. Increases in the cash value of the policies and proceeds of death benefits received are recorded in noninterest income. The increase in cash surrender value of life insurance is not subject to income taxes, as long as the Company has the intent and ability to hold the policies until the death benefits are received. 
 to years for office properties, three years to years for equipment, and three years for software. 

material impact on the Company's statements of operation or financial condition. 
 
 ASC Topic 848 "Reference Rate Reform." Authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 848, "Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting" provides optional expedients and exceptions for certain contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of rate reform. The guidance is effective from the date of issuance until December 31, 2022. The guidance permits entities to not apply modification accounting or remeasure lease payments in lease contracts if the changes to the contract are related to the discontinuation of the reference rate. If certain criteria are met, the amendments also allow exceptions to the de-designation criteria of the hedging relationship and the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the transition period. The Company believes there will be no material impact on the Company's statements of operation or financial condition. 
 
 Accounting Standards Adopted in 2022 
 
 The Company adopted ASC Topic 326 on January 1, 2022 , and applied the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, as of January 1, 2022 i.e., modified retrospective approach). Upon adoption of the standard, the Company recorded a increase to the allowance for credit losses and million increase to the allowance for unfunded commitments, which resulted in a million after-tax decrease to retained earnings as of January 1, 2022 . The tax effect resulted in a increase to deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company did not record an allowance for AFS securities on January 1, 2022 as the investment portfolio consists primarily of debt securities explicitly or implicitly backed by the U.S. Government for which credit risk is deemed minimal. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. See Note 2 - Securities Available for Sale and Note 3 - Loans Receivable for more information.

The Company reviews the investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to monitor securities in unrealized loss positions, which were comprised of individual securities, to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. In making this evaluation, management considers the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , allowance for credit losses on securities was recognized. The Company does not consider its securities with unrealized losses to be attributable to credit-related factors, as the unrealized losses in each category have occurred as a result of changes in noncredit-related factors such as changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase, not credit deterioration. Furthermore, the Company does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost.

The Company provides several types of loans to its customers, including residential, construction, commercial and consumer loans. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to one borrower or to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. While credit risks tend to be geographically concentrated in the Company s Milwaukee metropolitan area and while of the Company s loan portfolio involves loans that are secured by residential real estate, there are no concentrations with individual or groups of related borrowers. While the real estate collateralizing these loans is primarily residential in nature, it ranges from owner-occupied single family homes to large apartment complexes. 
 
 Qualifying loans receivable totaling million were pledged as collateral against million and million were pledged as collateral against million in outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances under a blanket security agreement at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively. 
 
 Certain of the Company's executive officers, directors, employees, and their related interests have loans with the Bank. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , loans aggregating approximately million and million, respectively, were outstanding to such parties. of these loans were past due or considered impaired as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 .

We currently manage our loan portfolios and the respective exposure to credit losses (credit risk) by the following specific portfolio segments, which are levels at which we develop and document our systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses attributable to each respective portfolio segment. These segments are as follows: 
 
 One- to four -family residential mortgage loans This residential real estate sub-segment contains permanent mortgage loans principally to consumers secured by residential real estate. Residential real estate loans are evaluated for the adequacy of repayment sources at the time of approval, based upon measures including credit scores, debt-to-income ratios and collateral values. Credit risk arises from the borrower s continuing financial stability, which can be adversely impacted by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy, among other factors. Also impacting credit risk would be a shortfall in the value of the residential real estate in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default or subsequent liquidation of the real estate collateral. 
 
 Multi family residential real estate loans Multi family real estate loans consist of multifamily rentals with a history of occupancy and cash flow. This segment includes both internally originated and purchased participation loans. These loans carry the risk of adverse changes in the local economy and a tenant s deteriorating credit strength, lease expirations in soft markets and sustained vacancies, which can adversely impact cash flow. 
 
 Home equity residential mortgage loans This segment includes sub-segment for senior lien and subordinate lien lines of credit. Credit risk is similar to residential real estate loans described above as it is subject to the borrower s continuing financial stability and the value of the collateral securing the loan. 
 
 Construction and land loans Construction and land loans are intended to finance the construction of commercial and residential properties, including the construction of single-family dwellings, and also includes loans for the acquisition and development of land. Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than other residential mortgage lending. The repayment of the construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject property within specified cost limits. The Company completes inspections during the construction phase prior to any disbursements. The Company limits its risk during the construction as disbursements are not made until the required work for each advance has been completed. Construction delays may further impair the borrower s ability to repay the loan. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans Commercial real estate loans consist of non-owner occupied properties, such as investment properties for retail, and office with a history of occupancy and cash flow. This segment includes both internally originated loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties or underlying businesses, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of commercial real estate loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. 
 
 Consumer loans This segment of loans includes primarily installment loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans generally involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the difference in the nature of the underlying collateral. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation in the underlying collateral. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s personal financial stability. As such, these loans are subject to a higher risk of default than the typical consumer loan. 
 
 Commercial business loans Commercial loans are made to provide funds for equipment and general corporate needs, as well as to finance owner-occupied real estate. Repayment of these loans primarily uses the funds obtained from the operation of the borrower s business. Commercial loans also include lines of credit that are utilized to finance a borrower s short-term credit needs and/or to finance a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory. This segment includes both internally originated and purchased participation loans. Credit risk arises from the successful operation of the business, which may be affected by competition, rising interest rates, regulatory changes and adverse conditions in the local and regional economy. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , there were loans that were 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest. 

A summary of the activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 in the allowance for credit losses - loans follows:

1 The Company adopted ASU 2016 - 13 as of January 1, 2022. The prior year amounts presented are calculated under the prior accounting standard. 
 
 The Company utilized the Vintage Loss Rate method in determining expected future credit losses for each of the loan categories except for the Construction and Consumer categories. This technique considers losses over the full life cycle of loan pools. A vintage is a group of loans originated in the same annual time period. The loss rate method measures the amount of loan charge offs, net of recoveries, loan losses recognized over the life of a pool by loan segment and vintage and compares those loan losses to the original loan balance of that pool as of a similar vintage. 
 
 Additionally, the weighted average remaining maturity ("WARM") method is used for the Construction and Consumer loan pools. The WARM method considers an estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the financial assets and uses average annual charge-off rates to estimate the allowance for credit losses. For amortizing assets, the remaining contractual life is adjusted by the expected scheduled payments and prepayments. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the amortization-adjusted remaining life to determine the unadjusted lifetime historical charge-off rate. 
 
 To estimate a CECL loss rate for the pool, management first identifies the loan losses recognized between the pool date and the reporting date for the pool and determines which loan losses were related to loans outstanding at the pool date. The loss rate method then divides the loan losses recognized on loans outstanding as of the pool date by the outstanding loan balance as of the pool date. 
 
 The Company s expected loss estimate is anchored in historical credit loss experience, with an emphasis on all available portfolio data. The Company's historical look back period includes January 2012 through the current period, on an annual basis. When historical credit loss experience is not sufficient for a specific portfolio, the Company may supplement its own portfolio data with external models or data. 
 
 Qualitative reserves reflect management s overall estimate of the extent to which current expected credit losses on collectively evaluated loans will differ from historical loss experience. The analysis takes into consideration other analytics performed within the organization, such as enterprise and concentration management, along with other credit related analytics as deemed appropriate. Management attempts to quantify qualitative reserves whenever possible. The CECL methodology applied focuses on evaluation of qualitative and environmental factors, including but not limited to: (i) evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans; (ii) management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio; (iii) consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio segment; (iv) trends in past due and nonperforming loans; (v) the risk characteristics of the various loan segments; (vi) changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio; (vii) concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries; (viii) existing economic conditions; (ix) the fair value of underlying collateral; and x other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect expected credit losses. 
 
 The Company s CECL estimate applies a forecast that incorporates macroeconomic trends and other environmental factors. Management utilized national, regional and local leading economic indexes, as well as management judgment, as the basis for the forecast period. The historical loss rate was utilized as the base rate, and qualitative adjustments were utilized to reflect the forecast and other relevant factors. 
 
 The Company segments the loan portfolio into pools based on the following risk characteristics: collateral type, credit characteristics, loan origination balance, and outstanding loan balances. 

Allowance for Credit Losses-Unfunded Commitments : 
 In addition to the ACL-Loans, the Company has established an ACL-Unfunded commitments, classified in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. This reserve is maintained at a level that management believes is sufficient to absorb losses arising from unfunded loan commitments, and is determined quarterly based on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the ACL-Loans.

 The provision for credit losses is determined by the Company as the amount to be added to the ACL loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, investment securities, and unfunded commitment credit exposures after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the ACL to a level that, in management's judgment, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. See Note 2 - Securities Available for Sale for additional information regarding the ACL related to investment securities. The following table presents the components of the provision for credit losses.

 Collateral Dependent Loans : 
 A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. For collateral dependent loans, expected credit losses are based on the estimated fair value of the collateral at the balance sheet date, with consideration for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The following tables present collateral dependent loans by portfolio segment and collateral type, including those loans with and without a related allowance allocation.

The Company's procedures dictate that an updated valuation must be obtained with respect to underlying collateral at the time a loan is deemed impaired. Updated valuations may also be obtained upon transfer from loans receivable to real estate owned based upon the age of the prior appraisal, changes in market conditions or known changes to the physical condition of the property. 
 
 Estimated fair values are reduced to account for sales commissions, broker fees, unpaid property taxes and additional selling expenses to arrive at an estimated net realizable value. The adjustment factor is based upon the Company's actual experience with respect to sales of real estate owned over the prior two years. In situations in which we are placing reliance on an appraisal that is more than one year old, an additional adjustment factor is applied to account for downward market pressure since the date of appraisal. The additional adjustment factor is based upon relevant sales data available for our general operating market as well as company-specific historical net realizable values as compared to the most recent appraisal prior to disposition. 
 
 With respect to multi-family income-producing real estate, appraisals are reviewed and estimated collateral values are adjusted by updating significant appraisal assumptions to reflect current real estate market conditions. Significant assumptions reviewed and updated include the capitalization rate, rental income and operating expenses. These adjusted assumptions are based upon recent appraisals received on similar properties as well as on actual experience related to real estate owned and currently under Company management.

Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company establishes a risk rating at origination for all commercial loan and commercial real estate relationships. For relationships over 1.0 million, management monitors the loans on an ongoing basis for any changes in the borrower s ability to service their debt. Factors that are important to managing overall credit quality include sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, an allowance for credit losses, and sound non-accrual and charge-off policies. Our underwriting policies require an officers' loan committee review and approval of all loans in excess of except for residential loans which has an approval limit in excess of 1.0 million. A member of the credit department, independent of the loan originator, performs a loan review for all loans. Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, we maintain a loan review system under which our credit management personnel review non-owner occupied one - to four -family, multi-family, construction and land, and commercial real estate that individually, or as part of an overall borrower relationship exceed million in potential exposure and review commercial loans that individually, or as part of an overall borrower relationship exceed in potential exposure. Loans meeting these criteria are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently, if the loan renewal is less than one year. With respect to this review process, management has determined that pass loans include loans that exhibit acceptable financial statements, cash flow and leverage. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Watch. Loans classified as watch have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Watch assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 
 Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and, additionally, the weakness or weaknesses to make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable or improbable. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.

The following presents data on troubled debt restructurings: 

Commercial real estate

Troubled debt restructurings involve granting concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty by modifying the terms of the loan in an effort to avoid foreclosure. Typical restructured terms include six months to twelve months of principal forbearance, a reduction in interest rate or both. In no instances have the restructured terms included a reduction of outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2022 , in loans had been modified in troubled debt restructurings, all of which were included in the non-accrual total. 
 
 All loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are considered to be impaired. As such, an analysis has been performed with respect to all of these loans to determine the need for an ACL. When a loan is expected to perform in accordance with the restructured terms and ultimately return to and perform under contract terms, a valuation allowance is established equal to the excess of the present value of the expected future cash flows under the original contract terms as compared with the modified terms, including an estimated default rate. When there is doubt as to the borrower s ability to perform under the restructured terms or ultimately return to and perform under market terms, an ACL is established equal to the impairment when the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the underlying collateral. 
 
 If an updated credit department review indicates no other evidence of elevated credit risk and the borrower completes a minimum of consecutive contractual payments, the loan is returned to accrual status at that time.

The short-term repurchase agreement represents the outstanding portion of a total million commitment with one unrelated bank. The short-term repurchase agreement is utilized by Waterstone Mortgage Corporation to finance loans originated for sale. This agreement is secured by the underlying loans being financed. Related interest rates are based upon the note rate associated with the loans being financed. The short-term repurchase agreement had a million balance at December 31, 2022 and a million balance at December 31, 2021 . 
 
 The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. In addition, the Company enters into agreements under which it sells loans held for sale subject to an obligation to repurchase the same loans. Under these arrangements, the Company may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase the assets. As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of assets. The obligation to repurchase the assets is reflected as a liability in the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition, while the securities and loans held for sale underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities and loans held for sale asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities or loans held for sale assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities. The Company's repurchase agreement is subject to master netting agreements, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting agreement, the Company is entitled to set off the collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty.

 The Company selects loans that meet underwriting criteria established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Chicago (FHLBC) as collateral for outstanding advances. The Company s borrowings at the FHLBC are limited to of the carrying value of unencumbered one - to four -family mortgage loans, of the carrying value of home equity loans and of the carrying value of over four -family loans. In addition, these advances are collateralized by FHLBC stock of million at December 31, 2022 and million at December 31, 2021 .

stock options and restricted shares were approved for award. A total of stock options and restricted stock were available to be issued as of December 31, 2022 . 
 
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plan 
 
 The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value of restricted shares is equal to the quoted NASDAQ market closing price on the date of grant. The fair value of stock grants is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. Compensation expense is included in compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted. The weighted average expected life of the stock options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the historical results from the previous awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on the actual volatility of Waterstone Financial, Inc. stock for the weighted average life time period prior to issuance date. The following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of options granted in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 .

million from the Company and purchased shares of common stock of the Company in the open market. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Plan borrowed an additional million from the Company, refinanced the remaining shares (related to the 2005 Plan purchase), and purchased an additional shares of common stock of the Company in the open market. While the shares are not released and allocated to Plan participants until the loan payment is made, the shares are deemed to be earned and are therefore, committed to be released throughout the service period. As such, one - twentieth of the total shares are scheduled to be released annually as shares are earned over a period of 20 years, beginning with the period ended December 31, 2014. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active participant accounts. The shares pledged as collateral are reported as Unearned ESOP shares in the consolidated statement of financial condition. As shares are committed to be released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the average fair market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense attributed to the ESOP was million, million and million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 .

 Under the Internal Revenue Code and Wisconsin Statutes, the Company was permitted to deduct, for tax years beginning before 1988, an annual addition to a reserve for bad debts. This amount differs from the provision for loan losses recorded for financial accounting purposes. Under prior law, bad debt deductions for income tax purposes were included in taxable income of later years only if the bad debt reserves were used for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses. Because the Company did not intend to use the reserve for purposes other than to absorb losses, no deferred income taxes were provided. Retained earnings at December 31, 2022 include approximately million for which no deferred Federal or state income taxes were provided. Deferred income taxes have been provided on certain additions to the tax reserve for bad debts. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and combined state tax returns. One subsidiary also files separate state income tax returns in certain states.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counter-party. Collateral obtained generally consists of mortgages on the underlying real estate. 
 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds mortgages on the underlying real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. 
 
 The Company has determined that there are probable losses related to commitments to extend credit or the standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 . Please see Note 3 - Loans Receivable for discussion on the allowance for credit losses - unfunded commitments. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans sold to others are predominantly conventional residential first lien mortgages. The Company s agreements to sell residential mortgage loans in the normal course of business usually require certain representations and warranties on the underlying loans sold related to credit information, loan documentation and collateral, which if subsequently are untrue or breached, could require the Company to repurchase certain loans affected. The Company has only been required to make insignificant repurchases as a result of breaches of these representations and warranties. The Company s agreements to sell residential mortgage loans also contain limited recourse provisions. The recourse provisions are limited in that the recourse provision ends after certain payment criteria have been met. With respect to these loans, repurchase could be required if defined delinquency issues arose during the limited recourse period. Given that the underlying loans delivered to buyers are predominantly conventional first lien mortgages, historical experience has resulted in insignificant losses and repurchase activity. The Company's reserve for losses related to these recourse provisions that is reported as a component of other liabilities on the Company's consolidated statement of financial condition totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively. 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company, or its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, any liability resulting from pending proceedings would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In determining the fair value of its derivative loan commitments, the Company considers the value that would be generated when the loan arising from exercise of the loan commitment is sold in the secondary mortgage market. That value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for in the secondary mortgage market. The fair value of these commitments is recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition with the changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income. 
 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company's mortgage banking derivatives, including interest rate lock commitments, is the loan pull through rate. This represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which the Company estimates will ultimately close. Generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment will be positively (negatively) impacted when the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment. Generally, an increase in the pull through rate will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock increasing when in a gain position, or decreasing when in a loss position. The pull through rate is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. The pull through rate is computed using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the Company. 
 
 The back-to-back swaps mature in December 2029 to June 2037. Commercial borrower swaps are completed independently with each borrower and are not subject to master netting arrangements. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , back-to-back swaps were in default. The Company pays fixed rates and receives floating rates based upon LIBOR on the swaps with dealer counterparties. Dealer counterparty swaps are subject to master netting agreements among the contracts within our Bank. right of offset existed with dealer counterparty swaps as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in other non-interest income. The Company pledged cash at December 31, 2022 and million in cash at December 31, 2021 . 

Level 2 inputs - Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs use inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets where there are few transactions and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 
 
 Level 3 inputs - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 
 
 In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 
 The following table presents information about our assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statement of financial position at their fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value.

The following summarizes the valuation techniques for assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value on a recurring basis: 
 
 Available for sale securities The Company's investment securities classified as available for sale include: mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, government sponsored enterprise bonds, municipal securities and other debt securities. The fair values of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and government sponsored enterprise bonds are determined by a third party valuation source using observable market data utilizing a matrix or multi-dimensional relational pricing model. Standard inputs to these models include observable market data such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment models and bid/offer market data. For securities with an early redemption feature, an option adjusted spread model is utilized to adjust the issuer spread. These model and matrix measurements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of municipal and other debt securities are determined by a third party valuation source using observable market data utilizing a multi-dimensional relational pricing model. Standard inputs to this model include observable market data such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes, rating updates and issuer spreads. These model measurements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
 Loans held for sale The Company carries loans held for sale at fair value under the fair value option model. Fair value is generally determined by estimating a gross premium or discount, which is derived from pricing currently observable in the secondary market, principally from observable prices for forward sale commitments. Loans held-for-sale are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of income. 
 
 Mortgage banking derivatives - Mortgage banking derivatives include interest rate lock commitments to originate residential loans held for sale to individual customers and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to various investors. The Company utilizes a valuation model to estimate the fair value of its interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, which includes applying a pull through rate based upon historical experience and the current interest rate environment and then multiplying by quoted investor prices. The Company also utilizes a valuation model to estimate the fair value of its forward commitments to sell residential loans, which includes matching specific terms and maturities of the forward commitments against applicable investor pricing available. While there are Level 2 and 3 inputs used in the valuation models, the Company has determined that one or more of the inputs significant in the valuation of both of the mortgage banking derivatives fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of operations, within mortgage banking income. 
 
 Interest rate swap assets/liabilities - The Company offers loan level swaps to its customers and offsets its exposure from such contracts by entering into mirror image swaps with a financial institution / swap counterparty. The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date. Our derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third -party pricing services. Interest rate swap assets and liabilities are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of operations, within other income and other expense.

Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
 
 The following table presents information about our assets recorded in our consolidated statement of financial position at their fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. 

Impaired mortgage servicing rights 

1 Represents collateral-dependent impaired loans, net, which are included in loans. 
 
 Real estate owned On a non-recurring basis, real estate owned is recorded in our consolidated statements of financial condition at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based on third party appraisals and, if less than the carrying value of the foreclosed loan, the carrying value of the real estate owned is adjusted to the fair value. Appraised values are adjusted to consider disposition costs and also to take into consideration the age of the most recent appraisal. Given the significance of the adjustments made to appraised values necessary to estimate the fair value of the properties, real estate owned is considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques. 
 
 Mortgage servicing rights - The Company utilizes an independent valuation from a third party which uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. The model utilizes prepayment assumptions to project cash flows related to the mortgage servicing rights based upon the current interest rate environment, which is then discounted to estimate an expected fair value of the mortgage servicing rights. The model considers characteristics specific to the underlying mortgage portfolio, such as: contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges and costs to service. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs utilized in the estimation process, mortgage servicing rights are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company records the mortgage servicing rights at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 

For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows: Pricing models Pull through rate

A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. 
 
 Fair value information about financial instruments follows, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. 
 
 The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments consist of the following at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 : 

Loans receivable 
 FHLB stock 
 Accrued interest receivable 
 Mortgage servicing rights 
 - 
 Financial Liabilities 
 Deposits 
 Advance payments by borrowers for taxes 
 Borrowings 
 Accrued interest payable 

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in determining its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The carrying amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The commercial paper instruments with a maturity of less than 90 days also approximates its fair value with its carrying value. 
 
 Securities 
 
 The fair value of securities is determined by a third party valuation source using observable market data utilizing a matrix or multi-dimensional relational pricing model. Standard inputs to these models include observable market data such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities and bid/offer market data. For securities with an early redemption feature, an option adjusted spread model is utilized to adjust the issuer spread. Prepayment models are used for mortgage related securities with prepayment features. 
 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 
 Fair value is estimated using the prices of the Company s existing commitments to sell such loans and/or the quoted market price for commitments to sell similar loans. 
 
 Loans Receivable 
 
 The fair value estimation process for the loan portfolio uses an exit price concept and reflects discounts the Company believes are consistent with discounts in the market place. Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as one - to four -family, multi-family, home equity, construction and land, commercial real estate, commercial, and other consumer. The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for similar maturities. The fair value analysis also includes other assumptions to estimate fair value, intended to approximate those a market participant would use in an orderly transaction, with adjustments for discount rates, interest rates, liquidity, and credit spreads, as appropriate. 
 
 FHLB Stock 
 
 For FHLB stock, the carrying amount is the amount at which shares can be redeemed with the FHLB and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 
 Deposits and Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes 
 
 The fair values for interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates of similar remaining maturities to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of the outstanding certificates of deposit. The advance payments by borrowers for taxes are equal to their carrying amounts at the reporting date. 
 
 Borrowings 
 
 Fair values for borrowings are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to estimated future cash flows of the borrowings. 
 
 Accrued Interest Payable and Accrued Interest Receivable 
 
 For accrued interest payable and accrued interest receivable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 
 Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit 
 
 Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are generally not marketable. Furthermore, interest rates on any amounts drawn under such commitments would be generally established at market rates at the time of the draw. Fair values for the Company's commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements, the counterparty's credit standing, and discounted cash flow analyses. The fair value of the Company's commitments to extend credit was not material at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . 

Mortgage Banking Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
 
 Mortgage banking derivatives include interest rate lock commitments to originate residential loans held for sale to individual customers and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to various investors. The Company relies on a valuation model to estimate the fair value of its interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, which includes applying a pull through rate based upon historical experience and the current interest rate environment, and then multiplying by quoted investor prices. The Company also relies on a valuation model to estimate the fair value of its forward commitments to sell residential loans, which includes matching specific terms and maturities of the forward commitments against applicable investor pricing available. On the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition, instruments that have a positive fair value are included in prepaid expenses and other assets, and those instruments that have a negative fair value are included in other liabilities. 
 
 Interest Rate Swap Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The carrying value and fair value of existing derivative financial instruments are based upon independent valuation models, which use widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative contract. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
