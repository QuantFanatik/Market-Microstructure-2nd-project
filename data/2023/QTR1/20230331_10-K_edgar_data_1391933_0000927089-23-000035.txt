Paycheck Protection Program . The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration SBA to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). As a qualified SBA lender, we were automatically authorized to originate PPP loans and chose to participate. Since March 2020, the Company has continued to work diligently to help support its existing and new customers through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), loan modifications, loan deferrals and fee waivers. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act became law. The Economic Aid Act opened a new PPP loan period for first loans and implemented a second loan draw for certain PPP borrowers, each through May 31, 2021. Under the first round, the Company funded 854 PPP loans totaling 95.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, 854 of these first round PPP loans totaling 95.1 million were forgiven under the SBA forgiveness program. Under the second round of PPP the Company funded 985 PPP loans totaling 88.4 million. As of December 31, 2022, 981 of the second round PPP loans totaling 88.2 million have been forgiven under the SBA forgiveness program. The Company recognized approximately 1.1 million and 4.4 million of deferred loan fees amortization related to PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility . The CARES Act also allocated a limited amount of funds to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) with a broad mandate to provide liquidity to eligible businesses, states or municipalities in light of COVID-19. On April 9, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced several new or expanded lending programs to provide relief for businesses and governments. One of these programs was the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF). Under the PPPLF, all depository institutions that originate PPP loans are eligible to borrow on a non-recourse basis from their regional Federal Reserve Bank using SBA PPP loans as collateral. The principal amount of loans will be equal to the PPP loans pledged as collateral. There are no fees associated with these loans and the interest rate is 35 basis points. The maturity date of PPPLF loans will be the same as the maturity date of the PPP loans pledged as collateral. The PPPLF loan maturity date will be accelerated if the underlying PPP loan goes into default and the lender sells the PPP loan to the SBA under the SBA guarantee. The PPPLF loan maturity date also will be accelerated for any loan forgiveness reimbursement received by the lender from the SBA.

In April 2020, the Bank received approval to borrow from the FRB under the PPPLF program to assist in funding PPP loans. Through December 31, 2021, the Bank used the FRB program to fund 52.1 million of PPP loans. The Bank paid off approximately 48.2 million of PPP loans pledged as collateral under the PPPLF program and had no outstanding advances with the FRB at December 31, 2022. Through December 31, 2022 the Bank has not used the PPPLF program to fund any round two PPP loans.

Loan Modifications/Troubled Debt Restructurings . Under the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring TDR ), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Financial institutions wishing to utilize this authority must make a policy election, which applies to any COVID-19 modification made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of either January 1, 2022 or the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. Quaint Oak Bank has made that election. Similarly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief will not be considered TDRs.

Prior to the enactment of the CARES Act, the banking regulatory agencies provided guidance as to how certain short-term modifications would not be considered TDRs, and have subsequently confirmed that such guidance could be applicable for loans that do not qualify for favorable accounting treatment under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.

3

The Bank addresses loan payment modification requests on a case-by-case basis considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, related economic slow-down and stay-at-home orders on our customer and their current and projected cash flows through the term of the loan. Through December 31, 2022, the Bank modified 231 loans with principal balances totaling 90.6 million representing approximately 21.9 of our December 31, 2022 loan balances. A majority of deferrals are two-month payment deferrals of principal and interest, with payments after deferral increased to collect amounts deferred. In some cases, certain loans were granted additional deferrals. As of December 31, 2022, there are no loans that are still on deferral.

Quaint Oak Bank s Lending Activities 

General. At December 31, 2022, the net loan portfolio of Quaint Oak Bank amounted to 621.9 million, representing approximately 78.4 of its total assets at that date. The principal lending activity of Quaint Oak Bank is the origination of commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and one-to-four family residential non-owner occupied loans, and to a lesser extent, multi-family residential loans, construction loans, one-to-four family residential owner occupied loans, and home equity loans. At December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans amounted to 333.5 million, or 52.9 of its total loan portfolio. Commercial business loans totaled 159.1 million, or 25.2 , of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, one-to-four family residential loans amounted to 57.4 million or 9.1 of its total loan portfolio of which 39.3 million, or 6.2 , of the total loan portfolio consisted of non-owner occupied properties and 18.1 million, or 2.9 , of the total loan portfolio consisted of owner occupied properties.

Home equity loans totaled 4.9 million, or 0.8 , of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022.

The types of loans that Quaint Oak Bank may originate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. Interest rates charged on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by our competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions, the monetary policy of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative and tax policies, and governmental budgetary matters.

Quaint Oak Bank is subject to a regulatory loans to one borrower limit of 15 of the Bank s capital which amounts to 6.6 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank s five largest loans or groups of loans-to-one borrower, including related entities, were 6.4 million, 6.3 million, 6.0 million, 6.0 million, and 5.8 million.

Origination of Loans. The lending activities of Quaint Oak Bank are subject to the written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors and management. New loans are generated primarily through the efforts of Quaint Oak Bank s loan officers, referrals from brokers and existing customers. Loan applications are underwritten and processed by Quaint Oak Bank s credit administration department.

All loans are presented to the loan committee for review. Quaint Oak Bank s loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. Individual loan requests over 1.5 million, or loan requests that would increase the relationship over 1.5 million, must be approved by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President Business Development, and one outside loan committee member.

The following table shows our total loans originated and repaid during the periods indicated. Included in the loan originations for commercial real estate loans was the purchase of a 55.5 million loan portfolio by the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oakmont Commercial, LLC, in April, 2022.

Scheduled contractual maturities of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual expected term of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when rates on current mortgage loans are lower than existing mortgage loan rates (due to refinancing of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans at lower rates). Under the latter circumstance, the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates.

One-to-Four Family Residential Owner Occupied Real Estate Loans. As part of our strategy of diversifying our loan portfolio with higher yielding and shorter-term loan products, Quaint Oak Bank does not actively market the origination of one-to-four family owner occupied residential loans to be held in our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, 18.1 million, or 2.9 , of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of one-to-four family owner occupied residential loans.

One-to-Four Family Residential Non-Owner Occupied Real Estate Loans. A significant part of Quaint Oak Bank s lending activity is the origination of loans secured by single-family residences for non-owner occupied properties. As part of our strategy of diversifying our loan portfolio with higher yielding and shorter-term loan products, Quaint Oak Bank does not actively market the origination of one-to-four family residential non-owner occupied real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 39.3 million, or 6.2 , of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of one-to-four family residential non-owner occupied loans.

It is our policy to lend in a first lien position on non-owner occupied residential property with fixed and variable rates and terms generally up to 15 years or longer amortizations. Generally, such loans are originated with a three or five year maturity. Such loans are generally limited to 75 , or less, of the appraised value, or sales price plus improvement costs of the secured real estate property.

One-to-Four Family Residential Loans Originated for Sale. Quaint Oak Bank through its subsidiary, Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC, originates one-to-four family residential fixed and variable rate first mortgages with amortizing terms less than or equal to 30 years in accordance with secondary market standards. Loans originated by Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC are sold into the secondary market along with the loans servicing rights. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC originated 118.4 million of owner and non-owner occupied residential loans for sale and sold 132.9 million of these loans in the secondary market. For the year ended December 31, 2021, loans originated for sale through Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC totaled 225.7 million and 261.5 million of these loans were sold in the secondary market.

Multi-Family Residential Loans. Quaint Oak Bank originates loans for multi-unit (five or more) residential properties. These loans are offered with fixed and adjustable interest rates and amortizations not to exceed 25 years. Generally, the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 75 . These loans are underwritten with the same criteria and procedures as commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 46.9 million, or 7.4 , of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

7

Commercial Real Estate Loans. Quaint Oak Bank also originates loans secured by commercial real estate. At December 31, 2022, 333.5 million, or 52.9 of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of commercial real estate loans. Although commercial real estate loans are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we intend to continue to originate such loans in our market area. At December 31, 2022, approximately 36 of total commercial real estate loans were owner occupied. Contributing to the increase in commercial real estate loans was the purchase of a 55.5 million loan portfolio by the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oakmont Commercial, LLC, in April, 2022.

It is generally our policy to lend in a first lien position on real property occupied as a commercial business property or mixed use properties. However, in rare instances, we may take a second lien position if approved by the loan committee. Quaint Oak Bank offers fixed and variable rate mortgage loans with amortization not to exceed 25 years. Commercial real estate loans are limited to 70 , or less, of the appraised value, or sales price plus improvement costs of the secured real estate property. Commercial real estate loans are presented to the loan committee for review and approval, including analysis of the creditworthiness of the borrower. The loan committee reviews the cash flows from the property to determine if the proceeds will adequately cover debt service. Quaint Oak Bank uses a Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of 1.20. We require the collection of various documents to verify income, including personal tax returns, business tax returns, and copies of current leases. Assignments of rents and leases as well as the requirement to provide annual updates of financial information and rent rolls are included in the loan documentation.

Construction Loans. Our construction loans are generally originated for the purpose of building or renovating a single family residential home. Generally, we do not make construction loans for speculative development. Funds are advanced incrementally as work is completed. The borrower is required to make monthly interest payments. When the construction is finished, the amount of the outstanding loan is generally less than 70 of the completed value of the property. Quaint Oak Bank is paid in full when the borrower seeks permanent financing or the property is sold. At December 31, 2022, 28.9 million, or 4.6 of Quaint Oak Bank s total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of construction loans.

Home Equity Loans. Quaint Oak Bank is authorized to make loans for a wide variety of personal or consumer purposes. Quaint Oak Bank originates home equity lines of credit in order to accommodate its customers and because such loans generally have shorter terms than residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2022, 4.9 million, or 0.8 of Quaint Oak Bank s total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of home equity loans.

Commercial Business Loans. Quaint Oak Bank originates loans to businesses for working capital, purchase of a business, tenant improvements, receivables, purchase of inventory, and for the purchase of business essential equipment. Business essential equipment is equipment necessary for a business to support or assist with the day-to-day operation or profitability of the business. At December 31, 2022, 159.1 million, or 25.2 of Quaint Oak Bank s total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of commercial business loans. At December 31, 2022, commercial business loans include 213,000 of SBA PPP loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Bank originated 403.2 million in equipment loans held for sale and sold 343.9 million of equipment loans. Also contributing to the decrease in loans held for sale at December 31, 2022 is 19.4 million of loan amortization and prepayments. Additionally, the Bank s mortgage banking subsidiary, Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC, originated 118.4 million of one-to-four family residential loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 and sold 132.9 million of loans in the secondary market during this same period.

8

Other Consumer Loans. Quaint Oak Bank originates loans secured by savings accounts in order to accommodate its existing customers. At December 31, 2022, 2,000 of Quaint Oak Bank s total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of other consumer loans.

Loan Origination and Other Fees. In addition to interest earned on loans, Quaint Oak Bank generally receives loan origination fees or points for originating loans. Loan points are a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and are charged to the borrower in connection with the origination of the loan. Such origination fees, net of certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the yield (interest income) of the related loans over the contractual life of the loans.

Asset Quality 

General. Quaint Oak Bank s collection procedures provide that when a loan is 17 days past due, a telephone call is made to the borrower by our collections specialist to determine the reason for the delinquency and to work out a possible solution. Late charges will be assessed based on the number of days specified in the note beyond the due date. The Board of Directors is notified of all delinquencies 30 days past due. In most cases, deficiencies are cured promptly. While we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems, we will institute foreclosure or other collection proceedings when necessary to minimize any potential loss.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes the probability of collection of interest is doubtful. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. Quaint Oak Bank generally discontinues the accrual of interest income when the loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless the credit is well secured and we believe we will fully collect. There were 1.9 million and 9,000 of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Real estate and other assets acquired by Quaint Oak Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are classified as real estate owned until sold. There was no other real estate owned as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2022, we had two loans totaling 136,000 that were identified as troubled debt restructurings TDR ), both of which were performing in accordance with their modified terms. If a TDR is placed on non-accrual it is not reverted back to accruing status until the borrower makes timely payments as contracted for at least six months and future collection under the revised terms is probable.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations require that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a higher possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. Another category designated special mention also must be established and maintained for assets which do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard, doubtful or loss. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general allowances for loan losses. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the insured institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100 of the portion of the asset classified loss, or charge-off such amount. General loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital, while specific valuation allowances for loan losses do not qualify as regulatory capital. Federal examiners may disagree with an insured institution s classifications and amounts reserved.

Allowance for Loan Losses. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank s allowance for loan losses amounted to 7.7 million. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.

While management believes that it determines the amount of the allowance based on the best information available at the time, the allowance will need to be adjusted as circumstances change and assumptions are updated. Future adjustments to the allowance could significantly affect net income.

The following table shows changes in our allowance for loan losses during the periods presented.

The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These loss factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment. Residential mortgage lending generally entails a lower risk of default than other types of lending. Consumer loans and commercial real estate loans generally involve more risk of collectability because of the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. It is our policy to establish a specific reserve for loss on any delinquent loan when we determine that a loss is probable. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.

Investment Activities 

General. We invest in securities pursuant to our investment policy, which has been approved by our Board of Directors. Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO). All policy changes recommended by ALCO must be approved by the Board of Directors. ALCO is authorized by the Board to make investments consistent with the investment policy. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by ALCO, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer and the President and Chief Executive Officer.

Our investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity.

Our securities are classified as available for sale, held to maturity, or trading, at the time of acquisition. Securities classified as held to maturity must be purchased with the intent and ability to hold that security until its final maturity and can be sold prior to maturity only under rare circumstances. Held to maturity securities are accounted for based upon the amortized cost of the security. Available for sale securities can be sold at any time based upon our needs or market conditions. Available for sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income tax provisions, reflected in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2022, we had 3.0 million of securities classified as available for sale and no securities classified as held to maturity or trading.

The Company also invests excess liquidity in interest-earning time deposits with other banks, laddering the maturities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held 3.8 million in interest-earning time deposits.

Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock is a restricted investment security, carried at cost. The purchase of FHLB stock provides banks with the right to be a member of the FHLB and to receive the products and services that the FHLB provides to member banking institutions. Unlike other types of stock, FHLB stock is acquired primarily for the right to receive advances from the FHLB, rather than for the purpose of maximizing dividends or stock growth. FHLB stock is an activity-based stock that is directly proportional to the volume of advances taken by a member institution. The FHLB will repurchase capital stock at 1.00 per share from Quaint Oak Bank. The FHLB has paid dividends on the capital stock in each quarter of 2022 and 2021.

Sources of Funds 

General. Deposits are the primary source of Quaint Oak Bank s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, principal and interest payments on loans are a source of funds. Loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may also be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources and on a longer-term basis for general business purposes.

Deposits. Deposits are attracted by Quaint Oak Bank principally from Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania, and the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, although we also attract deposits from outside our market area and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. Quaint Oak Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of certificates of deposit, money market and other savings products, including non-interest bearing business and consumer checking accounts. Quaint Oak Bank generally does not solicit deposits from outside Pennsylvania or pay fees to brokers to solicit funds for deposit, however the Bank does use a listing service for certificates of deposit, and has a deposit placement agreement with a third party bank for money market accounts. At December 31, 2022, approximately 50.8 of Quaint Oak Bank s total deposits were held by customers outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Management determines the rates and terms based on rates paid by competitors, the need for funds or liquidity, growth goals and federal regulations. Management attempts to control the flow of deposits by pricing the accounts to remain generally competitive with other financial institutions in our market area.

Borrowings. Quaint Oak Bank may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh upon the security of the common stock it owns in that bank and certain of its residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed and other investment securities, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. These advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are generally available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to permit increased lending.

As of December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank has a maximum borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of approximately 353.4 million. Quaint Oak Bank s Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding were 159.2 million and 49.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank has 8.1 million in borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia under the discount window program. Quaint Oak Bank borrowed 7.0 million from the FRB discount window as of December 31, 2022. There were no borrowings under the discount window as of December 31, 2021. 

As of December 31, 2022, there was 5.5 million of other short-term borrowings representing balances on two lines of credit that Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC has with a credit union. Borrowing capacity on the two lines of credit total 15.0 million at December 31, 2022.

Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings increased to 7.0 million at December 31, 2022 from 3.9 million at December 31, 2021 as the Company paid off 3.9 million of first round PPP loans pledged as collateral under the FRB s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF) and borrowed 7.0 million from the FRB discount window. Under the PPPLF the Company pledged certain PPP loans as collateral and borrowed from the Federal Reserve at a rate of 0.35 that is fixed for two years. These borrowings are paid off as the PPP loans pledged as collateral are forgiven through the SBA PPP loan forgiveness program.

Total Employees 

We had 129 full-time employees and no part-time employees at December 31, 2022. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that the Company enjoys good relations with its personnel.

Market Area 

As of December 31, 2022, our primary market area for loans and deposits is in Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania, and the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, although we also attract deposits from outside our market area and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Our operating strategy is based on strong personal service and operating efficiency.

Quaint Oak Bank is headquartered in Southampton in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and operates through its main office and two regional offices located in the Lehigh Valley and Philadelphia markets. The Bank opened its second regional office in Philadelphia on February 26, 2020. Bucks County lies north of Philadelphia, bordering Montgomery County on the west and New Jersey to the east. In recent years, population growth has been above Pennsylvania averages in both Bucks and Montgomery Counties. We expect population growth and new housing growth will likely remain above the state average in the near term. Income and wealth demographics are also above both national and Pennsylvania averages. The Lehigh Valley area is one of the fastest growing regions in Pennsylvania due in part to its reasonable business climate and lower cost of living in comparison to its surrounding areas and states. The Lehigh Valley is particularly noteworthy for its unusually balanced and multi-faceted economy. Far from depending on a single industry, the top four sub-sectors of the regional GDP are all extremely close to one another, which ultimately means a healthier and more vibrant regional economy. Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the sixth most populous city in the United States. Philadelphia's diverse economic sectors include higher education, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, health care and biotechnology, telecommunications, tourism and financial services. Our Philadelphia regional office establishes a physical commitment to support the Company s already significant productivity in the Philadelphia market.

Competition 

Quaint Oak Bank faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Its most direct competition for deposits has come historically from commercial banks, credit unions and other savings institutions located in its primary market area, including many large financial institutions which have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, Quaint Oak Bank faces significant competition for investors funds from short-term money market securities, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Also, given Quaint Oak Bank s operating strategies and reliance on savings accounts and certificates of deposit, Quaint Oak Bank also faces intense competition from money market mutual funds and national savings products. Quaint Oak Bank does not rely upon any individual group or entity for a material portion of its deposits, with the exception of using a listing agent for certificates of deposit. The ability of Quaint Oak Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.

Quaint Oak Bank s competition for loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, other savings institutions and credit unions. Quaint Oak Bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges, and the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers. Factors that affect competition include general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and volatility in the mortgage markets.

REGULATION 

Regulation of Quaint Oak Bancorp 

General. Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, because we made an election under Section 10(l) of the Home Owners Loan Act to be treated as a savings association for purposes of Section 10 of the Home Owners Loan Act. Quaint Oak Bancorp is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to the regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements relating to savings and loan holding companies. Quaint Oak Bancorp is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Quaint Oak Bank is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with Quaint Oak Bancorp and affiliates thereof, including the Federal Reserve Board s Qualified Thrift Lender test, dividend restrictions and transactions with affiliates regulations.

In the last several years, Quaint Oak Bancorp has experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ). Resulting reforms have caused Quaint Oak Bancorp s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase.

18

2018 Regulatory Reform. In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the Act ), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than 50 billion.

The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8 and 10 percent to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from 1.0 billion to 3.0 billion. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.

Restrictions Applicable to Quaint Oak Bancorp. As a non-grandfathered savings and loan holding company, Quaint Oak Bancorp is permitted to engage only in the following activities:

furnishing or performing management services for a subsidiary savings institution;

conducting an insurance agency or escrow business;

holding, managing, or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a subsidiary savings institution;

holding or managing properties used or occupied by a subsidiary savings institution;

acting as trustee under a deed of trust;

any other activity (i) that the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, unless the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies, or (ii) in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized by regulation to directly engage in on March 5, 1987;

purchasing, holding, or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such holding company is approved by the Federal Reserve Board; and

any activity permissible for financial holding companies under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act.

19

Permissible activities which are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental thereto under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act include:

lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities;

insurance activities or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker;

financial, investment, or economic advisory services;

issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets that a bank is permitted to hold directly;

underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities;

activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking;

activities that bank holding companies are permitted to engage in outside of the U.S.; and

portfolio investments made by an insurance company.

In addition, Quaint Oak Bancorp cannot be acquired unless the acquirer is engaged solely in financial activities or acquire a company unless the company is engaged solely in financial activities.

If a savings and loan holding company acquires or merges with another holding company, the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in the activities listed above, and it has a period of two years to cease any non-conforming activities and divest any non-conforming investments. As of December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bancorp was not engaged in any non-conforming activities and it did not have any non-conforming investments.

If the subsidiary savings association fails to meet the Qualified Thrift Lender test set forth in Section 10(m) of the Home Owners Loan Act, as discussed below, then the savings and loan holding company must register with the Federal Reserve Board as a bank holding company, unless the savings institution requalifies as a Qualified Thrift Lender within one year thereafter.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. A savings association can comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test by either meeting the Qualified Thrift Lender test set forth in the Home Owners Loan Act and implementing regulations or qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Currently the Qualified Thrift Lender test in the Home Owners Loan Act requires that 65 of an institution s portfolio assets (as defined) consist of certain housing and consumer-related assets on a monthly average basis in nine out of every twelve months. To be a Qualified Thrift Lender under the IRS test, the savings institution must meet the business operations test and a 60 percent assets test , each defined in the Internal Revenue Code. A savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company that does not comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test is immediately subject to the following restrictions on its operations:

the institution may not engage in any new activity or make any new investment, directly or indirectly, unless such activity or investment is permissible for both a national bank and a savings association;

20

the branching powers of the institution shall be restricted to those of a national bank; and

payment of dividends by the institution shall be subject to the rules regarding payment of dividends by a national bank and must be necessary to meet the obligations of its holding company.

Upon the expiration of three years from the date the institution ceases to meet the Qualified Thrift Lender test, it must cease any activity and not retain any investment not permissible for both a national bank and a savings association (subject to safety and soundness considerations). A savings institution not in compliance with the Qualified Thrift Lender test is also subject to an enforcement action for violation of the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended.

Quaint Oak Bank believes that it meets the provisions of the Qualified Thrift Lender test and for the year ended December 31, 2022, 67 of its portfolio assets meet the requirements.

Regulatory Capital Requirements . The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a savings and loan holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board s capital adequacy guidelines for Quaint Oak Bancorp, on a consolidated basis, are similar to those imposed on Quaint Oak Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. See -Regulation of Quaint Oak Bank - Capital Requirements. Moreover, certain of the savings and loan holding company capital requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 became effective as of January 1, 2015. Those requirements establish four minimum capital ratios that Quaint Oak Bancorp had to comply with as of that date. However, in May 2015, amendments to the Federal Reserve Board s small bank holding company policy statement (the SBHC Policy (which also applies to small savings and loan holding companies) became effective which increased the asset threshold to qualify to utilize the provisions of the SBHC Policy from 500 million to 1.0 billion. In 2018, the Act increased the asset threshold to 3.0 billion. Savings and loan holding companies which are subject to the SBHC Policy are not subject to compliance with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in the table below until they exceed 3.0 billion in assets. As a consequence, as of December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bancorp was not required to comply with the requirements until such time that its consolidated total assets exceed 3.0 billion or the Federal Reserve Board determines that Quaint Oak Bancorp is no longer deemed to be a small savings and loan holding company. However, if Quaint Oak Bancorp had been subject to the requirements, it would have been in compliance with such requirements.

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners Loan Act. An affiliate of a savings association includes any company or entity which controls the savings association or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings association. In a holding company context, the holding company of a savings association (such as Quaint Oak Bancorp) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the savings association. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such association s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings association as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings association to an affiliate. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, Section 11 of the Home Owners Loan Act prohibits a savings association from (i) making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate, except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association.

21

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners Loan Act, place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders of the savings association and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10 stockholder of a savings association, and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the savings association s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15 of the association s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the association and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the savings association. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a savings association to all insiders cannot exceed the association s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. As an insured state-chartered savings bank, Quaint Oak Bank currently is subject to Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and at December 31, 2022, was in compliance with the above restrictions.

Restrictions on Acquisitions . Except under limited circumstances, savings and loan holding companies are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, (i) control of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company or substantially all the assets thereof or (ii) more than 5 of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof which is not a subsidiary. Except with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, no director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than 25 of such company s stock, may acquire control of any savings association, other than a subsidiary savings association, or of any other savings and loan holding company.

The Federal Reserve Board may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state if (i) the multiple savings and loan holding company involved controls a savings association which operated a home or branch office located in the state of the association to be acquired as of March 5, 1987; (ii) the acquirer is authorized to acquire control of the savings association pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or (iii) the statutes of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit associations to be acquired by the state-chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located (or by a holding company that controls such state-chartered savings associations).

Federal Securities Laws . Quaint Oak Bancorp s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act . As a public company, Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

Volcker Rule Regulations. Regulations have been adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. Federal regulations exclude from the Volcker Rule restrictions community banks with 10 billion or less in total consolidated and total trading assets and liabilities of five percent or less of total consolidated assets. Quaint Oak qualifies for the exclusion from Volcker Rule restrictions.

Regulation of Quaint Oak Bank 

Pennsylvania Banking Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of Quaint Oak Bank and its affairs. The Pennsylvania Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices.

One of the purposes of the Pennsylvania Banking Code is to provide savings banks with the opportunity to be competitive with each other and with other financial institutions existing under other Pennsylvania laws and other state, federal and foreign laws. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in the Commonwealth, with the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.

The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities may accept the examinations and reports of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in lieu of its own examination, the present practice is for the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities to conduct individual examinations. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, trustee, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities why such person should not be removed.

Insurance of Accounts. The deposits of Quaint Oak Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The 2010 financial institution reform legislation permanently increased deposit insurance on most accounts to 250,000. As insurer, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

23

The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on the assessment base of a depository institution, which is its average total assets reduced by the amount of its average tangible equity. For a small institution (one with assets of less than 10 billion) that has been federally insured for at least five years, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 3 to 30 basis points, based on the institution s CAMELS composite and component ratings and certain financial ratios; its leverage ratio; its ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; its ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to gross assets; its ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets; its brokered deposits ratio (excluding reciprocal deposits if the institution is well capitalized and has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2); its one year asset growth ratio (which penalizes growth adjusted for mergers in excess of 10 ); and its loan mix index (which penalizes higher risk loans based on historical industry charge off rates). The initial base assessment rate is subject to downward adjustment (not below 1.5 based on the ratio of unsecured debt the institution has issued to its assessment base, and to upward adjustment (which can cause the rate to exceed 30 basis points) based on its holdings of unsecured debt issued by other insured institutions.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including Quaint Oak Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of Quaint Oak Bank s deposit insurance.

Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent as of June 30, 2020. In September 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board of Directors adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to update its analysis and projections for the deposit insurance fund balance and reserve ratio at least semiannually.

In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve ratio. Based on this update, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions.

In October 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028.

Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.

24

At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank s capital exceeded all applicable capital requirements. See Note 18 to the notes to our financial statements included in Exhibit 13.0 hereto.

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets e.g. , recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.

The FASB adopted a new credit loss accounting standard applicable to all banks, savings banks, credit unions, and financial holding companies, regardless of size and is effective for Quaint Oak Bank for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2023. The final rule allows for an optional three-year phase in of the day-one adverse effects on a bank s regulatory capital. This Current Expected Credit Loss CECL standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses.

The Act required the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 and 10 for institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. Quaint Oak Bank has not utilized the community bank leverage ratio.

Any savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement action by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such action could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s capital regulations provide that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.

Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities Capital Requirements . Quaint Oak Bank is also subject to more stringent Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities capital guidelines. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities utilizes capital standards requiring a minimum of 6 leverage capital and 10 risk-based capital. The components of leverage and risk-based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank s tier 1 leverage ratio was well capitalized and total risk-based capital was adequately capitalized.

25

Prompt Corrective Action . The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations.

Capital Category

Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital

Less than 3 

In addition, an institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).

An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions.

At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank was deemed an adequately-capitalized institution for purposes of the prompt corrective regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions.

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Savings Banks. The activities and equity investments of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured, state-chartered savings banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things:

acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary;

investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2 of the bank s total assets;

26

acquiring up to 10 of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors , trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and

acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted regulations pertaining to the other activity restrictions imposed upon insured state banks and their subsidiaries. Pursuant to such regulations, insured state banks engaging in impermissible activities may seek approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to continue such activities. State banks not engaging in such activities but that desire to engage in otherwise impermissible activities either directly or through a subsidiary may apply for approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to do so; however, if such bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirements or the activities present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, such application will not be approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Pursuant to this authority, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that investments in certain majority-owned subsidiaries of insured state banks do not represent a significant risk to the deposit insurance funds. Investments permitted under that authority include real estate activities and securities activities.

Brokered Deposits. A "brokered deposit" is any deposit that is obtained from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker. Deposit brokers may attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the United States and internationally whose deposit decisions are based primarily on obtaining the highest interest rates. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations limit the ability of an insured depository institution, such as Quaint Oak Bank, to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits unless the institution is well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described above, or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, less than well-capitalized banks are subject to restrictions on the interest rates they may pay on deposits. The characterization of deposits as "brokered" may result in the imposition of higher deposit assessments on such deposits. As mandated by the Economic Growth Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a final rule in February 2019 to include a limited exception for reciprocal deposits for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured depository institutions that are well-rated and well-capitalized (or adequately capitalized and for which the insured depository institution has obtained a waiver from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.). Certain reciprocal deposits of up to the lesser of 5 billion or 20 of an insured depository institution s deposits are excluded from the definition of brokered deposits, where the insured depository institution is "well-capitalized" and has a composite rating of 1 or 2.

In December 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a final rule amending its brokered deposits regulation. The rule sought to clarify and modernize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s regulatory framework for brokered deposits. Notable aspects of the rule included (i) the establishment of bright-line standards for determining whether an entity meets the statutory definition of "deposit broker;" (ii) the identification of a number of business relationships in which the agent or nominee is automatically not deemed to be a "deposit broker" because their primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions (the "primary purpose exception"); (iii) the establishment of a "more transparent" application process for entities that seek to rely upon the "primary purpose exception", but do not qualify for one of the identified business relationships to which the exception is automatically applicable; and (iv) the clarification that third parties that have an exclusive deposit-placement arrangement with one insured depository institution are not considered a "deposit broker." The final rule took effect on April 1, 2021, and full compliance was required by January 1, 2022.

27

Restrictions on Capital Distributions. Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations govern capital distributions by savings institutions, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution to make capital distributions. These regulations apply to Quaint Oak Bancorp because Quaint Oak Bank is considered a savings association for certain purposes under Home Owners Loan Act, as amended. Under applicable regulations, a savings association must file an application for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval of the capital distribution if:

the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution s net income for that year to date plus the institution s retained net income for the preceding two years;

the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;

the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-imposed condition; or

the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

If an application is not required to be filed, state savings banks that elect to be treated as savings associations such as Quaint Oak Bank must still file a notice with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution if either (1) the institution would not be well-capitalized following the distribution; or (2) the proposed distribution would reduce the amount or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any part of a debt instrument included in its regulatory capital. In addition, a savings institution, such as Quaint Oak Bank, that is the subsidiary of a stock saving and loan holding company, must also file a notice with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of a dividend by its board of directors.

A savings association that either before or after a proposed capital distribution fails to meet its then applicable minimum capital requirement or that has been notified that it needs more than normal supervision may not make any capital distributions without the prior written approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Quaint Oak Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentration Guidance. Under guidance issued by the federal banking agencies, the agencies have expressed concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards and have directed financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks. The agencies have also issued guidance that requires a financial institution to employ enhanced risk management practices if the institution is exposed to significant concentration risk in its commercial real estate portfolio. Under that guidance, an institution is potentially exposed to significant concentration risk if: (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 or more of total risk-based capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land development, and other land loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300 or more of total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the prior 36 months. At December 31, 2022, the balance of these real estate loans represented 679.6 of Quaint Oak Bank s total capital and our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by 179.5 during the preceding 36 months. Institutions, which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital.

28

Privacy Requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Federal law places limitations on financial institutions like Quaint Oak Bank regarding the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, these provisions require all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Quaint Oak Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes such policy is in compliance with the regulations.

Consumer Financial Services . The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly with the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB as part of the Dodd-Frank Act reforms. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including Quaint Oak Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than 10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with 10 billion or less in assets, like Quaint Oak Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.

Anti-Money Laundering. Federal anti-money laundering rules impose various requirements on financial institutions intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. These provisions include a requirement that financial institutions operating in the United States have anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Quaint Oak Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti-laundering provisions.

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. The federal banking laws provide substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.

Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in restrictions on its activities. Quaint Oak Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.

29

Federal Home Loan Bank System. Quaint Oak Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank.

As a member, Quaint Oak Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh in an amount in accordance with the Federal Home Loan Bank s capital plan and sufficient to ensure that the Federal Home Loan Bank remains in compliance with its minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank was in compliance with this requirement.

Federal Reserve Board System. The Federal Reserve Board requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, which are primarily checking and NOW accounts, and non-personal time deposits. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy the liquidity requirements that are imposed by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.

TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

General. Quaint Oak Bancorp and Quaint Oak Bank are subject to federal income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below. For federal income tax purposes, Quaint Oak Bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly owned subsidiaries on a fiscal year basis. The applicable federal income tax expense or benefit will be properly allocated to each entity based upon taxable income or loss calculated on a separate company basis.

Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, income and expenses are reported on the accrual method of accounting and Quaint Oak Bancorp files its federal income tax return using a December 31 fiscal year end.

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Job Protection Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if a savings bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. New federal legislation eliminated these thrift related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to recapture should a savings bank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a savings bank charter. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank did not have federal pre-1988 reserves subject to recapture.

Corporate Dividends Received Deduction. Quaint Oak Bancorp may exclude from income 100 of dividends received from a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80 in the case of dividends received from corporations, which a corporate recipient owns less than 80 , but at least 20 of the distribution corporation. Corporations that own less than 20 of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70 of dividends received.

30

Other Matters. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for the years before January 1, 2019.

State and Local Taxation 

Pennsylvania Taxation. Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for 2022 is 9.99 and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments.

Quaint Oak Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act (the MTIT ), as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the MTIT, the tax rate is 11.5 . The MTIT exempts Quaint Oak Bank from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The MTIT is a tax upon net earnings, determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The MTIT, in computing income under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of thrift s interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of Quaint Oak Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter can be carried forward three years for MTIT purposes.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

We are exploring a potential sale of our 51 stake in Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC, primarily to reduce our asset size and increase our capital ratios. 

The Bank maintains a 51 ownership interest in Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC Oakmont Capital ), a multi-state equipment finance company based in West Chester, Pennsylvania with a second significant facility located in Albany, Minnesota. We are currently exploring the sale of the Bank s interest in Oakmont Capital in order to reduce our asset size and increase the Bank s capital ratios. In recent periods, Oakmont Capital has materially contributed to our growth in assets and our non-interest income. While we are currently exploring a sale, we may not complete the transaction if we are unable to receive favorable terms for the acquisition of Oakmont Capital. If we complete a sale, we anticipate that our non-interest income will decrease. If we do not complete a sale, we may be required to raise additional capital to support the growth attributable to continued ownership interest in Oakmont Capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor preferences regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, many of which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance.

Annual Report 
 2022 

Quaint Oak Bancorp, Inc. 

PRESIDENT S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS 
 To our Valued Shareholders: 
 
 On behalf of the Board of Directors, Senior Management and Team Members of the Quaint Oak Family of Companies, I am pleased to present our 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
 
 As previously reported in our year-end earnings release: 

Our growth in assets was 43.0 at year end when compared to the prior year-end of December 31, 2021 

Our net income of 7.9 million for the year was an increase 22.8 over the prior year earnings of 2021 

Stockholders equity increased 33.0 , or 12.2 million, over year-end December 31, 2021 

Our asset performance continued to be positive with our non-performing assets as a percent of total assets at 0.25 at December 31, 2022. Additionally, our Texas Ratio calculation ended the year at 3.32 

Looking forward: 
 
 We had previously announced our initiative to provide Banking as a Service (BaaS) to other banks in the form of correspondent banking services. The infrastructure and staffing requirements to launch this initiative are targeted for completion during the third quarter of this year. We anticipate that this endeavor will ultimately provide lower cost funding, generate non-interest income and provide additional core liquidity. 
 
 In support of these endeavors, we have continued to realign reporting channels and expand certain support elements including expanded staffing and external vendor support. We have, working remotely, had the opportunity to add staffing at all levels and now employ team members in 20 states. 
 
 Additionally, we had planned a capital initiative launch in the early part of 2022. I am pleased with the response we received and to report that the plan is currently 83 complete. In addition, to this successful action, we are reviewing certain items that may provide even more liquidity and potential reduction within our own balance sheet going forward. These strategies include a reduction in equipment loans held for sale and a realignment in certain of our subsidiary companies. 
 
 The Company has repurchased an additional 2,147 shares during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. To date we have repurchased over 40 of the original shares issued in our initial public offering. As recently announced, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.13 per share on the common stock of the Company payable on February 6, 2023, to the shareholders of record at the close of business on January 23, 2023. As always, in conjunction with having maintained a strong repurchase plan, our current and continued business strategy includes long-term profitability and payment of dividends reflecting our strong commitment to shareholder value.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 
 Quaint Oak Bancorp, Inc. (the Company was formed in connection with Quaint Oak Bank s (the Bank conversion to a stock savings bank completed on July 3, 2007. The Company s results of operations are dependent primarily on the results of Quaint Oak Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, along with the Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries. The Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered stock savings bank, is headquartered in Southampton, Pennsylvania and conducts business through three regional offices located in the Delaware Valley, Lehigh Valley and Philadelphia markets. At December 31, 2022, the Bank has six wholly-owned subsidiaries, Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC, Quaint Oak Real Estate, LLC, Quaint Oak Abstract, LLC, QOB Properties, LLC, Quaint Oak Insurance Agency, LLC, and Oakmont Commercial, LLC, each a Pennsylvania limited liability company. The mortgage company offers mortgage banking services in the Lehigh Valley, Delaware Valley and Philadelphia County region of Pennsylvania. The real estate and abstract companies offer real estate sales and title abstract services, respectively, primarily in the Lehigh Valley and Bucks County regions of Pennsylvania. These companies began operation in July 2009. In February 2019, Quaint Oak Mortgage opened a mortgage banking office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. QOB Properties, LLC began operations in July 2012 and holds Bank properties acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Quaint Oak Insurance Agency, LLC, located in Chalfont, Pennsylvania, began operations in August 2016 and provides a broad range of personal and commercial insurance coverage solutions. Oakmont Commercial, LLC began operations in October 2021 and operates as a multi-state specialty commercial real estate financing company. Since January, 2021, the Bank holds a majority equity position in Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC, a multi-state equipment finance company based in West Chester, Pennsylvania with a second significant facility located in Albany, Minnesota. 
 
 Quaint Oak Bank s profitability depends, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and the cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by provisions for loan losses, fee income and other non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation, directors fees and expenses, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, professional fees, advertising expense, FDIC deposit insurance assessment, and other expenses. 
 
 Quaint Oak Bank s business consists primarily of originating residential, multi-family and commercial real estate loans secured by property, commercial business loans, and to a lesser extent other consumer loans in its market area. At December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans comprise the largest percentage of Quaint Oak Bank s loan portfolio, before net items, at 52.9 and 25.2 , respectively. At December 31, 2022, commercial business loans include 213,000 of SBA PPP loans. Quaint Oak Bank s loans are primarily funded by certificates of deposit and money market accounts. At December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit amounted to 36.0 of total deposits compared to 40.2 of total deposits at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, money market accounts amounted to 47.5 of total deposits compared to 44.9 of total deposits at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, non-interest bearing checking accounts amounted to 16.2 of total deposits compared to 14.5 of total deposits at December 31, 2021. Management anticipates that certificates of deposit, money market accounts and business checking will be the primary sources of funding for Quaint Oak Bank s assets. 
 
 Our results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly with respect to changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities as well as other factors beyond our control. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements Are Subject to Change 
 
 This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the beliefs, expectations or opinions of the Company and its management regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as: believe , expect , anticipate , intend , plan , estimate , or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional terms such as will , would , should , could , may , likely , probably , or possibly. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are difficult to predict and generally are beyond the control of and its management, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) economic and competitive conditions which could affect the volume of loan originations, deposit flows and real estate values; (2) the levels of non-interest income and expense and the amount of loan losses; (3) competitive pressure among depository institutions increasing significantly; (4) changes in the interest rate environment causing reduced interest margins; (5) general economic conditions, either nationally or in the markets in which the Company is or will be doing business, being less favorable than expected;(6) political and social unrest, including acts of war or terrorism; (7) the impact of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or (8) legislation or changes in regulatory requirements adversely affecting the business in which the Company is or will be engaged. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 In reviewing and understanding financial information for the Company, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans receivable. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. Because all identified losses are immediately charged off, no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Company s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
 
 The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are identified as impaired. For loans that are identified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment. Residential mortgage lending generally entails a lower risk of default than other types of lending. Consumer loans and commercial real estate loans generally involve more risk of collectability because of the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. It is the Company s policy to establish a specific reserve for loss on any delinquent loan when it determines that a loss is probable. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not considered impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral. 
 
 A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring TDR if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions granted under a TDR typically involve a temporary or permanent reduction in payments or interest rate or an extension of a loan s stated maturity date at less than a current market rate of interest. Loans identified as TDRs are designated as impaired. 
 
 For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property. 
 
 The allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrower s overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for all loans (except one-to-four family residential owner-occupied loans) where the total amount outstanding to any borrower or group of borrowers exceeds 750,000, or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. Loans criticized as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified are rated pass. In addition, Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.

 Income Taxes . Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. The realization of our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 
 
 General . The Company s total assets at December 31, 2022 were 792.4 million, an increase of 238.3 million, or 43.0 , from 554.1 million at December 31, 2021. This growth in total assets was primarily due to a 217.9 million, or 53.9 , increase in loans receivable, net, and a 25.4 million, or 23.6 , increase in loans held for sale. The largest increases within the loan portfolio occurred in commercial real estate loans which increased 149.7 million, or 81.4 , commercial business loans which increased 29.5 million, or 22.7 , multi-family residential loans which increased 17.6 million, or 59.9 , construction loans which increased 13.1 million, or 82.7 , and one-to-four family owner occupied loans which increased 8.3 million, or 84.8 , Contributing to the increase in commercial real estate loans was the purchase of a 55.5 million loan portfolio by the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oakmont Commercial, LLC, in April, 2022. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 6.8 million, or 63.6 , from 10.7 million at December 31, 2021 to 3.9 million at December 31, 2022 as excess liquidity was used to fund loans. 
 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale . Investment securities available for sale decreased 1.1 million, or 26.4 , from 4.0 million at December 31, 2021 to 3.0 million at December 31, 2022 due primarily to the principal repayments on these securities during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale increased 25.4 million, or 23.6 , from 107.8 million at December 31, 2021 to 133.2 million at December 31, 2022 as the Bank s mortgage banking subsidiary, Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC, originated 403.2 million in equipment loans held for sale and sold 343.9 million of equipment loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting the increase in loans held for sale is 19.4 million of equipment loan amortization and prepayments. Additionally, the Bank s mortgage banking subsidiary, Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC, originated 118.4 million of one-to-four family residential loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 and sold 132.9 million of loans in the secondary market during this same period. 
 
 Loans Receivable, Net. Loans receivable, net, increased 217.9 million, or 53.9 funded primarily from deposits, excess liquidity and FHLB borrowings. Increases within the portfolio consisted of commercial real estate which increased 149.7 million, or 81.4 , commercial business loans which increased 29.5 million, or 22.7 , construction loans which increased 13.1 million, or 82.7 , multi-family residential loans which increased 17.6 million, or 59.9 , and one-to-four family owner occupied loans which increased 8.3 million, or 84.8 . The increases within the loan portfolio were partially offset by a decrease in other consumer loans which decreased 10,000, or 83.3 . The Company continues its strategy of diversifying its loan portfolio with higher yielding and shorter-term loan products and selling substantially all of its newly originated one-to-four family owner-occupied loans into the secondary market.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. Federal Home Loan Bank stock increased 4.4 million, or 203.1 , from 2.2 million at December 31, 2021 to 6.6 million at December 31, 2022 as the Bank increased its level of FHLB borrowings. 
 
 Bank-Owned Life Insurance. The Company purchased 3.5 million in bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) as a mechanism for funding various employee benefit costs. The Company is the beneficiary of these policies that insure the lives of certain officers of its subsidiaries. The cash surrender value of the insurance policies amounted to 4.2 million and 4.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Premises and Equipment, Net. Premises and equipment, net, increased 122,000, or 4.62 , to 2.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 2.7 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to technology upgrades. 
 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible, Net. Goodwill is related to the recognition of 2.1 million of goodwill as part of the acquisition of Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC in January 2021. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, is also related to the acquisition by Quaint Oak Insurance Agency of the renewal rights to a book of business on August 1, 2016 at a total cost of 1.0 million, a portion of which is being amortized. The balance of other intangible asset at December 31, 2022 was 174,000, net of accumulated amortization of 311,000. 
 
 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased 2.0 million, or 41.9 , to 6.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 4.8 million at December 31, 2021, due primarily to an 856,000 net increase in the right-of-use asset driven by the capitalization of leases for Oakmont in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board accounting standard ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Also contributing to the increase is a 543,000 increase in other assets and a 234,000 increase in the net deferred tax asset. 
 
 Deposits . Total deposits increased 102.1 million, or 22.8 , to 549.3 million at December 31, 2022 from 447.2 million at December 31, 2021. This increase in deposits was primarily attributable to an increase of 60.3 million, or 30.0 , in money market accounts, an increase of 24.0 million, or 37.1 , in non-interest bearing checking accounts, and an increase of 18.0 million, or 10.0 , in certificates of deposit. The increase in total deposits was partially offset by a 241,000, or 13.1 , decrease in savings accounts. The increase in money market accounts was primarily due to a 150.0 million deposit in May, 2022 through a deposit placement agreement with a third party bank. 
 
 Borrowings . Total Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings increased 110.0 million, or 223.7 , to 159.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 49.2 million at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed 197.5 million of FHLB short-term borrowings and 80.0 million of FHLB long-term borrowings and paid down 131.3 million of FHLB short-term borrowings and 36.2 million of FHLB long-term borrowings. Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings increased 3.1 million, or 79.7 , to 7.0 million at December 31, 2022 from 3.9 million at December 31, 2021 as the Company paid off 3.9 million of first round PPP loans pledged as collateral under the FRB s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF) and borrowed 7.0 million from the FRB discount window. The Company did not utilize the FRB s PPPLF to fund second round PPP loans. Other borrowings increased to 5.5 million at December 31, 2022 from none at December 31, 2021.

 Subordinated Debt . On December 27, 2018, the Company issued 8.0 million in subordinated notes. These notes have a maturity date of December 31, 2028, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50 for the first five years of their term and a floating rate for the remaining five years. The Company may, at its option, at any time on an interest payment date on or after December 31, 2023, redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at par plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. The balance of subordinated debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 8.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 7.9 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased 3.6 million, or 59.8 , to 9.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 6.0 million at December 31, 2021, due primarily to a 939,000, or 32.5 , increase in lease liability driven by the capitalization of leases for Oakmont in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board accounting standard ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Also contributing to the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is a 341,000 increase in the net tax liability and a 224,000 increase in accrued bonus expense. In addition, accrued expenses and other liabilities increased as a result of Oakmont s results for the year ended December 31, 2022. The remainder of the increase is attributable to an increase in other expense accruals. 
 
 Stockholders Equity . Total stockholders equity increased 12.2 million, or 33.0 , to 49.1 million at December 31, 2022 from 36.9 million at December 31, 2021. Contributing to the increase was net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 7.9 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2.4 million, issuance of treasury stock for capital raise of 2.4 million, common stock earned by participants in the employee stock ownership plan of 343,000, the reissuance of treasury stock for exercised stock options of 261,000, amortization of stock awards and options under our stock compensation plans of 168,000, and the reissuance of treasury stock under the Bank s 401(k) Plan of 100,000. These increases were partially offset by dividends paid of 1.0 million, noncontrolling interest distribution of 279,000, the purchase of treasury stock of 49,000, and other comprehensive loss, net of 47,000. 
 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 General. Net income amounted to 7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 1.5 million, or 22.8 . The increase in net income on a comparative year-end basis was primarily the result of an increase in non-interest income of 7.4 million, and an increase in net interest income of 3.1 million, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense of 6.2 million, an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2.0 million, an increase in the provision for income taxes of 562,000, and an increase in the provision for loan losses of 274,000. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 3.1 million, or 14.9 , to 23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income was driven by a 7.5 million, or 29.8 , increase in interest income, partially offset by a 4.4 million, or 100.6 , increase in interest expense. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 7.5 million, or 29.8 , to 32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 142.3 million increase in average loans receivable, net, including loans held for sale, which increased from an average balance of 483.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an average balance of 626.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and had the effect of increasing interest income 7.2 million. Also contributing to the increase in interest income was a 108 basis point increase in the yield on average due from banks interest earning, which increased from 0.12 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 1.20 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and had the effect of increasing interest income 258,000. Contributing to the increase in average balance of loans receivable, net was the purchase of a 55.5 million commercial real estate loan portfolio by the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oakmont Commercial, LLC, in April, 2022.

 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 4.4 million, or 100.6 , to 8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a 91 basis point increase in the rate on average money market accounts, which increased from 0.60 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and had the effect of increasing interest expense by 2.4 million. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense was an 85.8 million increase in average money market accounts which increased from an average balance of 174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an average balance of 259.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and had the effect of increasing interest expense by 515,000. The increase in money market average balance was impacted by a 150.0 million deposit in May, 2022 through a deposit placement agreement with a third party bank. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense is a 40.2 million increase in average FHLB long-term borrowings which increased from 25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and had the effect of increasing interest expense by 810,000. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense is a 204 basis point increase in the rate on FHLB short-term borrowings, which increased from 0.30 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.34 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and had the effect of increasing interest expense by 643,000. The average interest rate spread decreased from 3.75 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2022, while the net interest margin decreased from 3.93 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.56 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Provision for Loan Losses. The Company increased its provision for loan losses by 274,000, or 12.4 , from 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, based on an evaluation of the allowance relative to such factors as volume of the loan portfolio, concentrations of credit risk, prevailing economic conditions, prior loan loss experience and amount of non-performing loans at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Non-performing loans at December 31, 2022 amounted to 2.0 million, or 0.32 , of net loans receivable at December 31, 2022, consisting of six loans, three of which are on non-accrual status and three of which are 90 days or more past due and accruing interest. Comparably, non-performing loans amounted to 9,000 at December 31, 2021, consisting of one one-to-four family residential non-owner occupied loan. The non-performing loans at December 31, 2022 consisted of one multi-family residential, and one commercial real estate loan, and four commercial business loans and are generally well-collateralized or adequately reserved for. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans receivable, net was 1.22 at December 31, 2022 and 1.29 at December 31, 2021. There was no other real estate owned (OREO) at December 31, 2022, or December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets amounted to 2.0 million, or 0.25 of total assets at December 31, 2022 compared to 9,000 at December 31, 2021. There was no other real estate owned (OREO) at December 31, 2022, or December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets amounted to 2.0 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 9,000, or 0.19 of total assets at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased 7.4 million, or 62.0 , from 12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a 5.6 million, or 81.7 , increase in net gain on loans held for sale, a 1.7 million, or 1,153.7 , increase in loan servicing income, a 604,000, or 24.2 , increase in mortgage banking, equipment lending, and title abstract fees, a 395,000, or 154.9 , increase in other fees and service charges, a 128,000, or 75.3 , increase in real estate commissions, net, and an 84,000, or 16.5 , increase in insurance commissions. The increase in net gain on loans held for sale was primarily due to the sale of 363.4 million of equipment loans during the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were partially offset by an 837,000, or 73.0 , decrease in gain on sale of SBA loans, and a 362,000, or 100.0 , decrease in gain on sale of investment securities available for sale.

 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 6.2 million, or 29.3 , from 21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Salaries and employee benefits expense accounted for 4.6 million of the change as this expense increased 29.6 , from 15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to expanding and improving the level of staff at the Bank and its subsidiary companies, including Oakmont. The number of full time employees at the Bank and its subsidiary companies, excluding Oakmont increased from 114 at December 31, 2021 to 129 as of December 31, 2022. The number of full-time employees at Oakmont increased from 45 at December 31, 2021 to 63 at December 31, 2022. Other expense accounted for 835,000 of the change as this expense increased 60.3 , from 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. FDIC deposit insurance assessment increased 327,000, from 331,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 658,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Occupancy and equipment expense accounted for 283,000 of the change as this expense increased 17.5 , from 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Advertising expense increased 217,000, or 61.8 , from 351,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 568,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Professional fees accounted for 89,000 of the change as this expense increased 13.5 , from 659,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 748,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to increased audit and compliance costs. Directors fees and expenses accounted for 34,000 of the change as this expense increased 13.5 , from 252,000 for the year ended December 2021 to 286,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting these increases was data processing costs which accounted for a 211,000 decrease, as this expense decreased 23.4 , from 901,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 690,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in data processing costs was directly related to the decrease in loan production at Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC. 
 
 Provision for Income Tax. The provision for income tax increased 562,000, or 22.6 , from 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to an increase in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Operating Segments 
 
 The Company s operations consist of two reportable operating segments: Banking and Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC. Our Banking Segment generates revenues primarily from its lending, deposit gathering and fee business activities. The Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC Segment originates equipment loans which are generally sold to third party institutions with the loans servicing rights retained. The profitability of this segment s operations depends primarily on the gains realized from the sale of loans, processing fees, and service fees. The Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC Segment is also subject to an extensive system of laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of commercial customers. Detailed segment information appears in Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Our Banking Segment reported a pre-tax segment profit PTSP for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 8.4 million, a 93,000, or 1.1 , decrease from the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease in PTSP was due to a 3.1 million, or 19.4 , increase in non-interest expense, a 1.8 million decrease in non-interest income and a 274,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a 4.8 million increase in net interest income. The increase in non-interest expense was due primarily to a 2.6 million, or 23.7 , increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a 327,000, or 98.8 , increase in FDIC deposit insurance assessment, a 157,000, or 30.7 , increase in professional fees, a 65,000, or 5.3 , increase in other expense, a 37,000, or 3.0 , increase in occupancy and equipment, and a 25,000, or 15.5 , increase in advertising expense, partially offset by a 211,000, or 23.4 , decrease in data processing expense. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to an 837,000, or 73.0 , decrease in gain on the sale of SBA loans, a 653,000, or 46.3 , decrease in mortgage banking and title abstract fees, a 362,000, or 100.0 , decrease in gain on sale of investment securities available for sale, a 214,000, or 6.1 , decrease in net gain on loans held for sale, and a 136,000, or 91.3 , decrease in loan servicing income, partially offset by a 131,000, or 65.8 , increase in other fees and service charges, a 128,000, or 75.3 increase in real estate sales commissions, net, and a 73,000, or 100.0 , increase in the loss on sales and write-downs of other real estate owned. 
 
 Our Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC Segment reported a PTSP for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 5.0 million, a 4.1 million, or 486.4 , increase from the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in PTSP was primarily due to a 9.2 million, or 123.8 , increase in non-interest income, partially offset by a 3.1, or 59.0 , increase in non-interest expense. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a 5.8 million, or 171.7 , increase in net gain on loans held for sale, and a 1.3 million, or 115.4 , increase in equipment lending fees. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a 2.0 million, or 44.8 , increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a 770,000, or 484.3 , increase in other expense, a 246,000, or 64.1 , increase in occupancy and equipment expense, and a 192,000 increase in advertising expense.

 Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates 
 
 The Company s ability to maintain net interest income depends upon its ability to earn a higher yield on assets than the rates it pays on deposits and borrowings. The Company s interest-earning assets consist primarily of loans collateralized by real estate which have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of certificates of deposit, money market accounts and to a lesser extent borrowings. Consequently, the Company s ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, certificates of deposit amounted to 198.0 million and 179.9 million, respectively, or 36.0 and 32.5 , respectively, of total assets at such dates. 
 
 Gap Analysis. The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income. Our current interest rate risk management policy provides that our one-year interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets should not exceed positive or negative 20 . This policy was adopted by our management and Board of Directors based upon their judgment that it established an appropriate benchmark for the level of interest-rate risk, expressed in terms of the one-year gap, for the Company. If our one-year gap position approaches or exceeds the 20 policy limit, management will obtain simulation results in order to determine what steps might appropriately be taken, in order to maintain our one-year gap in accordance with the policy. Alternatively, depending on the then-current economic scenario, we could determine to make an exception to our policy or we could determine to revise our policy. Our one-year cumulative gap was a positive 3.7 at December 31, 2022, compared to a positive 2.6 at December 31, 2021. 
 
 The following table sets forth the amounts of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2022, which we expect, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans. The Company s annual historical prepayment rates are applied to loans. Money market and savings accounts are both assumed to have annual rates of withdrawal, or decay rates, of 40 .

 (1) Interest-earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments, 
 scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities. 
 (2) For purposes of the gap analysis, loans receivable includes non-performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses and deferred loan fees. 
 (3) Interest-rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 Qualitative Analysis. Our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes in interest rates. The Company s fixed-rate loans generally are profitable if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed its cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, the Company would have to pay more on its deposits and new borrowings, which would adversely affect its interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, the Company intends to continue to originate more variable rate loans and increase core deposits. The Company also intends to place a greater emphasis on shorter-term home equity loans and commercial business loans. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and to a lesser extent, loan sales and other funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal and interest payments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company sets the interest rates on its deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets that provide additional liquidity. At December 31, 2022, the Company s cash and cash equivalents amounted to 3.9 million. At such date, the Company also had 2.5 million invested in interest-earning time deposits maturing in one year or less.

Quaint Oak Bancorp, Inc. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The Company uses its liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments, to fund deposit outflows, to invest in other interest-earning assets, and to meet operating expenses. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 36.1 million, commitments under unused lines of credit of 52.2 million, and 2.6 million under standby letters of credit. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled 91.3 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. 
 
 In addition to cash flow from loan payments and prepayments and deposits, the Company has significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB), which provide an additional source of funds. As of December 31, 2022, we had 159.2 million of borrowings from the FHLB and had 353.4 million in borrowing capacity. Under terms of the collateral agreement with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, we pledge residential mortgage loans as well as Quaint Oak Bank s FHLB stock as collateral for such advances. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 Quaint Oak Bank had 8.1 million in borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Quaint Oak Bank borrowed 7.0 million from the FRB discount window as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, there was 5.5 million of other short-term borrowings representing balances on two lines of credit that Oakmont Capital Holdings, LLC has with a credit union. Borrowing capacity on the two lines of credit total 15.0 million at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Total stockholders equity increased 12.2 million, or 33.0 , to 49.1 million at December 31, 2022 from 36.9 million at December 31, 2021. Contributing to the increase was net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 7.9 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2.4 million, issuance of treasury stock for capital raise of 2.4 million, common stock earned by participants in the employee stock ownership plan of 343,000, the reissuance of treasury stock for exercised stock options of 261,000, amortization of stock awards and options under our stock compensation plans of 168,000, and the reissuance of treasury stock under the Bank s 401(k) Plan of 100,000. These increases were partially offset by dividends paid of 1.0 million, noncontrolling interest distribution of 279,000, the purchase of treasury stock of 49,000, and other comprehensive loss, net of 47,000.For further discussion of the stock compensation plans, see Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere herein. 
 
 Quaint Oak Bank is required to maintain regulatory capital sufficient to meet tier 1 leverage, common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 4.00 , 4.50 , 6.00 , and 8.00 , respectively. At December 31, 2022, Quaint Oak Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with ratios of 7.07 , 7.41 , 7.41 and 8.49 , respectively. As a small savings and loan holding company, the Company is not currently subject to any regulatory capital requirements. For further discussion of the Bank s regulatory capital requirements, see Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere herein.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. Our exposure to credit loss from non-performance by the other party to the above-mentioned financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. In general, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with off balance sheet credit risk. 
 
 Commitments. At December 31, 2022, we had unfunded commitments under lines of credit of 49.9 million, 36.1 million of commitments to originate loans, and 2.6 million under standby letters of credit. We had no commitments to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding lines of credit or undisbursed construction loans.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the Company s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates.

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 629.5 million as of December 31, 2022, and the associated ALL was 7.7 million. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, trends in volume and terms of loans, credit concentrations, risk rating, collateral values, experience, ability and depth of lending staff and management, national and local economic trends and conditions, COVID-19 pandemic, quality of loan review system, and lending policies. 
 
 We identified these qualitative adjustments within the ALL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. In turn, auditing management s judgments regarding the qualitative factors applied in the ALL calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. 
 
 To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL. 
 
 Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data, third-party macroeconomic data, and considered the existence of new or contrary information. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Company s loan portfolio, and asset quality trends. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors (Continued) 
 
 We also utilized internal credit review specialists with knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of management s risk-rating processes, to ensure that the risk ratings applied to the commercial loan portfolio were reasonable. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2013.

discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment. Residential mortgage lending generally entails a lower risk of default than other types of lending. Consumer loans and commercial real estate loans generally involve more risk of collectability because of the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. It is the Company s policy to establish a specific reserve for loss on any delinquent loan when it determines that a loss is probable. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not considered impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral. A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring TDR if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions granted under a TDR typically involve a temporary or permanent reduction in payments or interest rate or an extension of a loan s stated maturity date at less than a current market rate of interest. Loans identified as TDRs are designated as impaired. For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third -party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property. The allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrower s overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for all loans (except one -to- four family residential owner-occupied loans) where the total amount outstanding to any borrower or group of borrowers exceeds , or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, 
 substandard, doubtful and loss. Loans criticized as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified are rated pass. In addition, Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.

The Company follows guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has more than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company had no material uncertain tax positions or accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company s policy is to account for interest as a component of interest expense and penalties as components of other expense. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for the years before January 1, 2019. 

the underlying policy premium. The Bank estimates the variable consideration based upon the most likely amount method, and does not expect or anticipate a significant reversal of revenue in future periods, based upon historical experience. Payment is due from the insurance carrier for commission income once the insurance policy has been sold. The Bank has elected to apply a practical expedient related to capitalizable costs, which are the commissions paid to insurance producers, and will expense these commissions paid to insurance producers as incurred, as these costs are related to the commission income and would have been amortized within one year or less if they had been capitalized, the same period over which the commission income was earned. Performance-based commissions from insurance companies are recognized at a point in time, when received, and no contingencies remain. 

. These estimates are subject to further refinements based on ongoing evaluations of our model, methodologies, and judgments, as well as prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date. The adoption of ASU 2016 - 13 is not expected to have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filer should adopt the amendments in this Update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019 - 10, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326 ), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815 ), and Leases (Topic 842 , which deferred the effective date for ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019 - 05, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Topic 326 , which allows entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost upon adoption of the new credit losses standard. To be eligible for the transition election, the existing financial asset must otherwise be both within the scope of the new credit losses standard and eligible for the applying the fair value option in ASC 825 - 10.3. The election must be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is not available for either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities. For entities that elect the fair value option, the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the financial asset would be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the date an entity adopted ASU 2016 - 13. Changes in fair value of that financial asset would subsequently be reported in current earnings. For entities that have not yet adopted ASU 2016 - 13, the effective dates and transition requirements are the same as those in ASU 2016 - 13. For entities that have adopted ASU 2016 - 13, ASU 2019 - 05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted once ASU 2016 - 13 has been adopted. In November, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019 - 10, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326 ), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815 ), and Leases (Topic 842 ), which deferred the effective date for ASC 944 , Financial Services Insurance , for public business entities that are SEC filers, except for smaller reporting companies, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years and for all other entities, including smaller reporting companies, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020 - 04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , March 2020, to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance e calls reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to re-measure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met, and can make a one -time election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021 - 01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848 , which provides optional temporary guidance for entities transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates (IBORs) to new references rates so that derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions within Topic 848. ASU 2021 - 01 clarifies that the derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848. ASU 2021 - 01 is effective immediately for all entities. Entities may elect to apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. The amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made, as well as new hedging relationships entered into, after December 31, 2022, and to existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness for periods after December 31, 2022, except for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022 - 02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326 ): Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) and Vintage Disclosures. The guidance amends ASC 326 to eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring activities by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying TDR recognition and measurement guidance, creditors will determine whether a modification results in a new loan or continuation of existing loan. These amendments are intended to enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the amendments to ASC 326 require that an entity disclose current-period gross writeoffs by year of origination within the vintage disclosures, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. The guidance is only for entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2016 - 13 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption using prospective application, including adoption in an interim period where the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year.

The loan portfolio also includes certain loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring, where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forbearance, or other actions. At December 31, 2022, the Company had two loans totaling that were identified as troubled debt restructurings. Both of these loans were performing in accordance with their modified terms as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no new loans were identified as TDRs. At December 31, 2021, the Company had loans totaling that were identified as troubled debt restructurings. One of these loans was performing in accordance with its modified terms and one was on non-accrual as of December 31, 2021. If a TDR is placed on non-accrual it is not reverted back to accruing status until the borrower makes timely payments as contracted for at least six months and future collection under the revised terms is probable. 

Any reserve for an impaired TDR loan is based upon the present value of the future expected cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective rate or upon the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. At December 31, 2022 there were commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loan terms have been modified as TDRs. 
 
 The general practice of the Bank is to work with borrowers so that they are able to pay back their loan in full. If a borrower continues to be delinquent or cannot meet the terms of a TDR modification and the loan is determined to be uncollectible, the loan will be charged off.

In May 2018, the shareholders of Quaint Oak Bancorp approved the adoption of the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan ). The 2018 Stock Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in May 2018 covered a total of shares, of which , or , may be restricted stock awards, for a balance of stock options assuming all the restricted shares are awarded. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 a total of share awards were unvested under the 2013 and 2018 Stock Incentive Plans and up to share awards were available for future grant under the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan and share awards under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2013 and 2018 Stock Incentive Plan share awards have vesting periods of five years. 
 
 A summary of option activity under the Company s Option Plan and 2013 and 2018 Stock Incentive Plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:

 Forfeited -- -- 
 Unvested at the end of the year 

Compensation expense on the restricted stock awards is recognized ratably over the five year vesting period in an amount which is equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant. During both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized approximately of compensation expense. During both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately . As of December 31, 2022, approximately in additional compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining service period of approximately years. 

Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plans Stock Options 
 
 In May 2008, the shareholders of Quaint Oak Bancorp approved the adoption of the 2008 Stock Option Plan (the Option Plan ). The Option Plan authorized the grant of stock options to officers, employees and directors of the Company to acquire shares of common stock with an exercise price no less than the fair market value on the date of the grant. The Option Plan expired February 13, 2018, however, outstanding options granted in 2013 remain valid and existing for the remainder of their 10 year terms. As described above under Stock Incentive Plans Share Awards , the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in May 2013 covered a total of shares, of which may be stock options assuming all the restricted shares are awarded. The 2018 Stock Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in May 2018 covered a total of shares, of which may be stock options assuming all the restricted shares are awarded. 
 
 All incentive stock options issued under the Option Plan and the 2013 and 2018 Stock Incentive Plans are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Options will become vested and exercisable over a five year period and are generally exercisable for a period of ten years after the grant date. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, a total of grants of stock options were outstanding under the Option Plan and 2013 and 2018 Stock Incentive Plans and stock options were available for future grant under the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan, stock options under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and none under the Option Plan. Options will become vested and exercisable over a five year period and are generally exercisable for a period of ten years after the grant date. 
 
 A summary of option activity under the Company s Option Plan and Stock Incentive Plan for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and changes during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: 

Granted -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 Exercised -- -- 
 Forfeited -- -- -- -- 
 Outstanding at the end of the period 
 Exercisable at the end of the period 

The estimated fair value of the options granted in May 2018 was per share. The fair value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 
 
 Expected dividend yield 
 Risk-free interest rate 
 Expected life of options years 
 Expected stock-price volatility 
 
 The dividend yield was calculated on the dividend amount and stock price existing at the grant date. The risk free interest rate used was based on the rates of United States Treasury securities with maturities equal to the expected lives of the options. Although the contractual term of the options granted is ten years, the expected term of the options is less. Management estimated the expected term of the stock options to be the average of the vesting period and the contractual term. The expected stock-price volatility was estimated by considering the Company s own stock volatility. The actual future volatility may differ from our historical volatility. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was million and options exercisable was million. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of the options outstanding was million on and options exercisable was million. The aggregate intrinsic value of a stock option represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option) that would have been received by the option holder had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. This amount changes based on changes in the market value of the Company s common stock. 
 
 During both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately in compensation expense on stock options was recognized. A tax benefit of approximately , was recognized during each of these periods. As of December 31, 2022, approximately in additional compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining service period of approximately years. 

Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 
 Standby letters of credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies, but includes principally residential and commercial real estate. 

for the year ending December 31, 2022 and for the year ending December 31, 2021. 
 
 Certain of the Company s leases contain options to renew the lease after the initial term. Management considers the Company's historical pattern of exercising renewal options on leases and the positive performance of the leased locations, when determining whether it is reasonably certain that the leases will be renewed. If management concludes that there is reasonable certainty about the renewal option, it is included in the calculation of the remaining term of each applicable lease. The discount rate utilized in calculating the present value of the remaining lease payments for each lease was the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advance rate corresponding to the remaining maturity of the lease. The following table presents the weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for the leases outstanding at December 31, 2022.

Under Topic 842, the lessee can elect to not record on the Consolidated Balance Sheets a lease whose term is twelve months or less and does not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no leases that had a term of twelve months or less.

became effective on January 1, 2015. The new capital rules also increased the current minimum of Tier 1 capital ratio from to beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in from January 1, 2016 until January 1, 2019. The new rules also increase the risk weights for several categories of assets, including an 

increase from to for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90 -day past due exposures. The new capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules, but incorporate the new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and the increased Tier 1 RWA requirement into the prompt corrective action framework. 
 
 Bank holding companies are generally subject to statutory capital requirements, which were implemented by certain of the new capital regulations described above that became effective on January 1, 2015. However, the Small Banking Holding Company Policy Statement exempts certain small bank holding companies like the Company from those requirements provided that they meet certain conditions. 
 
 On December 27, 2018, Quaint Oak Bancorp, Inc. issued million in subordinated notes (see Note 12 and infused million to the Bank as Tier 1 capital. As of December 31, 2022 the Bank was adequately capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The Company s ratios do not differ significantly from the Bank s ratios presented below. 
 
 The Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the minimum amounts and ratios required for capital adequacy purposes and to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

57,313 8.00 71,642 10.00

 Tier 1 capital (to average assets) 21,822 

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as the primary regulator for the Company is authorized to extend leverage capital requirements and risk based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies to thrift holding companies. Legislation adopted in late 2014 generally exempts small savings and loan holding companies like Quaint Oak Bancorp from these capital requirements if certain conditions are met. 
 
 Banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. The Company is dependent upon dividends from the Bank to provide funds for the payment of dividends to the Company s shareholders, interest payments on the subordinated debt and other general corporate purposes. The Bank s ability to pay cash dividends directly or indirectly to the Company is governed by federal law, regulations and related guidance. These include the requirement that the Bank must receive approval to declare a dividend if the total amount of all dividends, including the proposed dividend, declared by the Bank in any current year exceeds the total of the Bank s net income for the current year to date, combined with its retained net income for the previous two years. The term retained net income as defined by federal regulations means the Bank s net income for a specified period less the total amount of all dividends declared in that period. 
 
 The Bank may not pay dividends to the Company if, after paying those dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines or if the bank regulators have notified the Bank that it is in need of more than normal supervision. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an insured depository institution such as the Bank is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized (as such term is used in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 
 
 In 2022, the Bank did not pay any cash dividends to the Company. In 2021, the Bank paid a total of million in cash dividends to the Company. At December 31, 2022, the Bank s retained net income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 less the dividends declared and paid during those periods, totaled million. 

Level III: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
 
 This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. 
 
 The methods of determining the fair value of assets and liabilities presented in this note are consistent with our methodologies disclosed in Note 18 of the Company s 2022 Form 10 -K, as the fair value of loans, excluding previously presented impaired loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. The discount rates used to determine fair value use interest rate spreads that reflect factors such as liquidity, credit and non-performance risk. Loans are considered a Level 3 classification. 
 
 The following is a discussion of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis and valuation techniques applied: 
 
 Investment Securities Available For Sale: The fair value of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 ), or matrix pricing (Level 2 ), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. 
 
 We may be required from time to time to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 
 Impaired Loans: Impaired loans are carried at the lower of cost or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans less estimated costs to sell. Collateral is primarily in the form of real estate. The use of independent appraisals, discounted cash flow models and management s best judgment are significant inputs in arriving at the fair value measure of the underlying collateral and impaired loans are therefore classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned: Other real estate owned is carried at the lower of the investment in the real estate or the fair value of the real estate less estimated selling costs. The use of independent appraisals and management s best judgment are significant inputs in arriving at the fair value measure of the underlying collateral and therefore other real estate owned is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The table below sets forth the financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for on a recurring and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022 in thousands): 
 
 -- -- 
 Federal National Mortgage Association mortgage- backed securities -- --

 1 Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various Level 3 inputs which are 
 identifiable. 
 
 2 Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses. The range and weighted 
 average of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percentage of the appraisal. 
 
 The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments that are not required to be measured or reported at fair value were as follows at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 
 -- -- 
 Loans held for sale -- --

For cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable, investment in FHLB stock, bank-owned life insurance, FHLB short-term borrowings, accrued interest payable, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value and are considered Level 1 measurements.
