 General 
 CMS Energy 
 CMS Energy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and NorthStar Clean Energy (formerly known as CMS Enterprises Company), primarily a domestic independent power producer and marketer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical, food, and metal products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. NorthStar Clean Energy, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production. 
 CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides, and operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and NorthStar Clean Energy, its non utility operations and investments. Consumers consolidated operations account for the substantial majority of CMS Energy s total assets, income, and operating revenue.

 Electric Utility Generation and Supply Mix: Consumers Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. 
 In June 2022, Consumers received approval of its 2021 IRP, which updated its Clean Energy Plan. With these updates, Consumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Specifically, the Clean Energy Plan provides for the retirement of the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units in 2023 and the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025.

 2 Represents purchases under long-term PPAs. 
 3 Represents purchases from the MISO energy market. 
 During 2022, Consumers acquired 47 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market. 
 At December 31, 2022, Consumers had future commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants availability or deliverability. The payments for 2023 through 2050 are estimated to total 8.5 billion and, for each of the next five years, range from 0.7 billion to 0.8 billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity Other Material Cash Requirements and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments Contractual Commitments. 
 During 2022, 29 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned six million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 10,217 GWh of electricity. In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 At December 31, 2022, Consumers had future commitments to purchase coal through 2024; payment obligations under these contracts totaled 104 million. Most of Consumers rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had 85 percent of its 2023 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 34-day supply of coal on hand. 
 In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of railcars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers generating facilities. Consumers coal transportation contracts are future commitments and expire on various dates through 2025; payment obligations under these contracts totaled 428 million at December 31, 2022. 
 During 2022, 19 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its natural gas fueled generating units, which burned 49 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 6,684 GWh of electricity. 
 In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For units 3 4 of D.E. Karn, Consumers holds gas transportation contracts to transport to the plant gas that Consumers or an agent purchase from the market. 
 Electric Utility Competition: Consumers electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services. 
 Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers sales, with certain exceptions. At December 31, 2022, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit. Of Consumers 1.9 million electric customers, fewer than 300, or 0.02 percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. For additional information, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Outlook Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. 
 Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers service territory for economic reasons; municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and customer self-generation. Consumers addresses this competition in various ways, including: 
 aggressively controlling operating, maintenance, and fuel costs and passing savings on to customers 
 providing renewable energy options and energy waste reduction programs 
 providing competitive rate-design options, particularly for large energy-intensive customers 
 offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development 
 monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas

The recordable incident rate was 1.17 in 2022 and 1.54 in 2021. The target recordable incident rate for 2023 is 1.07. Over the last ten years, Consumers OSHA recordable incident rate has decreased by 34 percent. 
 Within the utility industry, there is strong competition for rare, high-demand talent, including those related to renewable energy generation, technology, and data analytics. In order to address this competition and to be able to meet their human capital needs, CMS Energy and Consumers provide compensation and benefits that are competitive with industry peers. Furthermore, CMS Energy and Consumers have developed a comprehensive talent strategy, the People Strategy, to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. The strategy focuses on three areas, which are summarized below. 
 Cultivating a Purpose-Driven Culture: This goal is aimed at ensuring all co-workers understand how their work drives CMS Energy s and Consumers key strategic goals. CMS Energy s and Consumers progress toward a purpose-driven culture is measured through an engagement index and an empowerment index developed from data obtained through an annual employee engagement survey of union and non-union co-workers administered by a third party. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the employee engagement index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel satisfied with the company, was 71 percent and ranked in the second quartile of general industry companies. The employee empowerment index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel the workplace promotes empowerment, was 54 percent and ranked in the third quartile of general industry companies. The general industry benchmark was created by the third party who administered the survey through a targeted sampling of working adults within the U.S. who work for firms with widely respected reputations. CMS Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a first-quartile empowerment index score by 2030. 
 Creating a Breakthrough Employee Experience: A breakthrough employee experience is one that instills pride and ownership in one s work. To measure progress toward a breakthrough employee experience, CMS Energy and Consumers measure employees satisfaction with people processes, such as performance management and hiring and onboarding new employees. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the employee experience index was 54 percent; CMS Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a score of 80 percent by 2030. 
 Building Skill Sets at Scale: With an overarching goal of ensuring employees have the right skills to succeed, CMS Energy and Consumers measure progress in this area through achievement of workforce planning and hiring milestones and through a first-time skill attainment index to evaluate the effectiveness of training. CMS Energy and Consumers develop skill sets in co-workers through a variety of means, including union apprenticeship programs and yearly trainings for newly required skills. In 2021, CMS Energy and Consumers launched a full-scale development program for leaders to enable robust succession planning and improve employee engagement and empowerment.

 This talent strategy allows CMS Energy and Consumers to shape employees experience and enable leaders to coach and develop co-workers, source talent, and anticipate and adjust to changing skill sets in the business environment. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 As a part of their People Strategy, CMS Energy and Consumers also employ a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy designed to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of their business. This is done through embedding standards for diversity, equity, and inclusion into all company processes and ensuring these standards are incorporated into all employee experiences. To measure their success, CMS Energy and Consumers utilize select questions in the annual engagement survey to create a diversity, equity, and inclusion index. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the diversity, equity, and inclusion index score was 72 percent. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are committed to building an inclusive workplace that embraces the diverse makeup of the communities that they serve. The following table presents the composition of CMS Energy s and Consumers workforce: 
 December 31, 2022 CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers Percent female employees 27 28 Percent racially or ethnically diverse employees 12 12 Percent employees with disabilities 5 5 Percent veteran employees 11 11 
 Co-workers are also empowered to engage in employee resource groups and events that encourage candid conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion. There are eight employee resource groups available to all co-workers; these groups are, by date of origin: 
 the Women s Advisory Panel, contributing to the achievement of the corporate strategy by supporting the retention, development, and success of women 
 the Minority Advisory Panel, promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion among all racial and ethnic minorities through education, leadership, development, and networking 
 the Women s Engineering Network, connecting and empowering women in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, while building capabilities to support company objectives

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to a variety of factors, often beyond their control, that are difficult to predict and that involve uncertainties that may materially adversely affect CMS Energy s or Consumers business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. 
 Investment/Financial Risks 
 CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations. 
 Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations. 
 Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements. 
 CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations. 
 The level of CMS Energy s present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that: 
 a significant portion of CMS Energy s cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes 
 covenants contained in CMS Energy s existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business 
 CMS Energy s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited 
 CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged 
 CMS Energy s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase 
 CMS Energy s future credit ratings could fluctuate 
 CMS Energy s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which could require CMS Energy to sell assets or obtain additional financing. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs not otherwise funded internally. 
 Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or the inability to obtain required FERC authorization for issuances of securities including debt, could adversely affect CMS Energy s and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash including, but not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing commodity purchasing strategies to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash. 
 Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy s and Consumers securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to explore financing opportunities to supplement their respective financial strategies. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, issuing CMS Energy preferred stock and/or common equity, or entering into commercial paper, bank financing, and leasing arrangements. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities. CMS Energy may also, from time to time, repurchase (either in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire its outstanding debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may or may not be material. 
 Certain of CMS Energy s and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. A reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy s or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase their cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If either or both were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy s credit ratings. 
 Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding. 
 The performance of various markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy s and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energy s and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans.

 Industry/Regulatory Risks 
 Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses. 
 Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers sales, with certain exceptions. The proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is over ten percent. Consumers rates are regulated by the MPSC, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates, putting competitive pressure on Consumers electric supply. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 Distributed energy resources could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses. 
 Michigan law allows customers to use distributed energy resources for their electric energy needs. These distributed energy resources are connected to Consumers electric grid. The state distributed generation program is currently capped by the 2016 Energy Law at one percent of utilities peak loads, but in the settlement of its 2022 electric rate case, Consumers agreed to increase the cap to four percent on its system. Consumers is required to purchase distributed generation customers excess generation at rates determined by the MPSC. Recent FERC policy will also soon allow many customer-owned behind-the-meter and grid-connected distributed energy resources to participate in and receive revenue from wholesale electricity markets. Increased customer use of distributed energy resources could result in a reduction of Consumers electric sales. Third parties operations of distributed energy resources could also potentially have a negative impact on the stability of the grid. An increase in customers use of distributed energy resources, and the rate structure for distributed energy resources customers use of Consumers system and Consumers purchases of their excess generation, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on financial results. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments. Additionally, increasing rates could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, regulatory or legislative actions, and increased competitive or political pressures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non paying customers or could prevent or limit the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism. Regulators could face competitive or political pressures to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including economic downturn in the state or decreased customer base, among others. 
 FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell wholesale electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates paid by Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries are also set by FERC, as are the tariff terms 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 governing the participation of Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries in FERC-regulated wholesale electricity markets operated by regional transmission organizations and independent system operators such as MISO and PJM. At least one CMS Energy subsidiary participates in the wholesale electricity markets operated by ERCOT, over which FERC has limited control. 
 The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes to the tariffs or business practice manuals of certain wholesale market operators such as MISO, PJM, or ERCOT could also have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. If it were determined that CMS Energy or Consumers failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies or wholesale electricity market operators, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energy s or Consumers operations could also have a material adverse effect. 
 FERC, through NERC and its delegated regional entities, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of FERC orders or actions of NERC and its regional entities on electric system reliability. Additionally, national gas pipeline infrastructure has recently been under scrutiny following disruptions related to extreme weather and cyber incidents. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration issued two mandatory security directives related to natural gas pipelines that apply to Consumers. Additional regulation in this area could adversely affect Consumers gas operations. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers have announced ambitious plans to reduce their impact on climate change and increase the reliability of their electric distribution system. Achieving these plans depends on numerous factors, many of which are outside of their control. 
 Consumers has announced a long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy, including a plan to end coal use in 2025 as set forth in the 2021 IRP. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the 2021 IRP and some or all of the 2021 IRP-associated acquisitions of owned or purchased electric generation capacity. Consumers may be unable to acquire, site, and/or permit some or all of the generation capacity proposed in the 2021 IRP. Consumers ability to implement the 2021 IRP may be affected by global supply chain disruptions and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of generation capacity. While CMS Energy and Consumers continue to advocate for advances in technologies required to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases on a cost-effective basis, such advances are largely outside of CMS Energy s and Consumers control. Advancements in technology related to items such as battery storage and electric vehicles may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 IRP. Customer programs such as energy efficiency and demand response may not realize the projected levels of customer participation. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Consumers has also announced its Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a 10-year strategic investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers. This plan includes accelerated infrastructure replacements, innovative leak detection technology, and process changes to reduce or eliminate methane emissions. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the Natural Gas Delivery Plan and some or all of the associated capital investments. Consumers ability to implement its plan may be affected by environmental regulations, global supply chain disruptions, and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of natural gas or the ability to deliver natural gas to customers. Advancements in technology related to items such as renewable natural gas may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in Consumers plan. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if they are unable to achieve their ambitious plans. 
 Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect. Additionally, changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts. 
 CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain subsidiaries of NorthStar Clean Energy qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. In addition, regulatory action on PFAS at the state and/or federal level could cause CMS Energy and Consumers to further test and remediate some sites if PFAS is present at certain levels. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, other types of power plants, and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases. Federal, state, and local environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, undertake heat-rate improvement projects, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Similarly, 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 Consumers could be restricted from constructing natural gas infrastructure due to potential environmental regulations, which could require more costly alternatives. 
 The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy and Consumers: 
 a change in regulators implementation of policy or litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energy s or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage 
 impairment of CMS Energy s or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation 
 extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms or flooding, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or company infrastructure 
 Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, CMS Energy or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures. 
 For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Outlook. 
 CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements. 
 A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission or pollution control equipment could: 
 prevent the construction of new facilities 
 prevent the continued operation of and sale of energy from existing facilities 
 prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities 
 prevent the modification of existing facilities 
 result in significant additional costs 
 CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites. 
 Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites and other response activity costs at a number of other sites, including, but not limited to, sites of retired coal-fueled electric generating units, under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. 
 Business/Operations Risks 
 There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next ten years. 
 Consumers planned investments include the construction or acquisition of electric generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 technology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: 
 effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control 
 effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects 
 availability of qualified construction personnel, both internal and contracted 
 changes in commodity and other prices, applicable tariffs, and/or material and equipment availability 
 governmental approvals and permitting 
 operational performance 
 changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements 
 regulatory cost recovery 
 inflation of labor rates 
 increases in lead times and disruptions in supply chain distribution 
 barriers to accessing key materials for renewable projects (solar, battery, and other key equipment) created by geopolitical relations and U.S. relations with China 
 It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities. 
 The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to: 
 retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions 
 indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make 
 make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions 
 Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories. 
 Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas. 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results. 
 Technology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and recent regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity and managing energy use resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. 
 Customers could also reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs. Similarly, customers could also reduce their consumption of natural gas through alternative technologies or fuels. 
 CMS Energy s and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year. 
 CMS Energy s and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Accordingly, CMS Energy s and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures. 
 In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive confidential security and customer information. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, is increasing in frequency, scope, and potential impact. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised. In addition, because CMS Energy s and Consumers generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. 
 A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations.

 Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events. 
 Natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, civil unrest, vandalism, theft, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could result in severe damage to CMS Energy s and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies (which are subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result. 
 Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to changes in market prices for commodities including, but not limited to, natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. CMS Energy and Consumers manage commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and they may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing CMS Energy s and Consumers risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to CMS Energy or Consumers as a result of future volatility. 
 A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers fuel for electric generation and purchased power are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its positions in these commodities. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. 
 Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts for natural gas to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with the gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its natural gas positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers do not always hedge any or all of the exposure of their operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to execute their risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes in laws that limit CMS Energy s and Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers. 
 Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty s failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather. 
 If Consumers were unable to obtain its supply requirements, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices, implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, or purchase replacement power at higher prices. 
 Unplanned outages or maintenance could be costly for CMS Energy or Consumers. 
 Unforeseen outages or maintenance of the electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities and compression stations, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy or Consumers may be required for many reasons. When unplanned outages occur, CMS Energy and Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but may also have to make spot market purchases of electric and gas commodities that may exceed CMS Energy s or Consumers expected cost of generation or gas supply, be forced to curtail services, or retire a given asset if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Unplanned generator outages could reduce the capacity credit CMS Energy or Consumers receives from MISO and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. 
 General Risk Factors 
 The COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect each of CMS Energy s and Consumers business, results of operations, financial condition, capital investment program, liquidity, and cash flows. 
 The COVID 19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people, businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, in the U.S., and in markets where CMS Energy and Consumers conduct business. These impacts include a reduction in economic activity, disruption to supply chains and operations, increased labor costs, reduced availability of labor, and reduced productivity. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk. 
 Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for

Table of Contents 

 CMS Energy s and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely and adequate fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance, including inadequate performance, of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energy s and Consumers lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect and could result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight. 
 A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers. 
 At December 31, 2022, unions represent 42 percent of Consumers employees. Consumers union agreements expire in 2025. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. 
 Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energy s and Consumers results of operations. 
 In some areas, competition for skilled employees is high and if CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energy s and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses.

 Executive Overview 
 CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and NorthStar Clean Energy (formerly known as CMS Enterprises Company), primarily a domestic independent power producer and marketer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. NorthStar Clean Energy, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production. CMS Energy was also the parent holding company of EnerBank, an industrial bank located in Utah, until October 1, 2021 when EnerBank was acquired by Regions Bank. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and NorthStar

Table of Contents 

 Clean Energy, its non utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses are affected primarily by: 
 regulation and regulatory matters 
 state and federal legislation 
 economic conditions 
 weather 
 energy commodity prices 
 interest rates 
 their securities credit ratings 
 The Triple Bottom Line 
 CMS Energy s and Consumers purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, CMS Energy and Consumers employ the CE Way, a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that CMS Energy and Consumers create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigan s residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of CMS Energy s and Consumers activities. 
 
 CMS Energy s Environmental, Social, Governance and Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes CMS Energy s and Consumers progress toward world class performance measured in the areas of people, planet, and profit. 
 People: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy s and Consumers commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which they do business, and other stakeholders. 
 The safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. Over the last ten years, Consumers OSHA recordable incident rate has decreased by 34 percent. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 CMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measurable improvements in customer satisfaction. 
 Central to Consumers commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable, including: 
 replacement of coal-fueled generation and PPAs with a cost-efficient mix of renewable energy, less-costly dispatchable generation sources, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs 
 targeted infrastructure investment to reduce maintenance costs and improve reliability and safety 
 supply chain optimization 
 economic development to increase sales and reduce overall rates 
 information and control system efficiencies 
 employee and retiree health care cost sharing 
 workforce productivity enhancements 
 While CMS Energy and Consumers have experienced some supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, they have taken steps to mitigate the impact on their ability to provide safe and reliable service to customers. 
 Planet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy s and Consumers commitment to protect the environment. This commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Management considers climate change and other environmental risks in strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to protect the environment and to reduce their carbon footprint. As a result of actions already taken through 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers have: 
 decreased their combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal by 17 percentage points since 2015 
 reduced carbon dioxide emissions by over 30 percent since 2005 
 reduced the amount of water used to generate electricity by over 35 percent since 2012 
 reduced landfill waste disposal by over 1.7 million tons since 1992 
 reduced methane emissions by more than 20 percent since 2012 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 Since 2005, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions by over 90 percent and its nitrogen oxides emissions by over 80 percent. Consumers began tracking mercury emissions in 2007; since that time, it has reduced such emissions by nearly 90 percent. Presented in the following illustration are Consumers reductions in these emissions: 
 
 The 2016 Energy Law: 
 raised the renewable energy standard to 15 percent in 2021; Consumers has met the 15 percent requirement and expects to continue meeting the requirement going forward with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years 
 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025; Consumers achieved 33 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction through 2022 
 authorized incentives for demand response programs and energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs 
 established an integrated planning process for new capacity and energy resources 
 Consumers Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers long-term energy needs. The Clean Energy Plan was originally outlined in Consumers 2018 IRP, which was approved by the MPSC in 2019. Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will meet the requirements of the 2016 Energy Law using its clean and lean strategy, which focuses on increasing the generation of renewable energy, helping customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. 
 In June 2021, Consumers filed its 2021 IRP with the MPSC, proposing updates to the Clean Energy Plan. In April 2022, Consumers and a broad coalition of key stakeholders, including customer groups, environmental organizations, the MPSC Staff, energy industry representatives, and the Michigan Attorney 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 General, filed a settlement agreement with the MPSC resolving Consumers 2021 IRP. The MPSC approved that settlement agreement in June 2022. 
 The 2021 IRP outlines Consumers long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy to its customers, including plans to: 
 end the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025, 15 years sooner than initially planned 
 purchase an existing natural gas-fueled generating unit, providing an additional 1,176 MW of nameplate capacity and allowing Consumers to continue providing controllable sources of electricity to customers 
 solicit approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025 
 expand its investment in renewable energy, adding nearly 8,000 MW of solar generation by 2040 
 Under the 2021 IRP, Consumers will continue to earn a return equal to its weighted-average cost of capital on payments made under new competitively bid PPAs approved by the MPSC. 
 The 2021 IRP will allow Consumers to exceed its breakthrough goal of at least 50 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2030. 
 Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2021 capacity portfolio and its future capacity portfolio under its 2021 IRP. This illustration includes the effects of purchased capacity and energy waste reduction and uses the nameplate capacity for all energy sources:

Table of Contents 

 In addition to Consumers plan to eliminate its use of coal-fueled generation in 2025, CMS Energy and Consumers have set the net zero emissions goals discussed below. 
 Net-zero methane emissions from natural gas delivery system by 2030: Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. 
 Net-zero carbon emissions from electric business by 2040: This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. Consumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. 
 Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for the entire business by 2050: This goal, announced in March 2022, incorporates greenhouse gas emissions from Consumers natural gas delivery system, including suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. Consumers expects to meet this goal through carbon offset measures, renewable natural gas, energy efficiency and demand response programs, and the adoption of cost-effective emerging technologies once proven and commercially available. 
 Additionally, to advance its environmental stewardship in Michigan and to minimize the impact of future regulations, Consumers announced the following targets in 2022: 
 to enhance, restore, or protect 6,500 acres of land by 2026; in 2022, Consumers enhanced, restored, or protected over 700 acres of land 
 to increase the rate of waste diverted from landfills (through waste reduction, recycling, and reuse) to 90 percent from a baseline of 88 percent; in 2022, Consumers rate of waste diverted from landfills was 92 percent 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative, policy, and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate and report greenhouse gases, and related litigation. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could affect them materially, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean and lean strategy. 
 Profit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy s and Consumers commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energy s and Consumers financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to preserve and create jobs, and to reinvest in the communities they serve. 
 In 2022, CMS Energy s net income available to common stockholders was 827 million, and diluted EPS were 2.85. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of 1.3 billion and diluted EPS of 4.66 in 2021. In 2022, higher gas sales due primarily to favorable weather, along with benefits from gas and electric rate increases, were more than offset by the absence of the 2021 gain on the sale of EnerBank. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy s and Consumers performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview. 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 Over the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized electric and gas deliveries to remain relatively stable compared to 2022. This outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset largely by modest growth in electric and gas demand. 
 Performance: Impacting the Triple Bottom Line 
 CMS Energy and Consumers remain committed to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service and positively impacting the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit. During 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers: 
 settled and received approval of Consumers 2021 IRP, gas rate case, and electric rate case, demonstrating the constructive nature of Michigan s regulatory environment 
 partnered with state and federal agencies to secure over 100 million of customer assistance to help keep customer bills affordable 
 committed to power over 1,200 Michigan public buildings with 100 percent clean energy 
 reached an agreement with General Motors Company, a non-affiliated company, to power all of its auto plants within Consumers electric service territory with 100 percent clean energy 
 announced the Clean Air program for residential and business customers who want to offset carbon emissions from their natural gas use and help protect the planet s atmosphere 
 installed five new units at the Freedom Compressor Station, continuing progress toward achieving Consumers Natural Gas Delivery Plan, making its gas system even more safe, reliable, affordable, and clean 
 participated in the state s economic development efforts that resulted in Gotion, Inc., a non affiliated global battery components producer, committing to construct a manufacturing facility in Big Rapids, Michigan 
 received recognition as #1 utility company in the U.S. for America s Best Employers for Women and America s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes 
 CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to utilize the CE Way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. Consumers investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line. 
 Investment Plan: Over the next five years, Consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades, replacements, and clean generation. While it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. Consumers investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of over seven percent. This rate-base growth, together with cost-control measures, should allow Consumers to maintain affordable customer prices. 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 Presented in the following illustration are planned capital expenditures of 15.5 billion that Consumers expects to make from 2023 through 2027: 
 
 Of this amount, Consumers plans to spend 12.4 billion over the next five years to primarily maintain and upgrade its gas infrastructure and electric distribution systems in order to enhance safety and reliability, improve customer satisfaction, reduce energy waste on those systems, and facilitate its clean energy transformation. The gas infrastructure projects comprise 6.3 billion to sustain deliverability, enhance pipeline integrity and safety, and reduce methane emissions. Electric distribution and other projects comprise 6.1 billion to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and interconnect clean energy resources. Consumers also expects to spend 3.1 billion on clean generation, which includes investments in wind, solar, and hydro electric generation resources. 
 Regulation: Regulatory matters are a key aspect of Consumers business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. Important regulatory events and developments not already discussed are summarized below. 
 2021 Gas Rate Case: In December 2021, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of 278 million, based on a 10.5-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2023. In July 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of 170 million, based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity, effective October 1, 2022. The MPSC also approved the continuation of a revenue decoupling mechanism, which annually reconciles Consumers actual weather-normalized non-fuel revenues with the revenues approved. 
 2022 Gas Rate Case: In December 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of 212 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2024. The filing requests authority to recover new infrastructure investment and related costs that are expected to allow Consumers to improve system safety and reliability and reduce fugitive methane emissions. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 2022 Electric Rate Case: In April 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of 272 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. In September 2022, Consumers revised its requested increase to 292 million. The filing requested authority to recover future investments associated with distribution system reliability, solar generation, environmental compliance, and enhanced technology. 
 In January 2023, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of 155 million, based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC also approved a surcharge for the recovery of 6 million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the December 2020 electric rate order. 
 Looking Forward 
 CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. Consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control measures that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. The CE Way is an important means of realizing CMS Energy s and Consumers purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.

 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 CMS Energy and Consumers expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund their present and future commitments. CMS Energy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMS Energy s subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMS Energy depends upon each subsidiary s revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its articles of incorporation and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power

Table of Contents 

 Act and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers dividend restrictions, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4, Financings and Capitalization Dividend Restrictions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Consumers paid 769 million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. 
 Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMS Energy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. Consumers also uses these sources of funding to contribute to its employee benefit plans. 
 Financing and Capital Resources: CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets to fund their robust capital plan. Barring any sustained market dislocations or disruptions, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets and will continue to explore possibilities to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise with respect to future funding needs. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMS Energy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending. 
 In January 2023, Consumers entered into a bond purchase agreement to issue an aggregate principal amount of 400 million of first mortgage bonds through a private placement offering. The bonds, which were priced in November 2022, carry a weighted average interest rate of 5.251 percent and mature at varying dates between 2026 and 2037. The bonds are expected to be issued in May 2023. The proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price of the New Covert Generating Facility and for general corporate purposes. For more information on the purchase of the New Covert Generating Facility, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Clean Energy Plan. 
 Also in January 2023, Consumers issued 425 million of first mortgage bonds that mature in March 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 4.650 percent. The proceeds of the bonds have been used to repay a portion of the 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under Consumers term loan credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. For more information on Consumers recent financing activities, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4, Financings and Capitalization. 
 Under an existing equity offering program, CMS Energy may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 500 million in privately negotiated transactions, in at the market offerings, through forward sales transactions, or otherwise. 
 CMS Energy has entered into forward sales transactions under this program, which allow CMS Energy to either physically settle the contracts by issuing shares of its common stock at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or net settle the contracts through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. CMS Energy may settle the contracts at any time through their maturity dates, and presently intends to physically settle the contracts by delivering shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2022, these contracts have an aggregate sales price of 439 million, maturing through February 2024. For more information on these forward sale contracts, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4, Financings and Capitalization Issuance of Common Stock. 
 At December 31, 2022, CMS Energy had 532 million of its revolving credit facility available and Consumers had 1.3 billion available under its revolving credit facilities. CMS Energy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is Consumers commercial paper program, which allows Consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to 500 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes with 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 maturities of up to 365 days at market interest rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers revolving credit facilities. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity of the facilities. At December 31, 2022, there were 20 million of commercial paper notes outstanding under this program. 
 Certain of CMS Energy s and Consumers credit agreements contain covenants that require CMS Energy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At December 31, 2022, no default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMS Energy s and Consumers credit agreements. CMS Energy and Consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022, as presented in the following table:

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 
 Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties 
 Clean Energy Plan: Consumers Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. Under this net-zero goal, Consumers plans to eliminate the impact of carbon 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 emissions created by the electricity it generates or purchases for customers. Additionally, through its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers continues to make progress on expanding its customer programs, namely its demand response, energy efficiency, and conservation voltage reduction programs, as well as increasing its renewable energy and pumped storage generation. 
 The Clean Energy Plan was originally outlined in Consumers 2018 IRP, which was approved by the MPSC in 2019. In June 2021, Consumers filed its 2021 IRP with the MPSC, proposing updates to the Clean Energy Plan. In April 2022, Consumers and a broad coalition of key stakeholders, including customer groups, environmental organizations, the MPSC Staff, energy industry representatives, and the Michigan Attorney General, filed a settlement agreement with the MPSC resolving Consumers 2021 IRP. The MPSC approved that settlement agreement in June 2022. 
 Under its 2021 IRP, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025 and expects to meet 90 percent of its customers needs with clean energy sources by 2040. Specifically, the 2021 IRP provides for: 
 the retirement of the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units, totaling 515 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2023 
 the retirement of the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, totaling 1,407 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2025 
 the retirement of the D.E. Karn oil and gas-fueled generating units, totaling 1,219 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2031, the units original retirement date 
 The MPSC has authorized Consumers to issue securitization bonds to finance the recovery of and return on the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units. Under the 2021 IRP, Consumers will receive regulatory asset treatment to recover the remaining book value of the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, as well as a 9.0 percent return on equity, commencing in 2025. 
 Under the 2021 IRP, Consumers will bridge the transition away from coal generation with: 
 the purchase of the New Covert Generating Facility, a natural gas-fueled generating unit with 1,176 MW of nameplate capacity in Van Buren County, Michigan, for 815 million, subject to certain adjustments, in 2023; the purchase was approved by FERC in November 2022 
 a one-time competitive solicitation to acquire approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025; of this amount, 500 MW would be from dispatchable sources 
 These actions are expected to allow Consumers to continue providing controllable sources of electricity to customers while expanding its investment in renewable energy. The 2021 IRP forecasts renewable energy capacity levels of 30 percent in 2025, 43 percent in 2030, and 61 percent in 2040, including the addition of nearly 8,000 MW of solar generation. Additionally, the 2021 IRP will accelerate Consumers deployment of battery storage from 2030 to 2024, with 75 MW of energy storage by 2027 and an additional 475 MW by 2040. 
 Under its 2021 IRP, Consumers will continue to bid new capacity competitively and will own and operate approximately 50 percent of new capacity, with the remainder being built and owned by third parties. Additionally, Consumers will continue to earn a return equal to its weighted-average cost of capital on payments made under new competitively bid PPAs approved by the MPSC.

 As a result of requests for proposals, Consumers has entered into PPAs to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from solar generating facilities and build transfer agreements to purchase solar generating facilities. Presented in the following illustration is the aggregate renewable capacity that Consumers expects to add to its portfolio as a result of these agreements: 
 
 In support of its 2021 IRP, Consumers issued a request for proposals in September 2022 to acquire approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025. Specifically, Consumers solicited offers to acquire 500 MW of capacity from dispatchable sources and 200 MW of capacity from intermittent resources and dispatchable, non-intermittent clean capacity resources (including battery storage resources). 
 In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it is opening inquiries into whether manufacturers of solar modules that are produced in certain countries using supplies obtained from China are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duties which apply to Chinese modules. The U.S. Department of Commerce has made an initial determination that four manufacturers have circumvented tariffs. The remainder of this inquiry process is expected to continue through at least the first half of 2023. In June 2022, the Biden Administration paused for two years the imposition of duties that might result from the U.S. Department of Commerce s pending inquiries. In addition, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was enacted in December 2021 and became effective in June 2022, along with an earlier withhold release order that U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued in mid-2021, restrict the importation of goods sourced from the Xinjiang region of China. Solar modules whose raw materials come from the Xinjiang region are a key focus of these import laws. Consumers continues to closely monitor these matters and their potential impacts on availability of solar modules and timing associated with pending and planned solar projects. 
 Renewable Energy Plan: The 2016 Energy Law raised the renewable energy standard to 15 percent in 2021. Consumers is required to submit RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least 15 percent of Consumers electric sales volume each year. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers has met the 15 percent 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 requirement and expects to continue meeting the requirement going forward with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years. 
 Under Consumers renewable energy plan, the MPSC has approved the acquisition of up to 525 MW of new wind generation projects and authorized Consumers to earn a 10.7 percent return on equity on any projects approved by the MPSC. Specifically, the MPSC has approved the following: 
 purchase and construction of a 150 MW wind generation project in Gratiot County, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership in 2020 
 purchase of a 166 MW wind generation project in Hillsdale, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership in February 2021 
 purchase of a wind generation project under development, with capacity of up to 201 MW, in Gratiot County, Michigan; Consumers expects to take full ownership and begin commercial operation of the project in 2023 
 The MPSC also approved the execution of a 20-year PPA under which Consumers will purchase 100 MW of renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 149 MW solar generating facility to be constructed in Calhoun County, Michigan; the facility is targeted to be operational in 2024. 
 Voluntary Large Customer Renewable Energy Program: Consumers provides service under a program that provides large full-service electric customers with the opportunity to advance the development of renewable energy beyond the requirements of the 2016 Energy Law. In September 2021, the MPSC approved Consumers request to amend its renewable energy plan to remove the annual subscription limit associated with this program. The MPSC also approved up to 1,000 MW of new wind and solar generation projects between 2024 and 2027 to meet customer demand for the program. Consumers will competitively solicit for additional renewable energy assets based on customer applications and will construct the assets based on customer subscriptions to the program. 
 Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers electric customer deliveries are seasonal and largely dependent on Michigan s economy. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Each year in June, electric residential customers transition to a summer peak time-of-use rate that allows them to take advantage of lower-cost energy during off-peak times during the summer months. Thus, customers can reduce their electric bills by shifting their consumption from on peak to off peak times. 
 Over the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized electric deliveries to remain relatively stable compared to 2022. This outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset largely by modest growth in electric demand. Actual delivery levels will depend on: 
 energy conservation measures and results of energy waste reduction programs 
 weather fluctuations 
 Michigan s economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, electric vehicle adoption, and housing activity 
 Electric ROA: Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers sales, with certain exceptions. At December 31, 2022, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit. Of Consumers 1.9 million electric customers, fewer than 300, or 0.02 percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. 
 72 

Table of Contents 

 The 2016 Energy Law established a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. The law also authorized the MPSC to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the four-year forward period. In 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers. Under this mechanism, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four-year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier. 
 During 2017, the MPSC issued orders finding that it has statutory authority to determine and implement a local clearing requirement, which requires all electric suppliers to demonstrate that a portion of the capacity procured to serve customers during peak demand times is located in the MISO footprint in Michigan s Lower Peninsula. In 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the MPSC s statutory authority to implement a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. 
 In 2020, ABATE and another intervenor filed a complaint against the MPSC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutionality of a local clearing requirement. The complaint requests the federal court to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the MPSC from implementing a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. Consumers filed a motion to intervene and defend the local clearing requirement in that federal litigation; this motion was granted in January 2021 and the complaint is pending decision by the court after a non-jury trial. 
 Electric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 MPSC Reliability Report and Audit: In October 2022, the MPSC ordered the state s two largest electric utilities, including Consumers, to report on their compliance with regulations and past MPSC orders governing the utilities response to outages and downed lines. Also, the MPSC Staff was directed to engage a third-party auditor to review all equipment and operations of the two utilities distribution systems. 
 Consumers has responded to the MPSC s order and awaits further action by the MPSC. Consumers is committed to working with other state utilities, the third-party auditor, and the MPSC to continue improving electric reliability and safety in Michigan. 
 
 2022 Electric Rate Case: In April 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of 272 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. In September 2022, Consumers revised its requested increase to 292 million. The filing requested authority to recover future investments associated with distribution system reliability, solar generation, environmental compliance, and enhanced technology. 
 In January 2023, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of 155 million, based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC also approved a surcharge for the recovery of 6 million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the December 2020 electric rate order. Additionally, the approved settlement provides for a pension and OPEB tracker that will allow Consumers to defer the future recovery or refund of pension and OPEB expenses above or below the amounts used to set existing rates, respectively. For additional details on the 
 73 

Table of Contents 

 settlement agreement, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Regulatory Matters. 
 PSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2023 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September 2022. As a result of higher-than-normal power supply costs during 2022, Consumers included a projection of its full-year 2022 underrecovery in its 2023 PSCR plan. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers self-implemented the 2023 PSCR charge beginning in January 2023. 
 In January 2023, Consumers filed a motion for a temporary order in its 2023 PSCR plan, requesting that the MPSC approve only a third of the 2022 underrecovery amount for recovery in 2023, with the remaining amount to be recovered equally during 2024 and 2025. Recovering the 2022 underrecovery over three years will provide immediate relief to electric customers, and the financial impact will be neutral to Consumers earnings. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Regulatory Matters. 
 
 Retention Incentive Program: Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will retire the D.E. Karn coal-fueled electric generating units in 2023. In 2019, Consumers announced a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the D.E. Karn generating complex through the anticipated retirement of the coal-fueled generating units. Based on the number of employees that have chosen to participate, the aggregate cost of the program through 2023 is estimated to be 35 million. In its order in Consumers 2020 electric rate case, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for these costs. Consumers expects to recognize 2 million of retention benefit costs in 2023; this expense will be deferred as a regulatory asset. 
 Under the 2021 IRP, Consumers will retire the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. Similar to the D.E. Karn program, Consumers is providing a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the J.H. Campbell generating complex through retirement. Based on the number of employees that have chosen to participate, the aggregate cost of the program through 2025 is estimated to be 50 million. Consumers expects to recognize 16 million of retention benefit costs in 2023. The 2021 IRP provides deferred accounting treatment for retention costs recognized during 2022; deferral of costs beyond 2022 was approved as part of the 2022 electric rate case settlement. For additional details on these programs, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations. 
 
 Electric Environmental Outlook: Consumers electric operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of 210 million from 2023 through 2027 to continue to comply with RCRA, the Clean Air Act, and numerous other environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. 
 Air Quality: Multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers electric utility. 
 In 2012, the EPA published emission standards for electric generating units, known as MATS, based on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Consumers has complied, and continues to comply, with the MATS regulation, and does not expect MATS to materially impact its environmental strategy. 
 CSAPR requires Michigan and many other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA modeling, contribute to ground-level ozone in other downwind states. Since its 2015 effective date, CSAPR has been revised several times. One such revision made in 2021 
 74 

Table of Contents 

 provided updated emission reductions through 2024 from electric generating units in 12 states, including Michigan. Consumers believes the impact of this rule on its generation operations should be minimal. 
 In March 2022, the EPA proposed another revision to CSAPR that affects Michigan. If finalized as proposed, this revision would reduce nitrogen oxides allowance budgets beginning in 2023 and would change the mechanism for allocating such allowances on a year-over-year basis. While prior CSAPR regulations have primarily focused on electric generating units, this latest proposal also includes other sources of nitrogen oxides emissions. If the EPA finalizes the proposed CSAPR revision in its current form, Consumers may incur significant costs in allowance purchases and/or equipment retrofits. Consumers will continue to monitor this rulemaking and its impact on Consumers electric operations. 
 In 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify power plants and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. In 2018, the EPA designated certain areas of Michigan as not meeting the ozone standard. None of Consumers fossil-fuel-fired generating units are located in these areas. Additionally, in January 2023, the EPA proposed lowering the NAAQS for particulate matter. Consumers will continue to monitor NAAQS rulemakings and evaluate potential impacts to its generating assets. 
 Consumers strategy to comply with air quality statutes and regulations involved the installation and operation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rules in conjunction with other EPA and EGLE rulemakings, litigation, executive orders, treaties, and congressional actions. This evaluation could result in: 
 a change in Consumers fuel mix 
 changes in the types of generating units Consumers may purchase or build in the future 
 changes in how certain units are operated 
 the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers generating units 
 changes in Consumers environmental compliance costs 
 the purchase or sale of allowances 
 Greenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation and reporting of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives, as appropriate. 
 In June 2022, the EPA announced its plan to propose a new rule to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. Under its 2021 IRP, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proposed rule will materially impact Consumers over the remaining operating lives of these coal-fueled facilities. However, Consumers cannot predict the form and extent of such potential regulation on its natural gas-fueled generation until this rule is released. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Under its 2021 IRP, Consumers plans to reduce carbon emissions from its electric business by 60 percent from 2005 levels in 2025. At this time, Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these events, as its plans exceed the nationally committed reduction. The commitment made by the U.S. is not binding without new Congressional legislation. 
 In 2020, Michigan s Governor signed an executive order creating the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which outlines goals for Michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be 
 75 

Table of Contents 

 carbon neutral by 2050. The executive order aims for a 28 percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. These goals are aspirational in nature and any changes in law or regulation to achieve these goals would need to be approved by the Michigan Legislature or the relevant regulatory agency. Additionally, Consumers has already surpassed the 28 percent reduction milestone for its owned electric generation and previously announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these events. 
 Increased frequency or intensity of severe or extreme weather events, including those due to climate change, could materially impact Consumers facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. Consumers is unable to predict these events or their financial impact; however, Consumers evaluates the potential physical impacts of climate change on its operations, including increased frequency or intensity of storm activity; increased precipitation; increased temperature; and changes in lake and river levels. Consumers released a report addressing the physical risks of climate change on its infrastructure in February 2022. Consumers is taking steps to mitigate these risks as appropriate. 
 While Consumers cannot predict the outcome of changes in U.S. policy or of other legislative, executive, or regulatory initiatives involving the potential regulation or reporting of greenhouse gases, it intends to move forward with its Clean Energy Plan, its present net-zero goals, and its emphasis on reliable and resilient supply. Litigation, international treaties, executive orders, federal laws and regulations (including regulations by the EPA), and state laws and regulations, if enacted or ratified, could ultimately impact Consumers. Consumers may be required to: 
 replace equipment 
 install additional emission control equipment 
 purchase emission allowances or credits (including potential greenhouse gas offset credits) 
 curtail operations 
 arrange for alternative sources of supply 
 purchase facilities that generate fewer emissions 
 mothball or retire facilities that generate certain emissions 
 pursue energy efficiency or demand response measures more swiftly 
 take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases 
 Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations. 
 CCRs: In 2015, the EPA published a rule regulating CCRs under RCRA. This rule adopts minimum standards for beneficially using and disposing of non hazardous CCRs and establishes technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments. The rule also sets out conditions under which some CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR wastewater and initiate closure. Due to litigation, many aspects of the rule have been remanded to the EPA, resulting in more proposed and final rules. Anticipated litigation related to remanded aspects will add uncertainty around requirements for compliance and state permit programs. 
 In 2020, the EPA amended the conditions of forced closure and required all unlined surface impoundments to initiate closure by mid-2021, unless conditions that satisfied an alternate closure schedule were approved by the EPA. Consumers, with agreement from EGLE, completed the work necessary to initiate closure by excavating CCRs or placing a final cover over each of its relevant CCR units prior to the closure initiation deadline. 
 76

 Separately, Congress passed legislation in 2016 allowing participating states to develop permitting programs for CCRs under RCRA Subtitle D. In 2018, the Michigan Legislature adopted standards for a permitting program, which requires the EPA s authorization. In 2020, EGLE submitted a regulatory package for Michigan s permit program to the EPA for its review, which is still pending. Federal rulemaking challenges may delay EPA approval of the Michigan permitting program. 
 Consumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs related to coal ash disposal sites. 
 Water: Multiple water-related regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers. 
 The EPA regulates cooling water intake systems of existing electric generating plants under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The rules seek to reduce alleged harmful impacts on aquatic organisms, such as fish. In 2018, Consumers submitted to EGLE for approval all required studies and recommended plans to comply with Section 316(b), but has not yet received final approval. 
 The EPA also regulates the discharge of wastewater through its effluent limitation guidelines for steam electric generating plants. In 2020, the EPA revised previous guidelines related to the discharge of certain wastewater, but allowed for extension of the compliance deadline from the end of 2023 to the end of 2025, upon approval by EGLE through the NPDES permitting process. Consumers received such an extension to 2025 for its J.H. Campbell generating facility, which it plans to retire in 2025. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these revisions or any litigation of the guidelines. 
 In recent years, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have proposed changes to the scope of federal jurisdiction over bodies of water and to the frequency of dual jurisdiction in states with authority to regulate the same waters; Michigan is one such state. Additionally, a final 2022 rulemaking changed the definition of Waters of the United States. Consumers does not expect adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the current interpretations. 
 Many of Consumers facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are vital to the facilities operations. Consumers applies for renewal of these permits every five years. Failure of EGLE to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of NPDES permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility. 
 Protected Wildlife: Multiple regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers relating to protected species and habitats. 
 Statutes like the federal Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act may impact operations at Consumers facilities. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced its intent to regulate incidental take under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Any resulting permitting and monitoring fees and/or restrictions on operations could impact Consumers existing and future operations, including wind and solar generation facilities. 
 Additionally, Consumers is monitoring proposed changes to the listing status of several species within its operational area due to an increase in wildlife-related regulatory activity at federal and state levels. A change in species listed under the Endangered Species Act may impact Consumers costs to mitigate its impact on protected species and habitats at certain existing facilities as well as siting choices for new facilities.

 Other Matters: Other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on Consumers outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies Electric Environmental Matters. 
 
 Consumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties 
 Gas Deliveries: Consumers gas customer deliveries are seasonal. The peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. 
 Over the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized gas deliveries to remain stable relative to 2022. This outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset largely by modest growth in gas demand. Actual delivery levels will depend on: 
 weather fluctuations 
 use by power producers 
 availability and development of renewable energy sources 
 gas price changes 
 Michigan s economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity 
 the price or demand of competing energy sources or fuels 
 energy efficiency and conservation impacts 
 Gas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers gas utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 
 2022 Gas Rate Case: In December 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of 212 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2024. The filing requests authority to recover new infrastructure investment and related costs that are expected to allow Consumers to improve system safety and reliability and reduce fugitive methane emissions. Presented in the following table are the components of the requested increase in revenue: 
 Projected Twelve-Month Period Ending September 30 2024 Components of the requested rate increase Investment in rate base 80 Operating and maintenance costs 47 Cost of capital 63 Sales and other revenue 22 Total 212 
 The filing also seeks approval of a pension and OPEB tracker that will allow Consumers to defer for future recovery or refund pension and OPEB expense above the amounts used to set existing rates and an uncollectible deferral/refund mechanism. 
 Postretirement Benefits Expense Accounting Application: In January 2023, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC, requesting authority to defer the future recovery or refund of pension and OPEB expenses above or below the amounts used to set existing rates, respectively. Consumers requested this accounting treatment to begin in 2023 and to continue until rates are reset in the 2022 gas rate case. 
 78

 Depreciation Rate Case: In December 2021, Consumers filed a depreciation case related to its gas utility plant property. In this case, Consumers requested a decrease in depreciation expense of 1 million annually based on December 31, 2020 balances. In September 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing a decrease in depreciation expense of 29 million annually. The decrease in depreciation expense will become effective concurrent with Consumers 2022 gas rate case. 
 GCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2023-2024 GCR plan to the MPSC in December 2022 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2023-2024 GCR charge beginning in April 2023. 
 
 Gas Pipeline and Storage Integrity and Safety: The U.S. Department of Transportation s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has published various rules that expand federal safety standards for gas transmission pipelines and underground storage facilities. Initial requirements took effect in 2020, with future regulation phases to be released over numerous years. To comply with these rules, Consumers will incur increased capital and operating and maintenance costs to install and remediate pipelines and to expand inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of its existing pipelines and storage facilities. 
 Although associated capital or operating and maintenance costs relating to these regulations could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover such costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations. 
 Gas Environmental Outlook: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23 former MGP sites. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies Gas Environmental Matters. 
 Consumers gas operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. 
 Air Quality: Multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers gas utility. 
 In 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify natural gas compressor stations and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. In 2018, the EPA designated certain areas of Michigan as not meeting the ozone standard. Seven counties in southeastern Michigan were not in attainment with the ozone standard by a 2021 regulatory deadline, and thus may have their ozone nonattainment designations increased from marginal to moderate. The EPA also recently elevated the nonattainment status of three counties in western Michigan from marginal to moderate. Some of Consumers compressor stations are located in these areas. Consumers expects to incur costs to retrofit equipment to lower emissions at some of its compressor stations located in the nonattainment areas. 
 In March 2022, the EPA proposed a revision to CSAPR that affects Michigan. This proposed rule seeks to reduce interstate air pollution transport issues that EPA modeling suggests contribute to downwind states attaining or maintaining compliance with the NAAQS for ozone. While prior CSAPR regulations have primarily focused on electric generating units, the proposed rule includes other emission sources, including engines at natural gas compressor stations. If the EPA finalizes the proposed CSAPR revision in its current form, Consumers may incur costs to retrofit or replace equipment at some compressor stations. 
 Greenhouse Gases: There is increasing interest at the federal, state, and local levels in potential regulation of greenhouse gases or their sources. Such regulation, if adopted, may involve requirements to reduce 
 79

 methane emissions from Consumers gas utility operations and carbon dioxide emissions from customer use of natural gas. No such measures apply to Consumers at this time. 
 In 2020, Michigan s Governor signed an executive order creating the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which outlines goals for Michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be carbon neutral by 2050. The executive order aims for a 28 percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. For additional details on the executive order, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Electric Environmental Outlook. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The commitment made by the U.S. is not binding without new Congressional legislation. Consumers continues to monitor these initiatives and comment as appropriate. Consumers cannot predict the impact of any potential future legislation or regulation on its gas utility. 
 Consumers is making voluntary efforts to reduce its gas utility s methane emissions. Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. To date, Consumers has reduced methane emissions by more than 20 percent from a 2012 baseline. 
 In March 2022, Consumers also announced a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for its entire natural gas system by 2050. This includes suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. Consumers Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a 10-year strategic investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers, outlines ways in which Consumers can make early progress toward these goals in a cost-effective manner, including energy waste reduction or energy efficiency, carbon offsets, and renewable natural gas supply. 
 Consumers has already initiated work in these key areas, continuing to expand its energy waste reduction targets, launching a program allowing gas customers to purchase carbon offset credits on a voluntary basis, and announcing plans to begin development of a renewable natural gas facility that will capture methane from manure generated at a Michigan-based farm and convert it into renewable natural gas. Consumers is evaluating and monitoring newer technologies to determine their role in achieving Consumers interim and long-term net-zero goals, including hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic methane; carbon capture sequestration systems; and other innovative technologies. 
 Over the long term, Consumers will incorporate technological advances, policy-driven incentives, and other influencing factors into its compliance, investment planning, and decarbonization strategy in order to achieve these net-zero methane and greenhouse gas emissions goals. 
 
 NorthStar Clean Energy Outlook and Uncertainties 
 CMS Energy s primary focus with respect to its NorthStar Clean Energy businesses is to maximize the value of generating assets, its share of which represents 1,478 MW of capacity, and to pursue opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects. 
 NorthStar Clean Energy s operations may be subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. NorthStar Clean Energy s primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters.

 In 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify power plants and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. In 2018, the EPA designated certain areas of Michigan as not meeting the ozone standard. Seven counties in southeastern Michigan were not in attainment with the ozone standard by a 2021 regulatory deadline, and thus may have their ozone nonattainment designations increased from marginal to moderate. The DIG plant is within one of these counties and, as a result, may be subject to additional permitting restrictions in the event of any future increase in the nonattainment designation. 
 In March 2022, the EPA proposed a revision to CSAPR that affects Michigan. This proposed rule seeks to reduce interstate air pollution transport issues that EPA modeling suggests contribute to downwind states attaining or maintaining compliance with the NAAQS for ozone. If the EPA finalizes the proposed CSAPR revision in its current form, NorthStar Clean Energy may incur significant costs in allowance purchases and equipment retrofits. NorthStar Clean Energy will continue to monitor this rulemaking and its impact on its emission sources. 
 Many of NorthStar Clean Energy s facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are vital to the facilities operations. NorthStar Clean Energy applies for renewal of these permits every five years. Failure of EGLE to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of NPDES permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility. 
 For additional details regarding the new ozone NAAQS or CSAPR rule, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Electric Environmental Outlook. 
 Trends, uncertainties, and other matters related to NorthStar Clean Energy that could have a material impact on CMS Energy s consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include: 
 investment in and financial benefits received from renewable energy and energy storage projects 
 changes in energy and capacity prices 
 severe weather events and climate change associated with increasing levels of greenhouse gases 
 changes in commodity prices on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings 
 changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation 
 indemnity obligations assumed in connection with ownership interests in facilities that involve tax equity financing 
 representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMS Energy in connection with sales of assets 
 delays or difficulties in obtaining environmental permits for facilities located in areas associated with environmental justice concerns

 In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it is opening inquiries into whether manufacturers of solar modules that are produced in certain countries using supplies obtained from China are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duties which apply to Chinese modules. The U.S. Department of Commerce has made an initial determination that four manufacturers have circumvented tariffs. The remainder of this inquiry process is expected to continue through at least the first half of 2023. In June 2022, the Biden Administration paused for two years the imposition of duties that might result from the U.S. Department of Commerce s pending inquiries. In addition, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was enacted in December 2021 and became effective in June 2022, along with an earlier withhold release order that U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued in mid-2021, restrict the importation of goods sourced from the Xinjiang region of China. Solar modules whose raw materials come from the Xinjiang region are a key focus of these import laws. CMS Energy continues to closely monitor these matters and their potential impacts on availability of solar modules and timing associated with pending and planned solar projects. 
 For additional details regarding NorthStar Clean Energy s uncertainties, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments Guarantees. 
 
 Other Outlook and Uncertainties 
 
 Litigation: CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 
 Employee Separation Program: In April 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers announced a voluntary separation program for salaried non-union employees. For the year ended December 31, 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers recorded an after-tax charge of 8 million related to the program, under which more than 170 employees accepted and were approved for early separation. As a result of the program, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to benefit from future cost savings, as employee staffing levels will be better matched to workload demand, which reflects the companies ongoing workforce productivity improvements. 
 
 Tax Legislation: CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. Among other things, this Act expands production tax credits and investment tax credits, allows for the transferability of such credits, and implements a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax on companies with an average adjusted financial statement income of more than 1.0 billion. While CMS Energy and Consumers are still assessing the overall impacts of the bill, they have determined they will not be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023, and do not believe the corporate alternative minimum tax will have a material impact on their business.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The following information is important to understand CMS Energy s and Consumers results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. 
 In the preparation of CMS Energy s and Consumers consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMS Energy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, contingencies, and AROs. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMS Energy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments. 
 Accounting for the Effects of Industry Regulation: Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings. 
 Contingencies: CMS Energy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMS Energy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMS Energy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 Derivative Instruments: CMS Energy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. At CMS Energy, if the derivative is accounted for as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in AOCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions impact earnings. If the derivative is accounted for as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For the FTRs at Consumers, changes in fair value are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. 
 The criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require judgment in application. Changes in business strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 which could have a material impact on CMS Energy s and Consumers financial statements. For additional details on CMS Energy s and Consumers derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5, Fair Value Measurements. 
 Income Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMS Energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMS Energy s judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMS Energy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMS Energy s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12, Income Taxes. 
 
 Pension and OPEB: CMS Energy and Consumers provide retirement pension benefits to certain employees under non contributory DB Pension Plans, and they provide postretirement health and life benefits to qualifying retired employees under an OPEB Plan. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including: 
 life expectancies 
 discount rates 
 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 
 rate of compensation increases 
 expected health care costs 
 A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMS Energy s and Consumers recorded liabilities and associated expenses. 
 84

 Presented in the following table are estimates of credits and cash contributions through 2025 for the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Pl an. Actual future costs, credits, and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the participants of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan. CMS Energy and Consumers will, at a minimum, contribute to the plans as needed to comply with federal funding requirements. In Millions DB Pension Plans OPEB Plan Credit Contribution Credit Contribution CMS Energy, including Consumers 2023 (58) (76) 2024 (64) (71) 2025 (63) (75) Consumers 1

 1 Consumers pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process. 
 
 Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of the DB Pension Plans by 25 basis points would increase estimated pension cost for 2023 by 8 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers. Lowering the PBO discount rates by 25 basis points would decrease estimated pension cost for 2023 by 1 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 Pension and OPEB plan assets are accounted for and disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require judgment. 
 For additional details on postretirement benefits, including the fair value measurements for the assets of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10, Retirement Benefits. 
 
 Unbilled Revenues: Consumers customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or natural gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Consumers records unbilled revenues as accounts receivable and accrued revenue on its consolidated balance sheet. For additional information on unbilled revenues, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14, Revenue. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 There are no new accounting standards issued but not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact on CMS Energy s or Consumers consolidated financial statements.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to mitigate exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMS Energy and Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of certain officers and a risk committee consisting of those and other officers and business managers. 
 The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of ten percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed ten percent. 
 Long-Term Debt: CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate debt instruments. CMS Energy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital. 
 Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of interest-rate risk on CMS Energy s and Consumers debt instruments (assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of ten percent):

 Regulatory Assets 
 Energy Waste Reduction Plan Incentive: The energy waste reduction incentive mechanism provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC. 
 In October 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to collect million during 2023 as an incentive for exceeding its statutory savings targets in 2021. Consumers recognized incentive revenue under this program of million in 2021. 
 Consumers also exceeded its statutory savings targets in 2022, achieved certain other goals, and will request the MPSC s approval to collect million, the maximum performance incentive, in the energy waste reduction reconciliation to be filed in May 2023. Consumers recognized incentive revenue under this program of million in 2022. 
 Costs of Coal-fueled Electric Generating Units to be Retired: In 2019, the MPSC approved the settlement agreement reached in Consumers 2018 IRP, under which Consumers will retire the D.E. Karn coal-fueled electric generating units in 2023. Under Michigan law, electric utilities have been permitted to use highly rated, low-cost securitization bonds to finance the recovery of qualified costs. In 2019, Consumers removed from total plant, property, and equipment an amount representing the projected remaining book value of the coal-fueled electric generating units upon their retirement, and recorded it as a regulatory asset. In 2020, the MPSC issued a securitization financing order authorizing Consumers to issue securitization bonds in order to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of the coal-fueled electric generating units upon their retirement. Until securitization, the book value of the generating units will remain in rate base and receive full regulatory returns in general rate cases. 
 In June 2022, the MPSC approved the settlement agreement reached in Consumers 2021 IRP, under which Consumers plans to retire the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. Under the 2021 IRP, upon the units retirement, Consumers will receive regulatory asset treatment to recover their remaining book value, as well as a percent return on equity, over their original design lives. Until retirement, the book value of the generating units will remain in rate base and receive full regulatory returns in general rate cases. 
 In June 2022, Consumers removed from total plant, property, and equipment an amount of billion, representing the projected remaining book value of the electric generating units upon their retirement, and recorded it as a non-current regulatory asset on its consolidated balance sheets. 
 Postretirement Benefits: As part of the ratemaking process, the MPSC allows Consumers to recover the costs of postretirement benefits. Accordingly, Consumers defers the net impact of actuarial losses and gains, prior service costs and credits, and settlements associated with postretirement benefits as a regulatory asset or liability. The asset or liability will decrease as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. For details about settlements and the amortization periods, see Note 10, Retirement Benefits.

 smaller coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in 2016 and smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in 2015. Upon receipt of the MPSC s order, Consumers removed the book value of the units from plant, property, and equipment and recorded this amount as a regulatory asset. Consumers is amortizing the regulatory asset over the life of the related securitization bonds, which it issued through a subsidiary in 2014. For additional details regarding the securitization bonds, see Note 4, Financings and Capitalization. 
 MGP Sites: Consumers is incurring environmental remediation and other response activity costs at former MGP facilities. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover from its natural gas customers over a period the costs incurred to remediate the MGP sites. 
 Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt: Under regulatory accounting, any unamortized discount, premium, or expense related to debt redeemed with the proceeds of new debt is capitalized and amortized over the life of the new debt. 
 Retention Incentive Program: To ensure necessary staffing at the D.E. Karn and J.H. Campbell generating complexes through the anticipated retirement of the coal-fueled generating units, Consumers has established retention incentive programs. In 2020, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for the retention and severance costs incurred under the D.E. Karn program, and Consumers began deferring these costs as a regulatory asset in 2021. In addition, under the 2021 IRP, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for the retention and severance costs incurred under the J.H. Campbell program during 2022; deferral of costs beyond 2022 was approved as part of the 2022 electric rate case settlement. For additional details regarding the retention incentive program, see Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations. 
 Demand Response Program: In Consumers 2018 IRP and general rate cases, the MPSC has approved the recovery of demand response costs. Consumers annually files a reconciliation with the MPSC to review actual demand response costs against amounts approved. The amount of spending incurred in excess of amounts included in rates for recovery is recorded as a regulatory asset and amortized when it is collected from customers. The amount included in rates for recovery in excess of spending incurred is recorded as a regulatory liability to be refunded to customers. 
 Energy Waste Reduction Plan: The MPSC allows Consumers to collect surcharges from customers to fund its energy waste reduction plan. The amount of spending incurred in excess of surcharges collected is recorded as a regulatory asset and amortized as surcharges are collected from customers over the plan period. The amount of surcharges collected in excess of spending incurred is recorded as a regulatory liability and amortized as costs are incurred. 
 Regulatory Liabilities 
 Income Taxes, Net: Consumers records regulatory assets and liabilities to reflect the difference between deferred income taxes recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts previously reflected in Consumers rates. This net balance will decrease over the remaining life of the related temporary differences and flow through income tax expense. The majority of the net regulatory liability recorded 
 111

 million voluntarily to utility customers. In January 2023, Consumers submitted a filing proposing that the refund take the form of incremental funding to cover the cost of, and return on, certain distribution capital investments above amounts included in rates and contributions to programs that assist vulnerable customers. 
 Additionally, in the settlement of its 2022 electric rate case, Consumers agreed to refund voluntarily million of 2022 revenues to utility customers through a one-time bill credit and to fund million in contributions to programs that directly assist vulnerable customers with utility bills. 
 Cost of Removal: The MPSC allows Consumers to collect amounts from customers to fund future asset removal activities. This regulatory liability is reduced as costs are incurred to remove the assets at the end of their useful lives. 
 Renewable Energy Grant: In 2013, Consumers received a million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds Energy Park, which began operations in 2012. This grant reduces Consumers cost of complying with Michigan s renewable portfolio standard and, accordingly, reduces the overall renewable energy surcharge to be collected from customers. The regulatory liability recorded for the grant will be amortized over the life of Lake Winds Energy Park. 
 Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers has collected surcharges to fund its renewable energy plan. Amounts not yet spent under the plan are recorded as a regulatory liability, which is amortized as incremental costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers renewable generation facilities and to purchase RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements. Incremental costs represent costs incurred in excess of amounts recovered through the PSCR process. 
 Consumers Electric Utility 
 2021 Electric Rate Case: In December 2021, the MPSC issued a final order in Consumers 2021 electric rate case, disallowing cost recovery for fleet assets and certain other categories of recently completed capital expenditures incurred by Consumers. As a result, Consumers impaired certain of these capital expenditures, a portion of which were held by the gas utility, and recorded impairment charges totaling million within maintenance and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 2022 Electric Rate Case: In April 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of million, based on a -percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. In September 2022, Consumers revised its requested increase to million. The filing requested authority to recover future investments associated with distribution system reliability, solar generation, environmental compliance, and enhanced technology. 
 112 

Table of Contents 

 million, based on a -percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC also approved a surcharge for the recovery of million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the December 2020 electric rate order. Additionally, the approved settlement provides for the following: 
 a pension and OPEB tracker that will allow Consumers to defer the future recovery or refund of pension and OPEB expenses above or below the amounts used to set existing rates, respectively 
 a refund of million of 2022 revenues to utility customers through a one-time bill credit 
 a commitment to fund million in contributions to programs that directly assist vulnerable customers with utility bills 
 deferred accounting treatment for depreciation and property tax expense as well as the debt component of the overall rate of return for distribution-related capital investments exceeding a certain threshold amount 
 an increase to the distributed generation cap from percent to percent on Consumers system 
 There were no direct disallowances of historical capital expenditures within the approved settlement agreement. The new rates became effective January 20, 2023. 
 Voluntary Radio Tower Asset Sale Gain Share: In May 2022, Consumers completed a sale of various radio tower assets. In June 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval to share voluntarily half of the gain from the sale with its electric and gas utility customers; this application was approved by the MPSC in October 2022. During 2022, Consumers shared two-thirds with electric customers through additional spending for tree trimming and one-third with gas customers through a donation to nonprofit agencies that provide customer energy bill assistance. 
 Consumers Gas Utility 
 2021 Gas Rate Case: In December 2021, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of million, based on a -percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2023. In April 2022, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to million, based on a -percent authorized return on equity. In July 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of million, based on a -percent authorized return on equity, effective October 1, 2022. The MPSC also approved the continuation of a revenue decoupling mechanism, which annually reconciles Consumers actual weather-normalized non-fuel revenues with the revenues approved. 
 Power Supply Cost Recovery and Gas Cost Recovery 
 The PSCR and GCR ratemaking processes are designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply and purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR and GCR billing charges monthly, subject to ceiling factor limitations, in order to minimize the underrecovery or overrecovery amount in the annual reconciliations. Underrecoveries represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers; overrecoveries represent previously collected revenues that will be refunded to customers.

 GCR underrecoveries Accounts receivable and accrued revenue Liabilities PSCR overrecoveries Accrued rate refunds 
 Due to spikes in fuel prices during 2022, the cost of electric generation increased, resulting in higher market prices for electricity. Accordingly, Consumers power supply costs for 2022 were significantly higher than those projected in its 2022 PSCR plan. Consumers included a projection of its full-year 2022 underrecovery in the 2023 PSCR plan filed with the MPSC in September 2022. In January 2023, Consumers filed a motion for a temporary order in its 2023 PSCR plan, requesting that the MPSC approve only a third of the 2022 underrecovery amount for recovery in 2023, with the remaining amount to be recovered equally during 2024 and 2025. Recovering the 2022 underrecovery over will provide immediate relief to electric customers, and the financial impact will be neutral to Consumers earnings. 
 PSCR Plans and Reconciliations: In August 2022, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2020 PSCR reconciliation, authorizing recovery of billion of power costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2021 PSCR reconciliation the underrecovery of million. In its order, the MPSC disallowed the recovery of million of replacement power costs associated with an extended outage at Ludington. Consumers filed an appeal of the MPSC s order with the Michigan Court of Appeals in September 2022. 
 In March 2022, Consumers filed its 2021 PSCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of billion of power costs and authorization to reflect in its 2022 PSCR reconciliation the overrecovery of million. 
 Consumers submitted its 2022 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September 2021 and self-implemented its proposed 2022 PSCR charge in January 2022. 
 GCR Plans and Reconciliations: In April 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Consumers 2020-2021 GCR reconciliation, authorizing recovery of billion of gas costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2021-2022 GCR reconciliation the overrecovery of million. 
 In June 2022, Consumers filed its 2021-2022 GCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of billion of gas costs and authorization to reflect in its 2022-2023 GCR reconciliation the underrecovery of million.

 million for its remaining obligations for environmental remediation. CMS Energy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of percent and an inflation rate of percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is million. 
 
 CMS Energy s estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are changes in circumstances or assumptions used in calculating the liability. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMS Energy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter. 
 Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies 
 Electric Environmental Matters: Consumers operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations. 
 Cleanup and Solid Waste: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates its liability for NREPA sites for which it can estimate a range of loss to be between million and million. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had

 million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. 
 Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under CERCLA. CERCLA liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River CERCLA site. The notification claimed that the EPA had reason to believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In 2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties asked to participate in the removal action plan, including Consumers, declined to accept liability. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river. 
 Based on its experience, Consumers estimates its share of the total liability for known CERCLA sites to be between million and million. Various factors, including the number and creditworthiness of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers share of the total liability. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a recorded liability of million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable CERCLA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. 
 The timing of payments related to Consumers remediation and other response activities at its CERCLA and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. A change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and CERCLA liability. 
 Ludington PCB: In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed part of the PCB material and replaced it with non PCB material. Consumers has had several communications with the EPA regarding this matter, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome. 
 Ludington Plant Overhaul Contract Dispute: Consumers and DTE Electric, co-owners of Ludington, are parties to a 2010 engineering, procurement, and construction contract with TAES, under which TAES is charged with performing a major overhaul and upgrade of Ludington. TAES performance has been unsatisfactory and resulted in overhaul project delays. Consumers and DTE Electric have demanded that TAES provide a comprehensive plan to resolve quality control concerns, including adherence to its warranty commitments and other contractual obligations. Consumers and DTE Electric have taken extensive efforts to resolve these issues with TAES, including a formal demand to TAES parent, Toshiba Corporation, a non-affiliated company, under a parent guaranty it provided in the contract. TAES has not provided a comprehensive plan or otherwise met its performance obligations. 
 In order to enforce the contract, Consumers and DTE Electric filed a complaint against TAES and Toshiba Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in April 2022. In June 2022, TAES and Toshiba Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, along with an answer and counterclaims seeking approximately million in damages related to payments allegedly owed under the parties contract. As a co-owner of Ludington, Consumers would be liable for percent of any such damages. In September 2022, the court denied the motion to dismiss filed by TAES and Toshiba Corporation. Consumers believes the counterclaims are without merit, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

 million in damages allegedly caused by Consumers decision to retire the unit before the end of its useful life. In July 2022, Consumers filed a motion for summary disposition, which was heard in August 2022. In October 2022, the state circuit court judge found that Consumers may, in its sole discretion, retire the J.H. Campbell 3 coal-fueled generating unit, provided that Consumers continues to operate and make necessary improvements to the unit while the litigation concerning Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc. s claim for damages is pending. Consumers believes Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc. s claim has no merit, but cannot predict the final impact or outcome on this matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies 
 Gas Environmental Matters: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. These sites include former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site. 
 At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a of million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of percent and an inflation rate of percent. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is million. 
 
 Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability. 
 Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a period. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a regulatory asset of million related to the MGP sites.

 million. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a recorded liability of less than million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. 
 Ray Compressor Station: On January 30, 2019, Consumers experienced a fire at the Ray Compressor Station, which resulted in the Ray Storage Field being off line or operating at significantly reduced capacity, which negatively affected Consumers natural gas supply and delivery capacity. This incident, which occurred during the extreme polar vortex weather condition, required Consumers to request voluntary reductions in customer load, to implement contingency gas supply purchases, and to implement a curtailment of natural gas deliveries for industrial and large commercial customers pursuant to Consumers MPSC curtailment tariff. The curtailment and request for voluntary reductions of customer loads were canceled as of midnight, February 1, 2019. Consumers investigated the cause of the incident, and filed a report on the incident with the MPSC in April 2019. In response, the MPSC issued an order in July 2019, directing Consumers to file additional reports regarding the incident and to include detail of the resulting costs in a future rate proceeding. The compressor station is presently operating at full capacity. 
 In September 2020, the MPSC disallowed the recovery of million in incremental gas purchases related to the fire. In February 2021, after the MPSC denied Consumers petition for rehearing challenging this disallowance, Consumers filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2022, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision rejecting Consumers appeal. Consumers plans to file an application for leave to appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court in February 2023. 
 In December 2021, Consumers filed a gas rate case with the MPSC that included a request for recovery of the capital expenditures incurred to restore and modify the compressor station. Consumers incurred capital expenditures of million during 2020 and 2021 to restore and modify the compressor station. 
 During 2022, Consumers received insurance proceeds of million, representing recovery of costs incurred to restore the compressor station and incremental gas purchases related to the fire. Consumers had recognized the insurance recovery during 2021. 
 In June 2022, Consumers, the MPSC Staff, and other intervenors reached a settlement of the gas rate case and the MPSC approved it in July 2022. As a part of the settlement agreement, Consumers agreed, at this time, to not seek recovery of the capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds, related to restoring and modifying the Ray Compressor Station. As a result, Consumers recorded an impairment charge of million within maintenance and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income in 2022.

 1 These obligations arose from the sale of membership interests in NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind to tax equity investors. NorthStar Clean Energy provided certain indemnity obligations that protect the tax equity investors against losses incurred as a result of breaches of representations and warranties under the associated limited liability company agreements. These obligations are generally capped at an amount equal to the tax equity investor s capital contributions plus a specified return, less any distributions and tax benefits it receives, in connection with its membership interest. For any indemnity obligations related to Aviator Wind, NorthStar Clean Energy would recover percent of any amounts paid to the tax equity investor from the other owner of Aviator Wind Equity Holdings. Additionally, Aviator Wind holds insurance coverage that would partially protect against losses incurred as a result of certain failures to qualify for production tax credits. For further details on NorthStar Clean Energy s ownership interest in NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind, see Note 18, Variable Interest Entities. 
 2 These obligations arose from stock and asset sale agreements under which CMS Energy or a subsidiary of CMS Energy indemnified the purchaser for losses resulting from various matters, including claims related to taxes and breaches of representations and warranties. The maximum obligation amount is mostly related to an Equatorial Guinea tax claim and an indemnity provided in connection with the sale of EnerBank to Regions Bank. For further details on the sale, see Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations . 
 3 This obligation comprises a guarantee provided by Consumers to the U.S. Department of Energy in connection with a settlement agreement regarding damages resulting from the department s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants formerly owned by Consumers. 
 Additionally, in the normal course of business, CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMS Energy have entered into various agreements containing tax and other indemnity provisions for which they are unable to estimate the maximum potential obligation. CMS Energy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities and those disclosed in the table to be remote. 
 Other Contingencies 
 In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and Note 2, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, as well as unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business to which CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMS Energy are parties. These other lawsuits, proceedings, and unasserted claims may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters.

 Short-term Borrowings: Under Consumers commercial paper program, Consumers may issue, in one or more placements, investment-grade commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days at market interest rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers revolving credit facilities and may have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of up to million. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity of the facilities.

 Dividend Restrictions: At December 31, 2022, payment of dividends by CMS Energy on its common stock was limited to billion under provisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act of 1972. 
 Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at December 31, 2022, Consumers had billion of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that, under a variety of circumstances, dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, Consumers paid million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy.

 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities: The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of mutual funds, which are valued using the daily quoted net asset values. CMS Energy and Consumers value their nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect the amount owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections.

 Derivative Instruments: CMS Energy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMS Energy s and Consumers derivatives are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. 
 The derivatives classified as Level 2 were interest rate swaps at CMS Energy, which were valued using market-based inputs. CMS Energy used interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on certain long term debt obligations. 
 A subsidiary of NorthStar Clean Energy used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with future interest payments on certain long term variable-rate debt. The interest rate swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges of the future variability of interest payments on the debt. In June 2022, NorthStar Clean Energy repaid the hedged debt and terminated the related interest rate swaps. As a result, the associated unrecognized losses recorded in other comprehensive income were recognized in interest on long-term debt on CMS Energy s consolidated statements of income; this amount was immaterial. NorthStar Clean Energy also had other interest rate swaps that economically hedged interest rate risk on debt, but that did not qualify for cash flow hedge

 CMS Energy s target 2022 asset allocation for the assets of the DB Pension Plans was percent equity, percent fixed income, and percent real assets. 
 CMS Energy established union and non union VEBA trusts to fund future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non utility subsidiaries. CMS Energy s target 2022 asset allocation for the health trusts was percent equity, percent fixed income, and percent real assets. CMS Energy s target asset allocation for the life trusts was percent equity, percent fixed income, and percent multi-asset investments. 
 The goal of these target allocations was to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plans. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S P 500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers, as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Real asset investments are diversified across real estate investment trusts, public infrastructure, and public resource equity. Multi-asset investments are global tactical asset allocations. CMS Energy uses annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocations.

 month service requirement and a performance condition. The performance condition is based on an adjusted measure of CMS Energy s EPS growth relative to a peer group over a period. The awards granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020 require a month service period. Market-based restricted stock vesting is generally contingent on meeting a service requirement and a market condition. The market condition is based on a comparison of CMS Energy s total shareholder return with the median total shareholder return of a peer group over the same period. Depending on the outcome of the performance condition or the market condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from to percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock generally vests after a service period of . 
 Restricted Stock Units: In 2022, 2021, and 2020, CMS Energy and Consumers granted restricted stock units to certain non employee directors who elected to defer their restricted stock awards. The restricted stock units generally vest after a service period of or, if earlier, at the next annual meeting. The restricted stock units will be distributed to the recipients as shares in accordance with the directors deferral agreements. Restricted stock units do not have voting rights, but do have dividend rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, the dividends on restricted stock units are paid in additional units equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted stock units are subject to the same vesting and distribution conditions as the underlying restricted stock units. restricted stock units were forfeited during 2022.

 CMS Energy and Consumers charge the fair value of the restricted stock awards to expense over the required service period and charge the fair value of the restricted stock units to expense immediately. For performance-based awards, CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the number of shares expected to vest at the end of the performance period based on the probable achievement of the performance objective. Performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards have graded vesting features for retirement-eligible employees, and CMS Energy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards for non retirement-eligible employees and time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period. 
 The fair value of performance-based and time-lapse restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the price of CMS Energy s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based restricted stock awards is calculated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMS Energy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMS Energy common stock. The risk-free rate for valuation of the market-based restricted stock awards was based on the three year U.S. Treasury yield at the award grant date.

 million. NWO Holdco owns 100 percent of Northwest Ohio Wind, LLC, a MW wind generation project in Paulding County, Ohio. NorthStar Clean Energy retained a Class B membership interest in NWO Holdco. 
 NorthStar Clean Energy has a percent ownership interest in Aviator Wind Equity Holdings, which holds a Class B membership interest in Aviator Wind, the holding company of a MW wind generation project in Coke County, Texas. The Class A membership interest in Aviator Wind is held by a tax equity investor. 
 Earnings, tax attributes, and cash flows generated by NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind are allocated among and distributed to the membership classes in accordance with the ratios specified in the associated limited liability company agreements; these ratios change over time and are not representative of the ownership interest percentages of each membership class. Since NWO Holdco s and Aviator Wind s income and cash flows are not distributed among their investors based on ownership interest percentages, NorthStar Clean Energy allocates the entities income (loss) among the investors by applying the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CMS Energy Corporation 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CMS Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Accounting for the Effects of New Regulatory Matters 
 As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a utility and must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, the Company records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by a non - regulated business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recognized a total of million of regulatory assets, million of regulatory liabilities, and million of accrued revenue. As described by management, there are multiple participants to rate case proceedings who often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of the Company s policies and practices. These participants often seek cost disallowances and other relief and have appealed significant decisions reached by the regulators. The recovery of regulatory assets and the settlement of regulatory liabilities are contingent upon the outcomes of rate cases and regulatory proceedings. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to management s accounting for the effects of new regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity applied to evaluate management s assessment of the potential outcomes and related accounting impacts associated with pending rate case proceedings, (ii) in some cases, the significant audit effort necessary to assess contrary evidence from various parties involved in rate case proceedings, and (iii) the significant audit effort necessary to evaluate audit evidence related to the recovery of regulatory assets and the settlement of regulatory liabilities.

 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment of regulatory proceedings, including the probability of recovering incurred costs and the related accounting and disclosure impacts. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the Company s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding whether recovery of regulatory assets and settlement of regulatory liabilities is probable and evaluating the sufficiency of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Procedures were performed to evaluate the regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate cases, based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, or application of relevant regulatory precedents.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 CMS Energy 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy s CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: CMS Energy s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). CMS Energy s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of CMS Energy 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMS Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of CMS Energy 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of CMS Energy s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 
 Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

The CMS Energy Chief Executive Officer also reserves the right in his or her discretion to not pay Annual Awards or to reduce the amount of Annual Awards for a Performance Year. All decisions of the CMS Energy Chief Executive Officer are final. 

V. PAYMEN T OF ANNUAL AWARDS 
 
 5.1 Cash Annual Award . All Annual Awards for a Performance Year will be paid in cash no later than March 15 th of the calendar year following the Performance Year provided that the Annual Award for a particular Performance Year has not been deferred voluntarily pursuant to Section 4.2. The amounts required by law to be withheld for income and employment taxes will be deducted from the Annual Award payments. All Annual Awards become the obligation of the company on whose payroll the employee or NorthStar Clean Energy Officer is enrolled at the time CMS NorthStar Clean Energy makes the Annual Award. 
 
 5.2 Deferred Annual Awards. 
 
 (a) The payment of all or any portion (rounded to an even multiple of 10 of a cash Annual Award may be deferred voluntarily at the election of individual participants in salary grades 19-25. Any such deferral will be net of any applicable FICA or FUTA taxes. A separate irrevocable election must be made prior to the Performance Year. Any Annual Award made by CMS NorthStar Clean Energy after termination of employment of a participant or retirement of a participant will be paid in accordance with any deferral election made within the enrollment period. 
 5 

(b) At the time the participant makes a deferral election he or she must select the payment options (including the Payment Event as set forth at (c) below and the Payment Term as set forth at (d) below) applicable to the Deferred Annual Award for the Performance Year, as well as any earnings or income attributable to such amounts. The payment options elected will apply only to that year s Deferred Annual Award and will not apply to any previous Deferred Annual Award or to any subsequent Deferred Annual Award. Any participant who elects to defer all or a portion of an Annual Award and who fails to select a Payment Event or a Payment Term will be presumed to have elected a Payment Event of Separation from Service in accordance with paragraph (c)(i) below and or a Payment Term of a single sum. 
 
 (c) The Payment Event elected can be either 
 
 (i) Separation from Service for any reason other than death. Payment will be made, or begin, in the later of (1) January of the year following the year of the Separation from Service or (2) the seventh month after the month of the Separation from Service. Later installments, if any, will be paid in January of the succeeding years. Effective for amounts deferred in 2019 and succeeding years, payment will be made, or begin, in the seventh month after the month of Separation from Service. Later installments, if any, will be paid in the same month of the succeeding years 
 
 (ii) Payment upon attainment of a date certain that is more than 1 year after the last day of the applicable Performance Year. Later installments, if any, will be paid in the same month of the succeeding years or 
 
 (iii) The later to occur of (i) or (ii) above. 

(d) Payment Term. At the time of electing to defer an Annual Award, the participant must also elect how he or she wishes to receive any such payment from among the following options (the participant may elect a separate Payment Term for each Payment Event elected) 
 
 (i) Payment in a single sum upon occurrence of the Payment Event. 
 
 (ii) Payment of a series of annual installment payments over a period from two (2) years to fifteen (15) years following the Payment Event. Each installment payment shall be equal to a fractional amount of the balance in the account the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of installment payments remaining. Although initially such installment payments will be identical, actual payments may vary based upon investment performance. For example, a series of 5 installment payments will result in a payout of 1 5 of the account balance in the first installment, of the account balance (including investment gains or losses since the first installment date) in the second installment, etc. 
 
 (e) Changes to Payment Options. Once a payment option has been elected, subsequent changes which would accelerate the receipt of benefits from the Plan are not permitted, except that the Plan Administrator, which is the Benefit Administration Committee as defined in the Savings Plan for Employees of Consumers Energy and other CMS Energy Companies (the Savings Plan ), 
 6 

may at its discretion accelerate payments to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A and applicable regulations. A subsequent election to change the payment options related to a Payment Event, in order to delay a payment or to change the form of a payment, can only be made when all of the following conditions are satisfied 
 
 (i) such election may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made 
 
 (ii) the payment(s) with respect to which such election is made is deferred for a period of not less than 5 years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made (or, in the case of installment payments under Section 4.2(d)(ii) with regard to amounts deferred (and the related earnings) prior to January 1, 2016, 5 years from the date the first installment was scheduled to be paid) and 
 
 (iii) such election must be made not less than 12 months before the date the payment was previously scheduled to be made (or, in the case of installment payments under Section 4.2(d)(ii) with regard to amounts deferred (and the related earnings) prior to January 1, 2016, 12 months before the first installment was scheduled to be paid), if the participant s previous commencement date was a specified date. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2016, the right to a series of installment payments is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments to the extent permissible under Code Section 409A and any applicable regulations. When making a subsequent election with respect to the payment of any post-December 31, 2015 deferral, the participant may make a separate election with respect to each separate payment, provided that such election must result in all of the applicable Performance Year s deferral with related earnings being paid in a single sum or in a series of annual payments over a period from two (2) to fifteen (15) consecutive years. 
 
 (f) Investments. At the time of electing to voluntarily defer payment, the participant must elect how the Deferred Annual Award will be treated by CMS NorthStar Clean Energy. To the extent that any amounts deferred are placed in a rabbi trust with an independent Record Keeper, a participant who has previously deferred amounts under this Plan will automatically have his or her existing investment profile apply to this deferral also. All determinations of the available investment options by the Plan Administrator are final and binding upon participants. A participant may change the investment elections at any time prior to the payment of the benefit, subject to any restrictions imposed by the Plan Administrator, the plan Record Keeper or by any applicable laws and regulations. A participant not making an election will have amounts deferred treated as if in a Lifestyle Fund as defined in the Savings Plan applicable to the participant's age 65, rounded up, or such other investment as determined by the Plan Administrator. All gains and losses will be based upon the performance of the investments selected by the participant from the date the deferral is first credited to the nominal account. If the Company elects to fund its obligation as discussed below, then investment performance will be based on the balance as determined by the Record Keeper. 
 
 (g) The amount of any Deferred Annual Award is to be satisfied from the general corporate funds of the company on whose payroll the Plan participant was 
 7 

enrolled prior to the payout beginning and are subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company. This is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan. To the extent the Company elects to place funds with a trustee to pay its future obligations under this Plan, such amounts are placed for the convenience of CMS NorthStar Clean Energy, remain the property of CMS NorthStar Clean Energy and the participant shall have no right to such funds until properly paid in accordance with the provisions of this Plan. For administrative ease and convenience, such amounts may be referred to as participant accounts, but as such are a notional account only and are not the property of the participant. Such amounts remain subject to the claims of the creditors of CMS NorthStar Clean Energy. 
 
 (h) Payment in the Event of an Unforeseeable Emergency. The participant may request that payments commence immediately upon the occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency as that term is defined in Code Section 409A and any applicable regulations. Generally, an unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident of the participant or the participant s spouse or dependent, loss of the participant s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant. A distribution on account of unforeseeable emergency may not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the participant s assets (without causing severe financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under this arrangement, the Savings Plan or other arrangements. Distributions because of an unforeseeable emergency shall not exceed the amount permitted under Section 409A and accordingly are limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (after use of insurance proceeds, liquidation of assets, etc.) plus an amount to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution. In the event any payment is made due to an unforeseeable emergency, all deferral elections for the current Performance Year will cease and the participant will not be eligible to make any deferral elections under this Plan for the following Performance Year. For any participant receiving a hardship withdrawal under the Savings Plan, all deferral elections under this Plan for the current Performance Year will cease and the participant will not be eligible to make any deferral elections under this Plan for the following Performance Year. 
 
 5.3 Payment in the Event of Death . 
 
 (a) A participant may name the beneficiary of his or her choice on a beneficiary form provided by the Company or record keeper, and the beneficiary shall receive, within 90 days of the participant s death, in a single sum, all payments credited to the participant in the event that the participant dies prior to receipt of Deferred Annual Awards. If there is no beneficiary named at the time of participant s death or if the beneficiary does not survive the participant, the payment will be made to the participant s estate. In no event may any recipient designate a year of payment for an amount payable upon the death of the participant. 
 
 (b) A participant may change beneficiaries at any time, and the change will be effective as of the date the plan record keeper or the Company accepts the form 
 8 

as complete. The Company will not be liable for any payments made before receipt and acceptance of a written beneficiary request. 
 
 VI. CHANGE OF STATUS 
 
 Payments in the event of a change in status will not be made if no Annual Awards are made for the Performance Year. 
 
 6.1 Pro-Rata Annual Awards . A new Plan participant, whether hired or promoted to the position, or an Plan participant promoted to a higher salary grade or to an NorthStar Clean Energy Officer position during the Performance Year will receive a pro rata Annual Award based on the percentage of the Performance Year in which the employee is in a particular salary grade or NorthStar Clean Energy Officer position. An Plan participant whose salary grade has been lowered or who is no longer an NorthStar Clean Energy Officer, but whose employment is not terminated during the Performance Year, will receive a pro rata Annual Award based on the percentage of the Performance Year in which the employee is in a particular salary grade or NorthStar Clean Energy Officer position. Awards will also be prorated for any change in full time or part time work status. 
 
 6.2 Termination . An Plan participant whose employment is terminated pursuant to a violation of the Company code of conduct or other corporate policies will not be considered for or receive an Annual Award . 
 
 6.3 Resignation . An Plan participant who resigns prior to payment (during or after a Performance Year) will not be eligible for an Annual Award. If the resignation is due to reasons such as a downsizing or reorganization, or the ill health of the participant or ill health in the immediate family, the participant may petition the Plan Administrator and may be considered, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, for a pro rata Annual Award. The Plan Administrator's decision to approve or deny the request for a pro rata Annual Award shall be final. 
 
 6.4 Death, Disability, Retirement, Leave of Absence . An Plan participant whose status as an active employee or NorthStar Clean Energy Officer is changed during the Performance Year due to death, Disability, Retirement, or Leave of Absence (as determined by the Plan Administrator) will receive a pro rata Annual Award. An Plan participant whose employment is terminated following the Performance Year but prior to payment due to death, Disability or Retirement will continue to be eligible for an Annual Award for the Performance Year. Any such payment or Annual Award payable due to the death of the Plan participant will be made to the named beneficiary, or if no beneficiary is named or if the beneficiary doesn t survive the Plan participant, then to the Plan participant s estate no later than March 15 following the applicable Performance Year. Notwithstanding the above, an Plan participant who retires, is on Disability or Leave of Absence and who becomes employed by a competitor of CMS Energy or its subsidiaries or affiliates prior to award payout will forfeit all rights to an Annual Award, unless prior approval of such employment has been granted by the Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy. A competitor shall mean an entity engaged in the business of (1) selling (a) electric power or natural gas at retail or wholesale within the State of Michigan or (b) electric power at wholesale within the market area in which an electric generating plant owned by a subsidiary or affiliate of CMS Energy is located or (2) developing an electric generating plant within the State of Michigan or a market area in which an electric generating plant owned by a subsidiary or affiliate of CMS Energy is located. 
 9 

6.5 Payment Following Leave of Absence. Payment of an award for an Plan participant who is on leave of absence or Family Medical Leave Act leave at the time of payment shall be paid in the same payroll period as active participants. Payment of an award for an Plan participant who is laid-off at the time of payment shall be paid in the payroll period that is within an administratively reasonable time after returning to work, but no later than March 15 of the year following the year the participant has returned to work. 
 
 VII. MISCELLANEOUS 
 
 7.1 Impact on Benefit Plans . Payments for eligible participants made under the Plan will be considered as earnings for the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans but not for purposes of the Employees Savings Plan, Pension Plan, or other employee benefit programs. 
 
 7.2 Impact on Employment . Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the granting of any Annual Award under the Plan will be deemed to create any right in any individual to be retained or continued in the employment of the Company or any corporation within the Company s control group. 
 
 7.3 Termination or Amendment of the Plan . The Company may amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Upon termination, any Deferred Annual Award accrued under the Plan and vested will remain in the Plan and be paid out in accordance with the payment elections previously selected. The Plan Administrator is authorized to make any amendments that are deemed necessary or desirable to comply with any applicable laws, regulations or orders or as may be advised by counsel or to clarify the terms and operation of the Plan. The Company may terminate the Plan and accelerate any benefits under the Plan, at its discretion, if it acts consistent in all manners with the requirements of Code Section 409A and any applicable regulations with respect to when a terminated plan may accelerate payment to a participant. 
 
 7.4 Governing Law . The Plan will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan. 
 
 7.5 Dispute Resolution . Any disputes related to the Plan must be brought to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator is granted full discretionary authority to apply the terms of the Plan, make administrative rulings, interpret the Plan and make any other determinations with respect to the Plan. If the Plan Administrator makes a determination and the participant disagrees with or wishes to appeal the determination, the participant must appeal the decision to the Plan Administrator, in writing and not later than 60 days from when the determination was mailed to the participant. If the participant does not timely appeal the original determination, the participant has no further rights under the Plan with respect to the matter presented in the claim. If the participant appeals the original determination and that appeal does not result in a mutually agreeable resolution, then the dispute shall be subject to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator selected by the parties to be conducted in Jackson, Michigan, provided the participant makes such request for arbitration in writing within 30 days of the final decision by the Plan Administrator. The arbitration will be conducted and finished within 90 days of the selection of the arbitrator. The parties shall share equally the cost of the arbitrator and of conducting the arbitration proceeding, but each party shall bear the cost of its own legal counsel and experts and other out-of-pocket expenditures. The arbitrator must use an 
 10 

arbitrary and capricious standard of review when considering any determinations and findings by the Plan Administrator . 
 
 VIII. AMENDMENT TO REFLECT CODE SECTION 409A 
 
 8.1 Code Section 409A. To the extent counsel determines amendments may be reasonable or desirable in order to comply with Code Section 409A, and any other applicable rules, laws and regulations, such changes shall be authorized with the approval of the Plan Administrator.
