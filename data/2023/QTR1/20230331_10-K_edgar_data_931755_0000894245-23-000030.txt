PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

AEI Income Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership (the "Partnership" or the "Registrant") is a limited partnership which was organized pursuant to the laws of the State of Minnesota on August 22, 1994. The registrant is comprised of AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. AFM as Managing General Partner, the Estate of Robert P. Johnson as the Individual General Partner, and purchasers of partnership units as Limited Partners. The Partnership offered for sale up to 24,000,000 of limited partnership interests (the "Units") (24,000 Units at 1,000 per Unit) pursuant to a registration statement effective February 1, 1995. The Partnership commenced operations on April 14, 1995 when minimum subscriptions of 1,500 Limited Partnership Units 1,500,000) were accepted. On January 31, 1997, the Partnership offering terminated when the maximum subscription limit of 24,000 Limited Partnership Units 24,000,000) was reached. 

The Partnership was organized to acquire existing and newly constructed commercial properties located in the United States, to lease such properties to tenants under net leases, to hold such properties and to eventually sell such properties. From subscription proceeds, the Partnership purchased ten properties including partial interests in seven properties, at a total cost of 19,686,525. The balance of the subscription proceeds was applied to organization and syndication costs, working capital reserves and distributions, which represented a return of capital. The properties are commercial, single tenant buildings leased under net leases. 

The Partnership's properties were purchased without any indebtedness. The Partnership will not finance properties in the future to obtain proceeds for new property acquisitions. If it is required to do so, the Partnership may incur short-term indebtedness, which may be secured by a portion of the Partnership's properties, to finance day-to-day cash flow requirements (including cash flow necessary to repurchase Units). The amount of borrowings that may be secured by the properties is limited in the aggregate to 10 of the purchase price of all properties. The Partnership will not incur borrowings to pay distributions and will not incur borrowings while there is cash available for distributions. 

The Partnership will hold its properties until the General Partners determine that the sale or other disposition of the properties is advantageous in view of the Partnership's investment objectives. In deciding whether to sell properties, the General Partners will consider factors such as potential appreciation, net cash flow and income tax considerations. The Partnership expects to sell some or all of its properties prior to its final liquidation and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in additional properties. The Partnership reserves the right, at the discretion of the General Partners, to either distribute proceeds from the sale of properties to the Partners or to reinvest such proceeds in additional properties, provided that sufficient proceeds are distributed to the Limited Partners to pay federal and state income taxes related to any taxable gain recognized as a result of the sale. 

3

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. (Continued) 

In January 2021, the Managing General Partner mailed a Consent Statement (Proxy) seeking the consent of the Limited Partners to continue the Partnership for an additional 60 months or to initiate the final disposition, liquidation and distribution of all of the Partnership s properties and assets. On March 3, 2021, the votes were counted and neither proposal received the required majority vote. As a result, the Managing General Partner will continue the operations of the Partnership for an additional 60 months at which time it will ask the Limited Partners to vote on the same two proposals. 

Leases 

Although there are variations in the specific terms of the leases, the following is a summary of the general terms of the Partnership's leases. The properties are leased to tenants under net leases, classified as operating leases. Under a net lease, the tenant is responsible for real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and operating expenses for the property. For some leases, the Partnership is responsible for repairs to the structural components of the building, the roof, and the parking lot. At the time the properties were acquired, the remaining primary lease terms varied from 10 to 18 years. The leases provide the tenants with two to four five-year renewal options subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary term. The leases provide for base annual rental payments, payable in monthly installments, and contain rent clauses which entitle the Partnership to receive additional rent in future years based on stated rent increases. 

Property Activity During the Last Three Years 

As of December 31, 2019, the Partnership owned interests in six properties with a total cost of 12,432,671. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Partnership sold three property interests and received net sale proceeds of 1,465,286, 2,477,214, and 2,450,634 which resulted in net gains of 677,237, 13,198, and 1,268,078, respectively. During 2021, the Partnership expended 1,805,735 to purchase one additional property interest as it reinvested cash generated from property sales. During 2022, the Partnership expended 5,338,093 to purchase two additional property interests, one of which was related to an existing property, as it reinvested cash generated from property sales. As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership owned interests in five properties with a total cost of 14,057,497. 

Major Tenants 

During 2022, four tenants each contributed more than ten percent of the Partnership's total rental income. The major tenants in aggregate contributed 90 of total rental income in 2022. It is anticipated that, based on minimum rental payments required under the leases, each major tenant will continue to contribute more than ten percent of rental income in 2022. Additionally, the tenant Memorial Hospital in Diamondhead, Mississippi will become a major tenant because the property was purchased in 2022. Any failure of these major tenants could materially affect the Partnership's net income and cash distributions.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. (Continued) 

Competition 

The Partnership is a minor factor in the commercial real estate business. There are numerous entities engaged in the commercial real estate business which have greater financial resources than the Partnership. At the time the Partnership elects to dispose of its properties, the Partnership will be in competition with other persons and entities to find buyers for its properties. 

Employees 

The Partnership has no direct employees. Management services are performed for the Partnership by AEI Fund Management, Inc. (Management Company), an affiliate of AFM. For the past two fiscal years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Management Company has not made any reductions to employee compensation plans or employee benefit plans. 

The Management Company believes the people who work for the company are its most important resources and are critical to its continued success. The Management Company focuses significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support its operations. The Management Company s people are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of the Management Company s employees must adhere to a code of conduct that is outlined in AEI s employee handbook which sets standards for appropriate behavior which includes preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination. 

Compensation and Benefits 

The Management Company believes its compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in its industry. In addition to base pay, all eligible employees participate in the Management Company bonus program. The Management Company also offers employees a broad range of benefits, including medical, dental and ancillary health benefits and paid parental leave. 

Workplace Safety and Wellness 

The safety and well-being of the Management Companies employees is its priority. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Management Company implemented a COVID-19 Preparedness Plan which included safety protocols to assist in mitigating the risk of exposure to its employees and visitors. These protocols include complying with health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. Many of the Management Company s operational functions during this time have required modification, including most of its employees working remotely. The Management Company s experienced teams of people adapted to the changes in the work environment and have managed business successfully during this challenging time.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. 

Investment Objectives 

The Partnership's investment objectives are to acquire existing or newly-developed commercial properties throughout the United States that offer the potential for (i) regular cash distributions of lease income; (ii) growth in lease income through rent escalation provisions; (iii) preservation of capital through all-cash transactions; (iv) capital growth through appreciation in the value of properties; and (v) stable property performance through long-term lease contracts. The Partnership does not have a policy, and there is no limitation, as to the amount or percentage of assets that may be invested in any one property. However, to the extent possible, the General Partners attempt to diversify the properties by tenant and geographic location. 

Description of Properties 

The Partnership's properties are commercial, single tenant buildings. The properties were acquired on a debt-free basis and are leased to tenants under net leases, classified as operating leases. The Partnership holds an undivided fee simple interest in the properties. 

The Partnership's properties are subject to the general competitive conditions incident to the ownership of single tenant investment real estate. Since each property is leased under a long term lease, there is little competition until the Partnership decides to sell the property. At this time, the Partnership will be competing with other real estate owners, on both a national and local level, in attempting to find buyers for the properties. In the event of a tenant default, the Partnership would be competing with other real estate owners, who have property vacancies, to attract a new tenant to lease the property. The Partnership's tenants operate in industries that are competitive and can be affected by factors such as changes in regional or local economies, seasonality and changes in consumer preference.

The properties listed above with a partial ownership percentage are owned with the following affiliated entities: Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan (AEI Income Growth Fund 25 LLC) and Memorial Hospital in Diamondhead, Mississippi (AEI Net Lease Income Fund 36 LP). 

The Partnership accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-common with affiliated entities and/or unrelated third parties using the proportionate consolidation method. Each tenant-in-common owns a separate, undivided interest in the properties. Any tenant-in-common that holds more than a 50 interest does not control decisions over the other tenant-in-common interests. The financial statements reflect only this Partnership's percentage share of the properties' land, building, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 

At the time the properties were acquired, the remaining primary lease terms varied from 10 to 18 years. The leases provide the tenants with two to four five-year renewal options subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary term. The leases for the Best Buy store in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan were extended to end on January 19, 2028 and December 31, 2024 respectively. 

Pursuant to the lease agreements, the tenants are required to provide proof of adequate insurance coverage on the properties they occupy. The General Partners believe the properties are adequately covered by insurance and consider the properties to be well-maintained and sufficient for the Partnership's operations.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. (Continued) 

For tax purposes, the Partnership's properties are depreciated under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The largest depreciable component of a property is the building which is depreciated using the straight-line method over 39 years. The remaining depreciable component of a property is land improvements which are depreciated using an accelerated method over 15 years. Since the Partnership has tax-exempt Partners, the Partnership is subject to the rules of Section 168(h)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code which requires a percentage of the properties' depreciable components to be depreciated over longer lives using the straight-line method. In general, the federal tax basis of the properties for tax depreciation purposes equals the book depreciable cost of the properties plus the amortizable cost of the related intangible lease assets, except for properties purchased during 2009 through 2017. For those properties, acquisition expenses that were expensed for book purposes were capitalized and added to the basis of the property for tax depreciation purposes. 

At December 31, 2022, all properties listed above were 100 occupied.

(c) Pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Partnership Agreement, as amended, each Limited Partner has the right to present Units to the Partnership for purchase by submitting notice to the Managing General Partner during January or July of each year. The purchase price of the Units is equal to 95 of the net asset value per Unit, as of the first business day of January or July of each year, as determined by the Managing General Partner in accordance with the provisions of the Partnership Agreement. Units tendered to the Partnership during January and July may be repurchased on April 1st and October 1st, respectively, of each year subject to the following limitations. The Partnership will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 5 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Partnership. 

Units tendered to the Company during January and July may be repurchased on April 1 st and October 1 st , respectively, of each year subject to the following limitations. The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 2 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company. During the last three months of 2022, the Company did not purchase any Units. 

Other Information 

Effective April 11, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA implemented Rule 2310, a revised rule that requires securities broker-dealers to report on customer account statements the value of investment units of non-traded securities, such as REITs, LLCs and Limited Partnerships, provided that the per unit value is derived using methodology set forth by the rule. 

At December 31, 2022, the estimated value of the Partnership's Units was 866 per Unit. The Managing General Partner is the party responsible for the estimated value per Unit. The estimated value was derived using methodology that conforms to standard industry practice and based upon material assistance and/or confirmation by third-party valuation expert(s), in accordance with the appraised value method set forth in FINRA Rule 2340(c)(1)(B). 

9

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK- 

HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. 

In determining the estimated value of each property, the Managing General Partner relied on some or all of the following external information sources, as well as its own experience in the commercial, net leased property industry and knowledge of each property: 

Opinions of value from real estate brokerage firms 

Appraisal reports from independent commercial property appraisers 

Industry market reports from real estate brokerage and appraisal firms 

Market values from comparable properties listed for sale or recently sold 

Interviews with real estate brokers and tenants 

Tenant financial reports and other credit information, where available 

The per Unit value was the aggregate estimated value of the Partnership's assets less the Partnership's liabilities, and less the value attributable to the interest of the General Partners, divided by the number of Units outstanding. The Partnership's cash, receivables and liabilities were valued at face value as of September 30, 2022. Each of the Partnership's properties were valued by dividing their annual rental income as of December 1, 2022 by a capitalization rate the Managing General Partner believed, based upon the aforementioned valuation process, to be representative of the retail market for the sale of each property. The resulting value for each property was reviewed to determine that it also reflected circumstances that may have been unique to each specific property. For recently acquired properties, an appraisal report received at or near the time of acquisition from an independent commercial property appraiser was used to determine the value of the property. The appraisal report is used to value the property for approximately one year after the date of acquisition. The valuations were estimates only, and were based on a number of assumptions which may not be accurate or complete. In addition, property values are subject to change and could decline after the date of the valuations. Accordingly, this estimated value should not be viewed as the amount at which a Limited Partner may be able to sell units, or the fair market value of the Partnership properties, nor does it represent the amount of net proceeds Limited Partners would receive if the Partnership properties were sold and the proceeds distributed in a liquidation of the Partnership. 

The following table provides a breakdown of each major asset type, liabilities and the number of Units that were used to calculate the estimated value per Unit, using the methodology described above, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters. These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations, including the following: 

Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate; 

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the Partners; 

resolution by the General Partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the General Partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Partnership operate. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The Partnership s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Partnership s assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. It is possible that the carrying amount of the Partnership s assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate. 

Management of the Partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the Managing Partner of the Partnership. 

11

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties 

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Partnership records them in the financial statements at cost. The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the relative fair value of each component of the property. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management s assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset. 

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods. The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. Below market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income. 

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management s consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed. 

The determination of the relative fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables. If management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Carrying Value of Properties 

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Partnership tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties the Partnership will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value. For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value. Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties. 

Allocation of Expenses 

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund s affairs. They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund s operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund s capitalization relative to other funds they manage. The Partnership reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement. 

Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 

The Partnership is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues and investment property value. However, due to current economic factors, higher interest rates, and inflation in the US and globally, our tenants and operating partners may be impacted. 

Results of Operations 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership recognized rental income of 885,848 and 838,417, respectively. In 2022, rental income increased due to two property acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by the sale of one property in 2022 and 2021 each. Based on the scheduled rent for the properties owned as of February 28, 2023, the Partnership expects to recognize rental income of approximately 996,000 in 2023.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration expenses from affiliated parties of 138,597 and 157,584, respectively. These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Partners. During the same periods, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of 46,992 and 87,413, respectively. These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs. 

The Partnership owned a 30 interest in the Gander Mountain store in Champaign, Illinois. The remaining interests in the property were owned by affiliates of the Partnership. On March 10, 2017, Gander Mountain Company filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and announced it was closing the store, following a liquidation sale of its on site assets. In June 2017, the tenant filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the lease for this store effective June 30, 2017. At this time, the tenant returned possession of the property to the owners and the Partnership became responsible for its 30 share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property. The tenant paid rent through June 2017. 

On August 11, 2020, the Partnership entered into a lease agreement with a primary term of 10 years with Burlington Coat Factory of Texas, Inc.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

In July 2021, the Partnership entered into an agreement with the tenant of the Jared Jewelry store in Hanover, Maryland to extend the lease term seven years to end on January 31, 2029. As part of the agreement, the annual rent will decrease from 224,340 to 167,500 effective February 1, 2022. 

On May 14, 2021, the Partnership purchased an Advance Auto Parts store in Chelsea, Alabama for 1,802,200. The Partnership allocated 158,736 of the purchase price to Acquired Intangible Lease Assets, representing in-place lease intangibles. The property is leased to Advance Stores Company, Incorporated under a lease agreement with a remaining primary term of 10.4 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of 110,000. 

In August 2021, the Partnership entered into an agreement to sell its 30 interest in the Burlington Coat Factory and Five Below in Champaign, Illinois to an unrelated third party. On September 28, 2021, the sale closed with the Partnership receiving net proceeds of 2,477,214, which resulted in a net gain of 13,198. At the time of the sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was 3,178,923 and 714,907, respectively. 

In December 2021, the Partnership entered into an agreement to sell its 50 interest in the Jared Jewelry store in Hanover, Maryland to an unrelated third party. On February 14, 2022, the sale closed with the Partnership receiving net proceeds of 2,450,634, which resulted in a net gain of 1,268,078. At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was 1,989,135 and 806,579, respectively. 

On March 22, 2022, the Partnership purchased a 40 interest of the Memorial Hospital property in Diamondhead, Mississippi for 1,610,422. The Partnership allocated 114,052 of the purchase price to Acquired Lease Assets, representing in-place intangibles. The property is leased to Memorial Hospital at Gulfport, Incorporated under a lease agreement with a remaining primary term of 5.3 years (as of date of purchase) and annual rent of 100,320, scheduled to increase annually at 2 . 

On May 11, 2022, the Partnership purchased an additional 46 joint-venture interest in the Best Buy store in Eau Claire, Wisconsin for 3,726,043 from AEI Income Growth Fund 26 LLC, an affiliate of the Partnership. The purchase price of the property was based upon the property s fair market value as determined by an independent third party, commercial property appraiser. The property interest became available because AEI Income Growth Fund 26 LLC was in the process of liquidating its property portfolio. The Partnership now owns 100 interest in the property. The Partnership allocated 306,653 of the purchase price to Acquired Intangible Lease Assets, representing in-place lease intangibles. The annual rent for the additional 46 interest that was purchased is 240,432. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership recognized interest income of 2,518 and 3,608, respectively. 

15

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations. Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases. Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value. However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Partnership's cash balance decreased 3,030,757 primarily as a result of cash used for property and lease acquisition costs, distributions paid to the Partners, and cash used to repurchase units, which was partially offset by cash generated from the sale of a property. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership's cash balance decreased 1,082,540 primarily as a result of distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase units in excess of cash generated from operating activities and cash used for property and lease acquisition costs, which was partially offset by cash generated from the sale of a property. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 570,493 in 2021 to 816,752 in 2022 as a result of net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses in addition to an increase in total rental income in 2022, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest income. 

The major components of the Partnership's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership generated cash flow from the sale of real estate of 2,450,634 and 2,477,214, respectively. During the same periods, the Partnership expended 5,338,093 and 2,545,860, respectively, to invest in real properties. 

The Partnership's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Partners and cash used to repurchase Units. The Partnership declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter. The Partnership attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter. The Partnership may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations. 

16

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership declared distributions of 690,407 and 613,731, respectively, which were distributed 99 to the Limited Partners and 1 to the General Partners. The Limited Partners received distributions of 683,503 and 607,594 and the General Partners received distributions of 6,904 and 6,137 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The Partnership may repurchase Units from Limited Partners who have tendered their Units to the Partnership. Such Units may be acquired at a discount. The Partnership will not be obligated to purchase in any year any number of Units that, when aggregated with all other transfers of Units that have occurred since the beginning of the same calendar year (excluding Permitted Transfers as defined in the Partnership Agreement), would exceed 5 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Partnership. 

On April 1, 2022, the Partnership repurchased a total of 352.29 Units for 266,947 from 30 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. The Partnership acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations. On April 1, 2021, the Partnership repurchased a total of 843.97 Units for 610,604 from 36 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. The Partnership acquired these Units using net sales proceeds. On October 1, 2021, the Partnership repurchased a total of 518.17 Units for 389,248 from 39 Limited Partners. The Partnership acquired these Units using net sales proceeds. The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership. As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of 2,696 and 10,100 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Partnership obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Partners: 

AEI Income Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership 

St. Paul, Minnesota 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of AEI Income Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership (a Minnesota limited partnership) (the "Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, changes in partners capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. 

The registrant is a limited partnership and has no officers, directors, or direct employees. The General Partners manage and control the Partnership's affairs and have general responsibility and the ultimate authority in all matters affecting the Partnership's business. The General Partners are AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. AFM ), the Managing General Partner, and the Estate of Robert P. Johnson, the Individual General Partner. AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which the Robert P. Johnson Trust and Patricia Johnson own a majority interest. AFM has only one senior financial executive, its Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer reports directly to Marni J. Nygard, President of AFM, and Kevin Steele, Chief Operating Officer of AFM, and is accountable for his actions to both. Although AFM requires that all of its personnel, including the Chief Financial Officer, engage in honest and ethical conduct, ensure full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure, comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, and report to Ms. Nygard and Mr. Steele any deviation from these principles, because the organization is composed of only approximately 40 individuals, because the management of a company by an entity that has different interests in distributions and income than investors involves numerous conflicts of interest that must be resolved on a daily basis, and because the ultimate decision makers in all instances is Ms. Nygard and Mr. Steele, AFM has not adopted a formal code of conduct. Instead, the materials pursuant to which investors purchase Units disclose these conflicts of interest in detail and Ms. Nygard, as the President of AFM, and Mr. Steele, as Chief Operating Officer of AFM, resolve conflicts to the best of their ability, consistent with their fiduciary obligations to AFM and the fiduciary obligations of AFM to the Company. The director and officers of AFM are as follows:

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND 

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

The registrant, AFM and its affiliates have common management and utilize the same facilities. As a result, certain administrative expenses are allocated among these related entities. All of such activities and any other transactions involving the affiliates of the General Partner of the registrant are governed by, and are conducted in conformity with, the limitations set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement of the registrant. Reference is made to Note 3 of the Financial Statements, as presented, and is incorporated herein by reference, for details of related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
