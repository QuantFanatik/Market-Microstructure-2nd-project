PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Corporate Information Salem Media Group, Inc. is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC are available free of charge under the Investor Relations section of our website at www.salemmedia.com as soon as reasonably practical after electronically filed. Any information found on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this annual report or any other report of Salem filed with or furnished to the SEC. We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary. We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not include allocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in this annual report. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes, and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments. Business Strategy We are fundamentally committed to programming and content emphasizing Christian values, family themes, and conservative news. Our commitment to these values means that we may choose not to switch to other formats or pursue potentially more profitable business opportunities in response to changes in audience preferences. We pursue expansion opportunities for our integrated media platform while aggressively managing operating costs and cash flows to be a market leader for audiences, programmers, and advertisers in the religious and conservative media space. Our goal is to produce and deliver compelling content to audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. The means by which we deliver this content continues to evolve as new forms of content consumption emerge and grow in popularity. Our integrated multimedia platform includes traditional media, such as radio broadcasting and book publishing, and emerging forms of media including podcasts, mobile applications, websites, and digital publications. We continue to invest in and build websites, launch mobile and tablet applications, increase the strength and reach of our broadcast signals, promote our authors and on-air talent, and increase distribution and page views for our content. Our presence in each of these mediums provides advertisers and programmers with a powerful and integrated platform to reach audiences throughout the United States without compromising the sense of community involvement and branding that we generate through local events and promotions. Our recent expansion efforts included investing in an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. Broadcasting Our foundational business is the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets. We assemble market clusters, or multiple radio stations operating within the same geographic market, to achieve 
 2 

operational efficiencies. Several benefits are achievable when operating market clusters. First, we offer advertisers and programmers access to multiple audiences through airtime on each radio station in that market. Second, we realize cost and operating efficiencies by consolidating sales, technical and administrative support, promotional functions, and other shared overhead costs, such as facilities and rent, when possible. Third, additional radio stations in existing markets allows us to leverage our hands-on knowledge of that market to increase our appeal to new audiences and advertisers. We create and distribute programming content though our radio stations, our networks, and our broadcast digital operations that feature many of our national and local on-air hosts. Through Salem Surround, our full-service multimedia marketing agency, we provide state-of-the-art broadcast and digital marketing services to our customers. We also produce and deliver programming through the Salem Podcast Network SPN ), Salem News Channel SNC ), and OTT television network, and SalemNOW, an online destination with a wide variety of on-demand conservative and faith-based films. Through our Salem Influencer Network, we offer social media campaigns through influencers with highly engaged followers that see them as friends and count on them for trusted advice on a variety of topics. Digital Media The Internet, smartphones and tablets continue to change the way in which content and advertisements are delivered to audiences. Continual advancements with online search engines, social media and mobile applications provide consumers with numerous methods to locate specific content and information online. Digital media allows us to effectively deliver our content and to provide strategic marketing services to our customers. Our editorial staff, including our on-air personalities, provide digital commentaries, programs, text, audio, and video content that we believe to be knowledge-based, credible and reliable. We make strategic decisions to invest in website development, mobile applications and tablet applications given the ongoing shift in consumer demand. We continually seek opportunities to diversify our digital traffic sources to avoid reliance on any one provider. We offer custom digital product offerings, including tools for metasearch, retargeting, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. We also publish digital newsletters that provide market analysis and investment strategies for individual subscribers. Publishing We publish books and eBooks for audiences interested in Christian, family-themed, and conservative content and opinion. Our strategy to attract highly sought-after authors and high-profile Christian commentators expands our presence in the conservative and Christian media market and increases the likelihood of publishing books that appear on the best-seller lists. Equity Method Investment We invested in OnePartyAmerica LLC OPA ), an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. We accounted for our investment in OPA in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 323-30 , Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report. The documentary motion picture, 2000 Mules , was released in May 2022. After the theatrical release, the movie was made available through SalemNOW and other digital streaming services. Seasonality Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly fluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we 
 3 

experience increased demand for political advertising during election even numbered years, over non-election odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of contested issues. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which the Easter holiday is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of downloads from our church products websites. Audience Growth Our success depends on our ability to reach a growing audience. We seek audience growth opportunities by increasing the strength and number of our broadcast signals, increasing product offerings through digital marketing services, creating and distributing content through SPN and SNC, increasing the number of page-views through our digital media platforms, increasing book sales, and increasing the subscriber base for our digital content. Our audience growth is also contingent upon the desirability of our content to our audience. We produce and provide content that we believe is both compelling and of high commercial value. We rely on a combination of research, market testing and our understanding of our audience to target promotions and events that create visibility and brand awareness in each of our local markets. For maximum results, we cross-promote our content on each of our media platforms. By maximizing our audience share, we can achieve growth in ratings, growth in page views and growth in subscribers that we believe can be converted into revenue from programmers and advertisers that are interested in reaching our audience. Media Strategists We have assembled an effective, highly trained sales staff that is responsible for converting our audience into revenue. Media strategists are trained to provide integrated marketing strategies that include all of our media platforms and our full-service multimedia marketing agency. We operate a focused, sales-oriented culture that rewards selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure. Our media strategists create custom advertising campaigns and provide comprehensive solutions to our clients. Campaigns may include specific geographic coverage areas, event sponsorships, special promotions, e-mail sponsorships, print advertisements, and various digital media elements, including banner advertisements, site retargeting, search engine marketing, tools for metasearch, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. Significant Community Involvement We expect our public image to reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic groups that we serve. We regularly collaborate with organizations that serve Christian, conservative, and family-themed audiences as well as sponsor and support events that are important to these groups. We believe that our ongoing active involvement and our strong relationships within Christian and conservative communities provide us with a unique competitive advantage that significantly improves the marketability of our media platform to advertisers and programmers targeting such communities. We produce and sponsor a number of local events that we believe are important in building our brand identity. Our sponsored events include listener rallies, speaking tours, pastor appreciation events and concerts such as our Fishfest concerts. Local events such as these connect us with our audience and enable us to create an enhanced awareness and name recognition in each of our markets. We believe that this brand awareness creates loyalty with our audience and helps maximize our audience share and ratings over time. Corporate Structure Management of our operations is largely decentralized with regional vice presidents and general managers located throughout the United States. We believe that this decentralization encourages each general manager and vice president to apply innovative techniques for improving and growing their operations locally in ways that may become transferable to benefit other markets and operations. 
 4 

Our broadcast regional vice presidents, some of whom are also station general managers, are experienced radio broadcasters with expertise in sales, programming, marketing, and production. Each of our broadcast regional vice presidents oversees several markets on a regional basis. Our digital and publishing operations vice presidents and general managers are also located throughout the United States at various locations in which we operate. All our locations receive executive leadership and oversight from our corporate staff. Corporate staff members have experience and expertise in, among other things, accounting and finance, treasury, risk management, insurance, information technology, human resources, legal, engineering, real estate, strategic direction, and other support functions designed to provide resources to local management. Corporate staff also oversee the placement and rate negotiations for national block programming on our stations. Centralized oversight of national programming is necessary because many of our key programming partners purchase time in multiple radio markets. Environmental Compliance Our business activities as a media company and content provider have minimal environmental risks, however, we recognize the importance of protecting the environment. As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds. Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored, or disposed of at certain of those facilities. In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored, or disposed of hazardous substances. As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us. We believe that none of our properties have any environmental condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Human Capital As of February 10, 2023, we employed 1,436 total employees of which 1,147 were full time and 289 were part time. These employees consist of 975 in broadcasting, 172 in digital media, 96 in publishing, and 193 corporate employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The average tenure for all of our employees is 8 years. We employ on-air personalities and may enter into employment agreements with these on-air personalities in order to protect our interests in these relationships. However, on-air talent may be lost to competitors for a variety of reasons. While we do not believe that the loss of any one of our on-air personalities would adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, the loss of several key on-air personalities combined could adversely affect our business. The loss of any of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. Our continued success depends on contributions from our employees and senior management team. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic During 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we had adequate liquidity to meet our debt servicing requirements. As the economy began to show signs of recovery, we reversed several of these cost reduction initiatives during 2021. We continue to operate with lower staffing levels where appropriate, we have not declared or paid dividends or equity distributions on our common stock since December 2019, and the company 401(k) match was not reinstated until January 2022. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act provided emergency economic assistance for individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including opportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act CAA included a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act and the CAA, including: 

We deferred 3.3 million of employer FICA taxes from April 2020 through December 2020, of which approximately 50 was paid in December 2021 and the remainder was paid in December 2022; 

A relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; 

We received Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans of 11.2 million in total during the first quarter of 2021 through the Small Business Association SBA based on the eligibility as determined on a per-location basis; and 

In July 2021, the SBA forgave all but 20,000 of the PPP loans, with the remaining PPP loan repaid in July 2021. Recent Developments On September 26, 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement in connection with a lawsuit. While we denied the allegations made in the lawsuit, we believed that settling the matter was preferable to protracted and costly litigation. During mediation the parties reached a settlement whereby we paid 5.3 million of cash in December 2022, in exchange for a release by the plaintiff of all claims. We invested in OPA, an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. The documentary motion picture, 2000 Mules , was released in May 2022. We recorded 4.1 million of earnings from our equity investment in OPA during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, 0.1 million is included in other receivables in our Consolidated Balance sheet representing our share of profit from the documentary motion picture due from OPA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed or entered into the following transactions: Debt Transactions We completed repurchases of our 6.75 Senior Secured Notes 2024 Notes as follows:

Acquisitions On December 30, 2022, we acquired the book inventory and publishing rights to many book titles, including a series of well-known Student Guides of Intercollegiate Studies Institute ISI Publishing for 0.4 million of cash. On December 2, 2022, we acquired radio station KKOL-AM in Seattle, Washington for 0.5 million in cash. We paid 0.4 million of cash at closing and 0.1 million paid from an escrow account. We have been operating the station under a Local Marketing Agreement LMA since June 7, 2021. On October 1, 2022, we acquired websites and the related assets of DayTradeSPY, a financial publication, for 0.6 million in cash. As part of the purchase agreement, we may pay up to an additional 1.0 million of cash in contingent earn-out consideration within one year of the closing date based on the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks. On May 2, 2022, we acquired websites and the related assets of Retirement Media for 0.2 million in cash. We recorded goodwill of approximately 2,400 associated with the expected synergies to be realized upon combining the operations into our digital media platform within Eagle Financial Publications. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the operating results of this entity as of the closing date within our digital media segment. On May 1, 2022, we began operating radio station WYDB-FM in Dayton, Ohio under a Time Brokerage Agreement TBA. On February 15, 2022, we acquired radio station WLCC-AM and an FM translator in the Tampa, Florida market for 0.6 million of cash. The WLCC transmitter site will be used to diplex radio station WTBN-AM due to our sale of the WTBN-AM transmitter site. Divestitures On June 27, 2022, we sold 9.3 acres of land in the Denver, Colorado area for 8.2 million in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain of 6.5 million. The land was being used as the transmitter site for radio stations KRKS-AM and KBJD-AM and was an integral part of our broadcast operations for these stations. We will continue broadcasting both KRKS-AM and KBJD-AM from this site via a perpetual agreement with the buyer. On May 25, 2022, we sold radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for 4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including a portion of the monthly fees paid under a TBA. We recorded a pre-tax gain of 0.5 million in connection with this sale. On January 10, 2022, we closed on the sale of 4.5 acres of land in Phoenix, Arizona for 2.0 million in cash. The land was being used as the transmitter site for radio station KXXT-AM and was an integral part of our broadcast operations for that station. We recorded a pre-tax gain of 1.8 million on the sale and had access to the land for 90-days to relocate our transmitter equipment for KXXT-AM. We continue to operate radio station KXXT-AM with a similar broadcast signal. Pending Transactions On December 20, 2022, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement APA to acquire the George Gilder Report and other digital newsletters and related website assets. We assumed the deferred subscription liabilities, resulting in us paying no cash at the time of closing on February 1, 2023. The purchase price is 25 of net revenue generated from sales of most Eagle Financial products during the one-year period after closing to people who are on George Gilder subscriber lists that are not already on Eagle Financial lists.

The acquisition closed on January 6, 2023. Salem s executive officers, who have no relationship with the related party, began negotiations for the related party lease agreements and option agreements, subject to final approval by Salem s Audit Committee pursuant to its related party transaction policy. The option to purchase real estate agreement was approved by Salem s Audit Committee on March 1, 2023.

In June 2022 we entered into agreements to sell radio stations KLFE-AM and KNTS-AM in Seattle, Washington for 0.7 million subject to approval of the Federal Communications Commission FCC. Radio station KLFE-AM is being programmed by the buyer under a TBA since August 1, 2022. Broadcasting Our broadcasting segment includes the operating results of our radio stations, networks, podcasts, news channels, video-on-demand, and our national sales agencies including Salem Surround, our full-service multimedia agency. National companies often prefer to advertise across the United States as an efficient and cost-effective way to reach their target audiences. Our national platform under which we offer radio airtime and digital campaigns can benefit national companies by reaching audiences throughout the United States. Radio Stations As of the date of this annual report, we own and/or operate 103 radio stations in 36 markets, including 63 radio stations in 23 of the top 25 markets in the United States, consisting of 33 FM radio stations and 70 AM radio stations. We also program the Family Talk Christian-themed talk format station on SiriusXM Channel 131. We are one of only three commercial radio broadcasters with radio stations in all the top 25 U.S. markets. We are the third largest commercial radio broadcaster in the United States as measured by number of radio stations and the third largest operator as measured by number of stations in the top 25 U.S. markets. We program our radio stations in three main formats: (1) Christian Teaching and Talk, (2) News Talk and (3) Contemporary Christian Music CCM ). Other radio station formats include Spanish language Christian Teaching and Talk, Business, Country, Urban, and Classic Hits. Christian Teaching and Talk. We currently program 39 of our radio stations in our foundational format, Christian Teaching and Talk, which is talk programming emphasizing Christian and family themes. Through this format, a listener can hear Bible teachings and sermons, as well as gain insight to questions related to daily life, such as raising children or religious legal rights in education and in the workplace. This format uses block programming time to offer a learning resource and a source of personal support for listeners. Listeners often contact our programmers to donate to their organizations, ask questions and obtain materials on a subject matter or receive study guides based on what they have learned on the radio. Block Programming . We recognize revenue from the sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically consist of 12 1 / 2 , 25 or 50-minutes of time. We sell blocks of airtime on our Christian Teaching 
 8 

and Talk format stations to a variety of national and local religious and charitable organizations that we believe create compelling radio programs. National programmers, such as established non-profit religious and educational organizations, typically purchase time on a Monday through Friday basis with supplemental programming blocks available for weekend release. Local programmers, such as community churches and organizations, typically purchase blocks for weekend releases. Historically, more than 95 of these national religious and charitable organizations renew their annual programming relationships with us. Based on our historical renewal rates, we believe that block programming provides a steady and consistent source of revenue and cash flows. Our top ten programmers have remained relatively constant and average more than 30 years on-air with us. Over the last five years, block-programming has generated 38 to 42 of our total net broadcast revenue. Satellite Radio . We program SiriusXM Channel 131, the exclusive Christian Teaching and Talk channel on SiriusXM, reaching the entire nation 24 hours a day, seven days a week. News Talk. We currently program 32 of our radio stations in a News Talk format. Our research shows that our News Talk format is highly complementary to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format. As programmed by Salem, both formats express conservative views and family values. Our News Talk format allows us to leverage syndicated talk programming produced by Salem Radio Network TM SRN TM to radio stations throughout the United States. Syndication of our programs allows us to reach audiences in markets in which we do not own or operate radio stations. Contemporary Christian Music. We currently program 12 of our radio stations in a Contemporary Christian Music CCM format, branded The FISH in most markets. Through the CCM format, we bring listeners the words of inspirational recording artists, set to upbeat contemporary Christian music. Our music format is branded Safe for the Whole Family , and features sounds and lyrics for listeners of all ages to enjoy and appreciate.

Broadcast revenue includes radio advertising spots, programming revenue, digital revenue from each of our radio station websites, digital email blasts, Salem Surround revenue, event revenue, and network advertising revenue. The principal source of network broadcast revenue is from the sale of spot advertising time.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived 20.9 of our net broadcast revenue, or 43.0 million, from the sale of local spot advertising and 7.5 of our net broadcast revenue, or 15.4 million, from the sale of national spot advertising.

Salem Books books to help people grow in their faith and find comfort, encouragement, practical advice, and timeless wisdom in compelling books by trusted authors. Salem Author Services is a self-publishing service for authors through two imprints: Xulon Press and Mill City Press. Xulon Press offers print-on-demand self-publishing services for Christian authors while Mill City Press serves general market authors. Competition We operate in a highly competitive broadcast and media business. We compete for audiences, advertisers, and programmers with other radio broadcasters, broadcast and cable television operators, newspapers and magazines, book publishers, national and local digital services, outdoor advertisers, direct mail services, online marketing and media companies, social media platforms, web-based blogs, and mobile devices. BROADCASTING . Our broadcast audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any change in a particular market could adversely affect the revenue of our stations located in that market. While we already compete in some of our markets with stations that offer similar formats, if another radio station were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of ours, or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations, our stations could suffer reduced ratings and/or reduced revenue. In these circumstances, we could also incur significantly higher promotional and other related expenses. We cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current audience ratings and revenue. We compete for advertising revenue with other commercial religious and conservative format stations as well as general format radio stations. Our competition for advertising dollars includes other radio stations as well as digital websites and social media, broadcast television, cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and billboard advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies. Several factors can materially affect competitive advantage, including, but not limited to, audience ratings, program content, management talent and expertise, sales talent and experience, audience characteristics, signal strength, and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the same market. Christian and Family-Themed Radio. The broadcast segment that focuses on Christian and family themes is also highly competitive. The financial success of each of our radio stations that focuses on Christian Teaching and Talk is dependent, to a significant degree, upon its ability to generate revenue from the sale of block program time to national and local religious and educational organizations. We compete for this program revenue with a number of different commercial and non-commercial radio station licensees. While we believe that no commercial group owner in the United States specializing in Christian and family-themed programming approaches Salem in size of potential listening audience and presence in major markets, other religious radio stations exist and enjoy varying degrees of prominence and success in some of our markets. New Methods of Content Delivery . Competition from new media technologies and services continues to evolve. Content delivery includes audio programming by cable television and satellite systems, digital audio services, mobile devices including smart phone applications for iPhone and Android , personal communications services, social media, and the service of low powered, limited coverage FM radio stations authorized by the FCC. The delivery of live and stored audio programming through the Internet creates new forms of competition. In addition, satellite delivered digital audio radio, which delivers multiple audio programming formats to national audiences, creates competition. We address these existing and potential competitive threats through an active strategy to acquire and integrate new electronic communications formats including digital acquisitions, the launch of Salem Surround, and our exclusive arrangement to provide Christian and family-themed talk on SiriusXM, which is the largest satellite digital audio radio service in the U.S. 
 17 

NETWORK. SRN TM competes with other commercial radio networks that offer news and talk programming to religious and general format stations and noncommercial networks that offer Christian music formats. SRN TM also competes with other radio networks for the services of talk show personalities. DIGITAL MEDIA. SWN and Townhall Media compete for visitors and advertisers with other companies that deliver online audio programming, that deliver Christian and conservative digital content, as well as provide general market websites and social media. The online media and distribution business changes quickly and is highly competitive. We compete to attract and maintain interactions with advertisers, consumers, content creators and web publishers. Salem Church Products competes for customers with other online sites that offer resources useful in ministries, preaching, teaching, and for employment within the Christian community. PUBLISHING. Regnery Publishing competes with other book publishers for readers and book sales as well as on criteria such as product quality, customer service, suitability of format and subject matter, author reputation, price, timely availability of both new titles and revisions of existing books, digital availability of published products, and timely delivery of products to customers. Salem Author Services competes for authors with other on-demand publishers including those focused exclusively on Christian book publishers. Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting Introduction . The ownership, operation, and sale of broadcast stations, including those licensed to Salem, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority derived from The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder Communications Act ). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines whether to approve certain changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission facilities, including power employed, antenna and tower heights, and location of transmission facilities; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act. The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of short (less than the maximum) license renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of a license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC. License Grant and Renewal . Radio broadcast licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years. Licenses must be renewed through an application to the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC will renew a broadcast license if it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity, that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC, and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. From time to time, the renewal of certain licenses may be delayed. We continue to operate these radio stations under their existing licenses until the licenses are renewed. The affected stations are authorized to continue operations until the FCC acts upon the renewal applications. We continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are necessary for the FCC renewal. Each of our broadcast licenses was successfully renewed as part of the FCC s most recent radio renewal cycle, which is now concluded. Petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by certain interested parties, including members of the public in a station s market. Such petitions may raise various issues before the FCC. The FCC is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the FCC is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public 
 18 

interest, convenience, and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises a substantial and material question of fact as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In addition, during certain periods when a renewal application is pending, the transferability of the applicant s license is restricted. The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license as of the date of this annual report. Stations that we operate under an LMA or TBA are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the Effective Radiated Power ERP of the radio station s antenna and the Height Above Average Terrain HAAT of the radio station s antenna.

 Radio station KNTS-AM is an expanded band station paired with station KLFE-AM in the Seattle, WA market, and station KBJD-AM is an expanded band station paired with KRKS-AM in the Denver, CO market. We are operating these four stations pursuant to FCC licenses or other FCC authority pending resolution by the FCC of the issue of AM expanded band dual operating authority. Depending upon how the FCC resolves that issue, it is possible that we will be required to surrender one station license in each station pair. Except for these stations, we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, although there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed. 

2. 
 As part of an agreement between Salem and the FCC to allow a Salem subsidiary to acquire the license for KKOL(AM) despite objections to the sale and the then-pending license renewal, the FCC renewed the station s license for a four-year, rather than eight-year, period to assess Salem s commitment to continue to mitigate instances of blanketing interference as the station s licensee.

Ownership Matters . The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to assign, transfer, grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests therein, and compliance with the Communications Act s limitation on alien ownership, as well as compliance with other FCC policies, including equal employment opportunity requirements. FCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as attributable interests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations and other specified mass media entities. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and indirect parents; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly insulated from management activities; (4) a 5 or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a corporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20 or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33 of a licensee s total asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15 of the licensee station s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-service (radio or television) broadcast or newspaper interest in the same market EDP Rule ). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15 of the broadcast time or sells more than 15 per week of the advertising time on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an attributable interest in that station. Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited partnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule. The FCC ownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below. Because of these rules, a purchaser of voting stock of the company that acquires an attributable interest in the company may violate the FCC s rule if it also has an attributable interest in another radio station, depending on the number and location of those radio stations. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the other companies in which it may invest, to the extent that these investments give rise to an attributable interest. If an attributable stockholder of the company violates any of these ownership rules, the company may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. Foreign Ownership: Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by a corporation that has more than one-fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. Under the Communications Act, there are limitations on the licensee of a broadcast license that is held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We, therefore, may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted by aliens, foreign governments, or non-U.S. corporations, although the FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25 indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies. The FCC generally will not make such a determination absent favorable executive branch review. Local Radio Ownership : The maximum allowable number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio service (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the 
 23 

same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50 of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. Our current ownership of radio broadcast stations complies with the FCC s multiple ownership rules; however, these rules may limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets. Cross-Ownership : In 2021, the FCC eliminated its prohibition on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and its rule limiting common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. Review of Media Ownership Rules : The Communications Act requires the FCC to periodically review its media ownership rules, and those reviews have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and follow-on regulatory proceedings. In November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a decision that resulted in reinstatement of rules restricting cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast radio (or television) stations, and of broadcast radio and television stations, which the FCC had previously eliminated. The Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Third Circuit s decision in April 2021, and the rules prohibiting cross-ownership are therefore not currently in effect. In December 2018, the FCC commenced its 2018 quadrennial review of its media ownership regulations. In June 2021, following the Supreme Court decision described above, the FCC sought comment to refresh the record in its 2018 quadrennial review. Without concluding the 2018 quadrennial review, the FCC issued a public notice in December 2022 commencing a new quadrennial review as required by statute. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule including whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. The National Association of Broadcasters NAB has asked for a temporary toll of the 2022 review until the 2018 quadrennial review is complete. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC s media ownership proceedings or their effects on our business in the future. Federal Antitrust Considerations . The Federal Trade Commission FTC and the Department of Justice DOJ ), which evaluate transactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws, are also active in their review of radio station acquisitions, particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets. For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder require the parties to the acquisitions to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other assets of either party to the acquisition. The FTC or the DOJ may investigate acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act under federal antitrust laws either before or after consummation of the transaction. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that LMAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. We can provide no assurances that our acquisition strategy will not be adversely affected in any material respect by antitrust reviews.

Geographic Financial Information Our customers are based in various locations throughout the United States. While no one customer currently accounts for 10 or more of our total revenue individually or in the aggregate, our broadcast operating segment is particularly dependent on revenue generated from our Los Angeles and Dallas broadcast markets. Our Los Angeles radio stations generated 9.4 of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 10.1 of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Dallas radio stations generated 7.9 of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 9.0 of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Because substantial portions of our broadcast revenue are derived from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns in these areas. Available Information Our Internet address is www.salemmedia.com. We make available free of charge on our investor relations website under the heading SEC Filings, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file them or furnish them to the SEC. Any information found on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Not required for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. We own or lease various properties throughout the United States from which we conduct business. No one physical property is material to our overall business operations. The types of properties required to support each of our radio stations, digital media and publishing operations typically include offices, studios, and tower sites where broadcasting transmitters and antenna equipment are located. The majority of our office, studio and tower facilities are leased pursuant to long-term leases. We believe that each of our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to upgrade our properties. We believe that we will be able to renew existing leases when applicable or obtain comparable facilities, as necessary. Executive Offices Our executive offices are located in Irving, Texas, where we own an approximately 43,000 square foot office building. Broadcasting Our broadcast facilities include offices and studios, transmitter locations, antenna sites and tower sites. Offices and studios are typically located in buildings that are in a downtown or business district. Transmitter, antenna, and tower sites are located in areas that provide maximum market coverage. Our radio stations broadcast from 90 tower sites, including 28 tower sites in which we own the land. We own the land for seven additional tower sites that are not currently leased by us and are leased or available to lease to other broadcasters. 
 25 

SRN TM , SMR, Salem Consumer Products, our Dallas radio stations studios and offices, and our executive offices are located in the Dallas, Texas metropolitan area. We also own office buildings in Honolulu, Hawaii; Tampa, Florida; Orlando, Florida and Greenville, South Carolina from which our radio stations studios and offices operate. Our national radio network operates from various offices and studios. These studios may be used to generate programming or, alternatively, programming can also be relayed from a remote point of origination. Our network also leases satellite transponders used for program delivery. Our current lease agreements for these facilities range from ten months to twenty-six years remaining on the lease term. We lease certain property from our principal stockholders or trusts and partnerships created for the benefit of the principal stockholders and their families. These leases are described in Note 16, Related Party Transactions in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report. While none of our owned or leased properties are individually material to our operations, if we were required to relocate any of our broadcast towers, the cost would be significant. Significant costs are due to the moving and reconstruction of the tower as well as the limited number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide adequate market coverage. These limitations are due to zoning and other land use restrictions, as well as Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations. Digital Media Our digital media entities operate from office buildings and require additional data storage centers. SWN operates from leased office facilities in Richmond, Virginia and Nashville, Tennessee. Townhall Media operates from a leased facility in Arlington, Virginia that is shared with our local radio stations and Eagle Financial Publications. Our current lease agreements for these facilities range from four to five years remaining on the lease term. Publishing Regnery Publishing operates from a leased facility in Washington, D.C. with inventory fulfillment managed by a third-party in Delran, New Jersey. Salem Author Services operates from a leased facility in Orlando, Florida. Our current lease agreements for these facilities range from six months to four years remaining on the lease term. Corporate Certain corporate administrative functions are performed in Camarillo, California where we own an approximately 46,000 square foot office building. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We and our subsidiaries, incident to our business activities, are parties to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitrations and other claims. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. We believe, at this time, that the final resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. ITEM 4. MINE AND SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not Applicable.

 There is no established public trading market for the company s Class B common stock. DIVIDEND POLICY Our dividend policy is based upon our Board of Directors current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate. The actual declaration of any future equity distributions and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates, and payment dates are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors and dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other factors. The reduction or elimination of equity distributions may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. On May 6, 2020, our Board of Directors voted to discontinue distributions on our common stock indefinitely due to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our sole source of cash available for making any future dividends or equity distributions on our common stock is our operating cash flow subject covenants under our indebtedness that restrict the payment of dividends and equity distributions unless certain specified conditions are satisfied. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 6. [RESERVED]. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. General The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes under Item 8 of this annual report. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly comparable from period to period due to acquisitions and dispositions. Refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report for details of each of these transactions. We have elected the presentation requirements under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act as a smaller reporting company and have herein included a two-year discussion of our financial condition and results of operations.

Because these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. In addition, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise, except as required by law. Overview Salem is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. We maintain a website at www.salemmedia.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as 
 28 

reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary. We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes, and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments. Our principal sources of broadcast revenue include: 

the sale of block program time to national and local program producers; 

the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers; 

the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; 

the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; 

the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; 

fees earned for the creation of custom digital media campaigns and websites for our customers through Salem Surround; 

the sale of advertising time on our national network; 

the syndication of programming on our national network; 

the sale of advertising time through podcasts and video-on-demand services; 

product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, podcasts, programs and media content including documentary motion pictures, films; and 

other revenue such as events, including ticket sales and sponsorships, listener purchase programs, where revenue is generated from special discounts and incentives offered to our listeners from our advertisers; talent fees for voice-overs or custom endorsements from our on-air personalities and production services, and rental income for studios, towers or office space. Our principal sources of digital media revenue include: 

the sale of digital banner advertisements on our websites and mobile applications; 

the sale of digital streaming advertisements on websites and mobile applications; 

the support and promotion to stream third-party content on our websites; 

the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; 

the digital delivery of newsletters to subscribers; and 

the number of video and graphic downloads. Our principal sources of publishing revenue include: 

the sale of books and e-books; 

publishing fees from authors; and 

the sale of digital advertising in digital newsletters. 
 29 

In each of our operating segments, the rates we can charge for airtime, advertising and other products and services are dependent upon several factors, including: 

audience share; 

how well our programs and advertisements perform for our clients; 

the size of the market and audience reached; 

the number of impressions delivered; 

the number of advertisements and programs streamed; 

the number of page views achieved; 

the number of downloads completed; 

the number of events held, the number of event sponsorships sold and the attendance at each event; 

demand for books and publications; 

general economic conditions; and 

supply and demand for airtime on a local and national level. Broadcasting Our foundational business is radio broadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets, our national networks and our national sales firms, including Salem Surround. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of our broadcasting operations. Revenue generated from our radio stations, networks, and sales firms is reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. Broadcast revenue is impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and advertisers, the number of impressions delivered, or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio, which develops monthly reports measuring a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time available for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day. Nielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM PPM technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio, television, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter time periods between when advertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the PPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the panel (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of listeners at any given time. We subscribe to Nielsen Audio for ratings services in seven of our broadcast markets.

Our results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly fluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for political advertising during election even numbered years, over non-election odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues. Our cash flows from broadcasting may be affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market, or other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period, when we develop a radio station s listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow. In broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, 99 of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash. Broadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities. Digital Media Our digital media segment provides Christian, conservative, investing, retirement, e-commerce, audio and video streaming, and other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations. Revenue generated from this segment is reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations under Item 8 of this annual report. Digital media revenue is impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered, or the number of products sold, and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our broadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue from our digital media segment generally exceeds the segment s first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which Easter is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product websites. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements. The primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold associated with e-commerce sites. 
 31 

Publishing Our publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery Publishing and self-publishing services through Salem Author Services. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a detailed description of our publishing operations. Revenue generated from this segment is reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Publishing revenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery Publishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions. The primary operating expenses incurred by our publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes book printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves. Known Trends and Uncertainties Ongoing global supply chain disruptions from the pandemic, military conflict in Ukraine, increases in consumer prices, persistent inflation, and the Federal Reserve s raising of the federal funds interest rate may have a material adverse impact on our business. To the extent that any of these factors interfere with our customers advertising and promotional spending, we could experience reductions in revenue growth rates and increasing pressure to contain costs. Reductions in revenue could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and results of operations. These uncertainties could materially impact significant accounting estimates related to, but not limited to, allowances for doubtful accounts, impairments, and right-of-use assets. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. We have experienced increases in lease expense associated with escalations tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index CPI and higher variable costs associated with Common Area Maintenance CAM charges. CPI increased 6.5 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, following a 7.0 increase for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021. Higher energy costs and the impact of inflation resulted in higher CAM charges. Lease expense increased 0.2 million on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year, including a 0.9 million increase from CAM and CPI, that was offset with a 0.7 million reduction from consolidating select locations and reducing rental space. Revenue growth from the sale of broadcast airtime is negatively impacted by audiences spending less time commuting, certain automobile manufacturers removing AM radio signals, increases in other forms of content distribution, and decreases in the length of time spent listening to broadcast radio as compared to audio streaming services, podcasts, and satellite radio. These factors may lead advertisers to conclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. We continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increased use of smart speakers and other voice activated platforms that provide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations offers potential sources for radio broadcasters to reach audiences. Our broadcast spot advertising revenue is particularly dependent on advertising from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 12.8 and 19.3 , respectively, of our total net broadcast spot advertising revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 13.6 and 21.1 , respectively, of our total net broadcast spot advertising revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views and the number of advertisements appearing on each page view. While page views continue to show growth, the number of page views from desktop devices continue to decline in favor of page views from mobile devices. Page views from mobile devices carry a lower 
 32 

number of advertisements per page and are generally sold at lower rates. The shift from desktop page views to mobile device views negatively impacts revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. We also experience declines in page views from changes in algorithms, including algorithms that limit political content and from browsers that block third-party cookies limiting advertising delivery. Key Financial Performance Indicators Same-Station Definition In the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an as-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitions and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks, and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP. Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain non-GAAP financial information may be presented in this annual report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income SOI ), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses, Same Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends, and performance. The performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. SOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media, entertainment, and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews for potential impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. SOI does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance 
 33 

with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station results for each of the four quarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period-over-period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net digital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Income (Loss) is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our operating results reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal reviews for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. This measurement does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income (Loss) are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the disposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before impairments, before debt modification costs, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: In the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and broadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of SOI and Same Station Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income (Loss). Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP. In the table below, we present our calculations of Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income. Our presentation of these non-GAAP performance indicators are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 The following factors affected our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year: On September 26, 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement in connection with a lawsuit. While we denied the allegations made in the lawsuit, we believed that settling the matter was preferable to protracted and costly litigation. During mediation the parties reached a settlement whereby we paid 5.3 million of cash in December 2022, in exchange for a release by the plaintiff of all claims. We invested in OPA, an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. The documentary motion picture, 2000 Mules , was released in May 2022. We recorded 4.1 million of earnings from our equity investment in OPA during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, 0.1 million is included in other receivables in our Consolidated Balance sheet representing our share of profit from the documentary motion picture due from OPA.

Block programming revenue increased 6.7 to 78.4 million from 73.4 million, due to increases in rates during our 2022 annual renewals and a higher demand from the expansion of existing programs and the launch of new programs. Higher demand can result in an increase in rates, particularly if premium time slots are sold out. National programming from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations increased 4.5 million followed by our News Talk format stations that increased 0.3 million. Local programming increased 0.1 million including a 0.3 million increase on our News Talk format radio stations offset by a 0.2 million decrease from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations. Advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, or net advertising revenue, increased 4.2 , or 2.4 million, to 58.3 million from 56.0 million, driven by a 7.5 increase in national spots and a 3.1 increase in local spots. The increase reflects the impact of political revenue, which generated 3.4 million of revenue 2.0 million national and 1.4 million local) in 2022 compared to 0.9 million 0.5 million national and 0.4 million local) 
 39 

in 2021, or an increase of 2.6 million. Excluding the impact of political, net advertising revenue declined 0.4 to 54.9 million from 55.1 million. Revenue from our News Talk format stations was 18.9 million compared to 16.6 million in the prior year, an increase of 2.3 million. Our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations generated 8.1 million of revenue compared to 8.0 million and other format radio stations generated 4.7 million of revenue compared to 4.2 million. Our CCM format radio stations decreased to 26.3 million of revenue from 26.8 million. We experienced a higher demand for advertising during the first half of 2022 followed by lower demand in the second half as economic concerns resulted in limited advertising spending. Broadcast digital revenue, net of agency commissions, or net digital revenue generated from our broadcast markets and networks, increased 15.1 , or 4.9 million. The increase includes 3.4 million from a higher demand for digital marketing services through Salem Surround, 0.8 million of revenue generated from SalemNOW, our video-on-demand service through Salem Consumer Products, which received distribution fees from 2000 Mules , the documentary motion picture we invested in during 2022, a 0.6 million increase from Salem Podcast Network, a 0.5 million increase in streaming revenue, a 0.3 million increase from Salem News Channel, and a 0.2 million increase in digital advertising revenue on our station websites that was offset by a 0.9 million decrease from our network. There were no significant changes in digital rates as compared to the prior year. Infomercial revenue declined by 0.1 million due to a reduction in the number of infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the infomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience. Network revenue, net of amounts reported as digital, increased 9.1 , or 1.8 million, including a 0.5 million increase in political advertising and a 1.3 million increase from our nationally syndicated host programs. Other revenue decreased 0.4 , or 37,000, including a 0.8 million increase in event revenue that was offset with a 0.4 million decrease in listener purchase program revenue from lower half price tuition sales, a 0.2 million decrease in rental income, and a 0.2 million decrease from the impact on the prior year of the sale of an integrated marketing campaign to our advertiser that included television and billboards. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of events, audience demand, any applicable local COVID-19 restrictions, and in some cases, the weather which can affect attendance. On a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue increased 13.7 million, which reflects the above-described items net of the impact of stations acquired, stations disposed of, and stations with format changes.

Digital advertising revenue net of agency commissions, or national net digital revenue, decreased 8.6 , or 1.7 million, including a 1.3 million decline from Townhall Media and a 0.7 million decline from Eagle Financial Publications that was partially offset with a 0.2 million increase from Salem Web Network. Declines from Townhall Media were driven by changes in Facebook algorithms that limit political content, the growing use of browsers that block third-party cookies limiting advertising, and the overall state of the economy that has weakened demand for advertising resulting in a lower number of advertisements and a reduction in rates. Eagle Financial Publications experienced declines from economic conditions as the stock market impacts demand for advertisements on its platform. Salem Web Network benefitted from the addition of new product offerings, including Salem Cultivate, a donor acquisition digital resource designed to benefit our customers. Digital streaming revenue increased 4.1 , or 0.2 million, based on increased demand for content available from our Christian websites. There were no significant changes in rates. Digital subscription revenue increased 3.5 , or 0.4 million, including a 0.5 million increase from Townhall VIP and a 0.5 million increase from Salem Web Network that was offset with a 0.6 million decline from Eagle Financial Publications from a reduction in the number of new subscriptions generated and our sale in July 2021 of the Hilary Kramer newsletters. Digital download revenue increased 9.7 , or 0.6 million, due to a higher volume of downloads from our church product websites that reflect our July 2021 acquisition of ShiftWorship with no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year. Other revenue includes revenue sharing arrangements for mobile applications and mail list rentals, which declined slightly in volume with no changes in rates over the same period of the prior year.

Net book sales declined 27.5 , or 4.2 million, including a 3.8 million decline from Regnery Publishing from a 16 decline in volume and a 10 decline in the average price per unit sold, and a 0.4 million decline from Salem Author Services from a reduction in the number of books sold with no significant changes in sale prices. Book sales through Regnery Publishing are directly attributable to the number and popularity of titles released each period and the composite mix of titles available. Revenues vary significantly from period to period based on the book release date and the number and popularity of titles. The decline of 1.4 million in estimated sales returns and allowances reflects a lower number of print books sold through Regnery Publishing. Regnery Publishing e-book sales declined 32.8 , or 0.7 million, due to a 17 decrease in sales volume and a 19 decrease in the average price per unit sold. E-book sales can also vary based on the composite mix of titles released and available in each period. Revenues can vary significantly based on a book release date and the number of titles that achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book. Self-publishing fees increased 10.5 , or 0.6 million, due to an increase in the number of authors with no material change in fees charged to authors. There have been no sales of print magazine subscriptions and print advertising revenues following our sale of Singing News Magazine on May 25, 2021. Digital advertising was not significant to our Publishing revenue and is no longer sold. Other revenue includes change fees, video trailers and website revenues and subright revenue for foreign translation and audio books for original published titles from Regnery Publishing. Subright revenue remained consistent from the same period of the prior year. There were no changes in volume or rates. Broadcast Operating Expenses

The increase in expenses from Salem Surround, Salem News Channel, Salem Podcast Network, and SalemNOW are consistent with the growth and investment in these entities to expand digital product offerings and revenue sources in our broadcast division. The increase of 9.9 million from our broadcast stations includes a 4.5 million increase in payroll costs primarily driven by an increase in commissions and the January 2022 reinstatement of the company 401(k) match, a 1.3 million increase in advertising and event costs, a 1.2 million increase in travel and entertainment, a 1.1 million increase in bad debt expense, a 1.0 million increase in facility-related expenses, a 0.6 million increase in production and programming costs and a 0.5 million increase in professional services that were offset by a 0.2 million decrease in cost of sales. On a Same-Station basis, broadcast operating expenses increased 12.3 , or 17.9 million. The increase in broadcast operating expenses on a Same Station basis reflects these items net of the impact of start-up costs associated with acquisitions, station dispositions and format changes.

 In September 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement in connection with a lawsuit. While we denied the allegations made in the lawsuit, we believed that settling the matter was preferable to protracted and costly litigation. We previously estimated that we would resolve the matter for 0.5 million, and that amount was accrued at December 31, 2020. During mediation held in September 2022, the parties reached a settlement whereby we agreed to pay 5.3 million in exchange for a release by the plaintiff of all claims. The settlement amount was paid in December 2022. Digital Media Operating Expenses

 We completed our annual review for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result of declining revenue growth projections forecasted by industry analysts, we performed an interim review of broadcast licenses for impairment at September 30, 2022. Due to changes in macroeconomic conditions and rising interest rates that increased the weighted average cost of capital WACC ), we also performed an interim review of broadcast licenses for impairment at June 30, 2022. Based on our review and analysis, we recorded impairment charges of 14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. During our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of 2.3 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Columbus, Portland and San Francisco at December 31, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by declines in market revenue projections in excess of those used in our prior valuations. We recorded an impairment charge of 7.7 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Greenville, Honolulu, Little Rock, Orlando, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento, and San Francisco at September 30, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by a decline in projected revenues for the broadcast industry and a reduction in the future industry growth rates based on the then current economic indicators. We recorded an impairment charge of 3.9 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Columbus, Dallas, Greenville, Honolulu, Orlando, Portland, and Sacramento at June 30, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by an increase in the WACC partially offset with improvements in revenue growth rates over those used in prior year-end valuation forecasts. We believe that these factors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations. Impairment of Goodwill

As a result of changes in macroeconomic conditions and rising interest rates that increase the WACC, we performed an interim review of goodwill for impairment at June 30, 2022. Based on our review and analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of 0.1 million to goodwill in one of our broadcast markets at June 30, 2022. We completed our annual review for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2022 with no further impairment charges recognized.

Interest income represents earnings on excess cash and interest due under promissory notes. Interest expense includes interest due on outstanding debt balances and non-cash accretion associated with deferred installments. The decrease of 2.7 million reflects the lower outstanding balance of the 2024 Notes, the lower outstanding balance of the Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility ABL Facility ),, and a lower finance lease obligation outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2022. We received 11.2 million in aggregate principal amount of PPP loans through the SBA during the first quarter of 2021 based on the eligibility of our radio stations and networks as determined on a per-location basis. We used the PPP loan proceeds according to the applicable PPP requirements and filed timely applications for forgiveness. During July 2021, the SBA forgave all but 20,000 of the PPP loans resulting in a pre-tax gain on the forgiveness of 11.2 million. The gain on the early retirement of long-term debt reflects 21.1 million of repurchases of the 2024 Notes for 20.9 million in cash, recognizing a net gain of 48,000 after adjusting for bond issuance costs. The loss on the early retirement of long-term debt reflects 43.3 million of repurchases of the 2024 Notes for 44.0 million in cash, recognizing a net loss of 1.0 million after adjusting for bond issuance costs.

 We recognized a tax benefit of 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 0.8 million for the prior year. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes, or the effective tax rate, was 10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to (1.9) for the prior year. The effective tax rate for each period differs from the federal statutory income rate of 21.0 due to the effect of state income taxes, certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, and changes in the valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the primary drivers of the effective tax rate includes a federal income tax benefit generated from operations of 0.7 million, a reduction to the valuation allowance of 0.7 million relating to the utilization federal net operating loss carryforwards, a (1.5) million valuation allowance related to the generation of state net operating loss carryforwards, and current state income tax benefit of 0.1 million along with other permanent differences and other state statutory rate adjustments. The state income tax provision is an accumulation of applicable state income taxes calculated in accordance with each state s tax laws and each state s pre-tax income that ranges from various losses to income levels.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates require the use of judgment as to future events, and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties could materially impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, broadcast licenses, goodwill, and income taxes. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts to assist as considered necessary. 
 47 

Business and Asset Acquisitions We perform purchase price accounting upon an acquisition. The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Estimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. Acquisitions may include contingent earn-out consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts. We may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the acquisition date. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various asset categories in our financial statements. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that the purchase price allocations represent the appropriate estimated fair value of the assets acquired and we have not had to modify our purchase price allocations. We estimate the economic life of each tangible and intangible asset acquired to determine the period of time in which the asset should be depreciated or amortized. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the economic life of each asset. We consider our own experience with similar assets, industry trends, market conditions and the age of the property at the time of our acquisition to estimate the economic life of each asset. If the financial condition of the assets were to deteriorate, the resulting change in life or impairment of the asset could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. To date, we have not experienced changes in the economic life established for each major category of our assets. Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Approximately 65 of our total assets at December 31, 2022, consists of indefinite-lived intangible assets that originated from acquisitions in which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill. We do not amortize indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year. Impairment testing requires estimates of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as Level 3 inputs discussed in Note 12 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report. The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. These events and circumstances are not all-inclusive and are not by themselves indicators of impairment. We consider external and internal factors when reviewing the following events and circumstances, which are presented in the order of what we believe to be the strongest to weakest indicators of impairment: 

(1) 
 the difference between the latest fair value calculation and the carrying value; 
 48 

(2) 
 the financial performance, such as station operating income, as compared to projections used in prior estimates of fair value; 

(3) 
 macroeconomic economic conditions, including any limitations on accessing capital that could affect the discount rates used in prior estimates of fair value; 

(4) 
 industry and market considerations, such as declines in market-dependent multiples or metrics, changes in demand, competition, or other economic factors; 

(5) 
 operating cost factors, such as increases in labor costs, that could have a negative effect on future expected earnings and cash flows; 

(6) 
 legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; 

(7) 
 other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management or customers; and 

(8) 
 any changes to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, we perform a second step as required to prepare a quantitative analysis estimating the fair or enterprise value of the assets. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value as part of our quantitative review. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization to be meaningful when determining our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to, the limited trading volume of our stock and the significant voting control of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. If the results of our quantitative analysis indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. We believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. Sensitivity of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets When estimating the fair value of broadcast licenses and goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, operating cash flow margins and discount rates. These assumptions require substantial judgment that may differ materially from actual results. The following sensitivity analysis shows the incremental impact and the hypothetical non-cash impairment charge that would result if our estimates were to change by 100 basis points as of the annual testing period in the fourth quarter of 2022:

(1) 
 Each assumption used in the sensitivity analysis is independent of the other assumptions The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date. The same discount rate was used in 
 49 

each of our broadcast markets. The discount rate applied to our digital media and publishing entities was higher given the perceived additional risks associated with the cash flows of these businesses. Operating profit margin is defined as operating income before interest, depreciation, amortization, income tax, and corporate allocation charges divided by net revenue. For the fair value analysis, the projections of operating profit margin that are used are based upon industry expectations. These margin projections are not specific to the performance of our radio stations or segments in a market but are predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor. If actual future margins are lower than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. For the goodwill fair value analysis, the projections of operating margin for each broadcast market and each entity are based on our historical performance. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital, or publishing industry growth declines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. Long-term revenue growth rates are determined using publicly available information on industry expectations rather than our own estimates, which could differ. Long-term revenue growth rates can vary for each of our broadcast markets. Using industry expectations, each broadcast market, digital and publishing entity s revenue was forecasted over a ten-year projection period to reflect the projected long-term growth rate. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. Leases The most significant estimates used by management in accounting for leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows: Lease Term The lease term can materially impact the value of the Right-of-Use ROU assets and lease liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as required under FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases . We calculate the term for each lease agreement to include the noncancellable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the periods covered by options to extend the lease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) the periods covered by an option to terminate if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) the period covered by an option to extend (or not terminate) if controlled by the lessor. The assessment of whether we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant judgement surrounding contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors, and market-based factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology since adopting FASB ASC Topic 842. Incremental Borrowing Rate ROU assets and related lease liabilities recorded under FASB ASC Topic 842 are calculated based on the present value of the lease payments using (1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2) the lessee s Incremental Borrowing Rate IBR ). IBR is defined as the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we estimate the IBR applicable to Salem using significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, and the following available evidence: Our credit history . Our credit facilities consist of the 2028 Notes, the 2024 Notes, and the ABL revolver. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is calculated as of each month end. 
 50 

Our credit worthiness . We review our credit ratings from third parties, including Standard Poor s and Moody s. The class of the underlying asset and the remaining term of the arrangement . We use a portfolio approach applying a single IBR to all leases with reasonably similar characteristics, including the remaining lease term, the underlying assets, and the economic environment. We group leases according to the nature of leased asset and the lease term. We have six main categories of leases, (1) Buildings, (2) Equipment, (3) Land, (4) Other (Parking Facilities), (5) Towers and (6) Vehicles. We consider vehicles to have a higher risk for collateral that is mitigated by the shorter term of the lease that would typically range from three to five years. We consider building and towers to have a higher risk based on (1) the longer lease term of up to thirty years and (2) a higher outstanding balance that is mitigated by the lower risk that the collateralized asset would lose significant value. The debt incurred under the lease liability as compared to amounts that would be borrowed. We review the cost to finance comparable amounts under our ABL Facility and based on the current market environment as derived from available economic data. We referred to the Bloomberg Single B Rated Communications Yield Curve (unsecured) and considered adjustments for industry risk factors and the estimated value of the underlying leased asset to be collateral for the debt incurred. From these data points, we developed a matrix to estimate the IBR for each lease class. We review the IBR estimates on a quarterly basis and update as necessary. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not recognized significant changes in our estimates. Fair market value of leased asset : The fair market value of leased property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party sources. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease. A lease is considered a finance lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 of the fair market value of the leased property. A higher fair market value reduces the likelihood that a lease will be considered a finance lease. Impairment of ROU Assets ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present as described in Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report . Revenue Recognition Significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. We must assess the promises within each sales contract to determine if they are distinct performance obligations. Once the performance obligation(s) are determined, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation(s) based on a relative standalone selling price basis. If a sales contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not determinable, an estimate is used. Principal and Agent Considerations We generate revenue from digital product offerings, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated digital advertising solutions. When offering digital products, another party may be 
 51 

involved in providing the goods or services that make up a performance obligation to the customer, such as the use of third-party websites for social media campaigns. We must evaluate if we are the principal or agent in order to determine if revenue should be reported gross as principal or net as agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to our customer, we consider the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, who holds inventory risk, and who has discretion in establishing the price. The determination of whether we control a specified good or service immediately prior to the good or service being transferred requires us to make reasonable judgments on the nature of each agreement. We have determined that we are acting as principal when we manage all aspects of a social media campaign, including reviewing and approving target audiences, monitoring actual results, making modifications as needed, and when we are responsible for delivering campaign results to our customers regardless of the use of a third-party or parties. Sales Returns and Allowances We provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return, primarily book sales associated with Regnery Publishing. We record an estimate of product returns as a reduction of revenue in the period of the sale. Our estimates are based upon historical sales returns, the amount of current period sales, economic trends and any changes in customer demand and acceptance. We regularly monitor actual performance to estimated return rates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience. However, actual returns may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. Trade and Barter Transactions In broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash outlays by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate the balance reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis based on our historical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. Past due balances are generally not written off until all collection efforts have been unsuccessful, including use of a collection agency. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. 
 52 

Contingency Reserves In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration, and other claims that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, contained in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report. We record contingency reserves to the extent we conclude that it is probable that liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the subjective judgment of management. The reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. While we believe that the final resolution of any known matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is possible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that can result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report.. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of funds are operating cash flows, borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of selected assets or businesses. Historically, we have funded, and will continue to fund, expenditures for operations, administrative expenses, and capital expenditures from these sources. We have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings, including borrowings under credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, from operating cash flow and from proceeds on selected asset and business sales. We expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income-producing assets or proceeds from debt and equity offerings. To facilitate such offerings, in December 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to 15.0 million of our Class A Common Stock or up to 40.0 million of debt securities with B. Riley Securities, Inc. acting as sales agent. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we had adequate liquidity to meet our debt servicing requirements during 2020. As the economy began to show signs of recovery, we reversed several of these cost reduction initiatives during 2021, although we continued to operate with reduced staffing levels where appropriate, we have not declared or paid dividends or equity distributions on our common stock since December 2019, and the company 401(k) match was not reinstated until January 2022. The CARES Act provided emergency economic assistance for individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including opportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs. The CAA included a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of 
 53 

the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act and the CAA, including: 

We deferred 3.3 million of employer FICA taxes from April 2020 through December 2020, of which approximately 50 was paid in December 2021 and the remainder was paid in December 2022; 

A relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; 

We received Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans of 11.2 million in total during the first quarter of 2021 through the Small Business Association SBA based on the eligibility as determined on a per-location basis; and 

In July 2021, the SBA forgave all but 20,000 of the PPP loans, with the remaining PPP loan repaid in July 2021. Operating Cash Flows Our largest source of operating cash inflows are receipts from customers in exchange for advertising and programming. Other sources of operating cash inflows include receipts from customers for digital downloads and streaming, book sales, subscriptions, self-publishing fees, ticket sales, sponsorships, and vendor promotions. A majority of our operating cash outflows consist of payments to employees, such as salaries and benefits, vendor payments under facility and tower leases, talent agreements, inventory purchases and recurring services such as utilities and music license fees. Our operating cash flows are subject to factors such as fluctuations in preferred advertising media and changes in demand caused by shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, and audience tastes. In addition, our operating cash flows may be affected if our customers are unable to pay, delay payment of amounts owed to us, or if we experience reductions in revenue or increases in costs and expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, to 7.7 million from 22.5 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the following items: 

Total revenue increased by 8.7 million; 

Operating expenses exclusive of depreciation, amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, impairments, debt modification costs, legal settlement, and net gain (loss) on the disposition of assets, increased by 18.2 million; 

Accounts receivables, net of allowances, increased by 5.1 million compared to 1.2 million for the prior year; 

Unbilled revenue decreased 0.5 million; 

Our Day s Sales Outstanding, or the average number of days to collect cash from the date of sale, decreased to 54 days at December 31, 2022, from 56 days in the same period of the prior year; 

Deferred income tax liabilities decreased by 0.3 million compared to a decrease of 1.9 million during the same period of the prior year; and 

Net accounts payable and accrued expenses increased 6.6 million to 34.3 million from 27.7 million as of the prior year. Investing Cash Flows Our primary source of investing cash inflows includes proceeds from the sale of assets or businesses. Investing cash outflows include cash payments made to acquire businesses, to acquire property, equipment, and intangible assets, and to make investments that we believe are beneficial to our business. 
 54 

We undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and/or FCC broadcast licenses, expand our digital and web-based offerings, improve our facilities, and upgrade our computer infrastructures. The nature and timing of these upgrades and expenditures can be delayed or scaled back at the discretion of management. Based on our current plans, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately 11.1 million during 2023. We invested in OPA, an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. We received a return of our total investment of 4.5 million of cash from OPA during 2022 that is reflected as an investing cash inflow. All other receipts from OPA represent our share of revenue from the documentary motion picture and are included in operating cash flow. While our focus continues to be on deleveraging the company, we remain committed to the exploration and pursuit of strategic acquisitions and investments. We plan to fund any future investing outflows from cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income-producing assets or proceeds from debt and equity offerings. Net cash used in investing activities was 0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by of 11.6 million during the prior year. The 12.5 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was the result of: 

Cash paid for capital expenditures increased 2.5 million to 13.3 million from 10.8 million during the prior year; 

Cash paid for acquisitions decreased 3.1 million to 2.2 million compared to 5.3 million during the prior year; 

Cash received from return of investments was 4.5 million in the current year; 

Cash paid for investments increased 2.5 million to 3.5 million from 1.0 million; and 

Cash received from the sale of assets decreased 15.1 million to 14.2 million from 29.3 million. Financing Cash Flows Financing cash inflows include borrowings under our credit facilities and any proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock incentive plan. Financing cash outflows include repayments of our credit facilities, the payment of equity distributions and payments of amounts due under deferred installments, and contingency earn-out consideration associated with acquisition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the principal balances outstanding under the 2024 Notes, the 2028 Notes and the ABL Facility ranged from 158.9 million to 174.5 million. These outstanding balances were ordinary and customary based on our operating and investing cash needs during this time. Our sole source of cash available for making any future equity distributions is our operating cash flow, subject to our credit facilities and Notes, which contain covenants that limit and restrict the payment of dividends and equity distributions unless certain specified conditions are satisfied. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, decreased 30.0 million to 8.6 million compared to 38.6 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities includes: 

Proceeds of 114.7 million were received during the prior year from the issuance of the 2028 Notes; 

Proceeds of 11.2 million under PPP loans were received during the prior year; 

We used 20.9 million in cash to repurchase 21.1 million in face value of the 2024 Notes compared to 44.0 million in cash to repurchase 43.3 million in face value of 2024 Notes during the prior year; 
 55 

Net borrowings on our ABL Facility were 9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net repayments of 5.0 million during the same period of the prior year; and:

 As of December 31, 2022, the ABL, had a borrowing base of 26.2 million, 9.1 million in outstanding borrowings, and 0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a 16.8 million borrowing base availability. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.99 and 6.85 at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022, respectively. In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest obligations related to our long-term debt as follows as of December 31, 2022: 

114.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of 7.125 ; 

39.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of 6.75 ; and 

Commitment fee of 0.25 to 0.375 per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. 2028 Notes On September 10, 2021, we refinanced 112.8 million of the 2024 Notes for 114.7 million (reflecting a call premium of 1.688 of newly issued 2028 Notes. Contemporaneously with the refinancing, we obtained commitments from the holders of the 2028 Notes to purchase up to 50 million in additional 2028 Notes Delayed Draw 2028 Notes ), contingent upon satisfying certain performance benchmarks, the proceeds of which are to be used exclusively to repurchase or repay the remaining balance outstanding of the 2024 Notes. We used the cash proceeds from 2028 Notes to fund the repurchase of a portion of our 2024 Notes. The 2028 Notes and the related guarantees were sold to certain holders of the 2024 Notes, whom we believe to be qualified 
 56 

institutional buyers, in a private placement. The 2028 Notes and the related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The transaction was assessed on a lender-specific level and was accounted for as a debt modification in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470. The 2028 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis. We may redeem the 2028 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2024, at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or after June 1, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the 2028 Notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including the redemption date. In addition, we may redeem up to 35 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes before June 1, 2024, with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.125 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including the redemption date. We may also redeem up to 10 of the aggregate original principal amount of the 2028 Notes per twelve-month period, in connection with up to two redemptions in such twelve-month period, at a redemption price of 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. The 2028 Notes mature on June 1, 2028, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest accrues on the 2028 Notes from September 10, 2021, and is payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2021. Based on the balance of the 2028 Notes outstanding at December 31, 2022, we are required to pay 8.2 million per year in interest. As of December 31, 2022, accrued and unpaid interest on the 2028 Notes was 0.7 million. The indenture to the 2028 Notes contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain specified exceptions, limit the ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments; (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or transfer assets. At December 31, 2022, we were, and as of the date of this annual report we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture. We recorded debt issuance costs of 4.7 million, of which third-party costs of 2.5 million were expensed during 2021 and 0.3 million were expensed during 2022, 0.8 million was deferred with the Delayed Draw 2028 Notes, and 1.1 million, along with 3.0 million from the exchanged 2024 Notes, is being amortized as part of the effective yield on the 2028 Notes. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 0.7 million and 0.3 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs, discount and delayed draw associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense. SBA PPP Loans We received 11.2 million in aggregate principal amount of PPP loans through the SBA during the first quarter of 2021 based on the eligibility of our radio stations and networks as determined on a per-location basis. The PPP loans were accounted for as debt in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470. The loan balances and accrued interest were forgivable provided that the proceeds were used for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent, and utilities within the covered period. We used the PPP loan proceeds according to applicable PPP requirements and filed timely applications for forgiveness. During July 2021, the SBA forgave all but 20,000 of the PPP loans resulting in a pre-tax gain on the forgiveness of 11.2 million. The remaining 20,000 PPP loan was repaid by us in July 2021.

2024 Notes On May 19, 2017, we issued 2024 Notes in a private placement. The 2024 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries Subsidiary Guarantors ). The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75 per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest is payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 2024 Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral as described below. There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation other than the economic value and proceeds thereof. The indenture relating to the 2024 Notes contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain specified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments; (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or transfer assets. At December 31, 2022, we were, and as of the date of this annual report, we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture. We recorded debt issuance costs of 6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the debt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes using the effective interest method. During twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, 0.2 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense. Based on the balance of the 2024 Notes outstanding at December 31, 2022 of 39.0 million, we are required to pay 2.6 million per year in interest on the 2024 Notes. As of December 31, 2022, accrued and unpaid interest on the 2024 Notes was 0.3 million. We may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity, and other factors, seek to repurchase the 2024 Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions warrant. As described above under the caption 2028 Notes, on September 10, 2021, we exchanged 112.8 million of the 2024 Notes for 114.7 million of newly issued 2028 Notes, reflecting a call premium of 1.688 . Bond issuance costs of 1.1 million associated with the 112.8 million of the 2024 Notes are being amortized as part of the effective yield on the 2028 Notes.

Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility On May 19, 2017, we entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement Credit Agreement by and among us and our subsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the 2024 Notes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The ABL Facility is 30.0 million revolving credit facility due March 1, 2024, which includes a 5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a 7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50 to 1.00 for base rate borrowings and 1.50 to 2.00 for 
 59 

LIBOR borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00 per annum. Amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25 to 0.375 per year based on the level of borrowings. An April 7, 2020 amendment to the ABL Facility allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR scheduled to be discontinued. Availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90 of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. As of December 31, 2022, the amount available under the ABL Facility was 26.2 million of which 9.0 million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the Subsidiary Guarantors accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets, and by a second-priority lien on the notes priority collateral. There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation other than the economic value and proceeds thereof. The Credit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of 15 of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and 4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold amount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) make investments; (iii) make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) sell assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) prepay indebtedness (which does not include bond repurchases); and (ix) pay dividends. The Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) non-payment of any principal or letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees, or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or any other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made; (iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least 10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money of 10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. At December 31, 2022, we were, and as of the date of this annual report we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under Credit Agreement. We recorded debt issue costs of 0.9 million that were recorded as an asset and are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, 0.1 million of debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2022, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 6.73 . We report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and customary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Impairment Losses on Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We have incurred impairment losses associated with goodwill and indefinite lived assets. The valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. The fair value measurements for our indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective market clusters and reporting units. While the impairment charges we have recognized are non-cash in nature and have not violated any debt covenants, the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows. We believe that we have adequately considered the potential for an economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non-cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 

Salem Media Group, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Salem Media Group, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Broadcast License Impairment 

As disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated broadcast license balance was 304 million as of December 31, 2022. Management performs an annual impairment test during the 

63 

Table of Contents 
 fourth 

 quarter of each year, which includes a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a broadcast license is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the market conditions, events and circumstances that

may affect the estimated fair value of broadcast licenses. If there are changes in market conditions, events, or other circumstances that occur during the interim periods that indicate the carrying value of its broadcast licenses may be impaired, management determines whether an interim test is necessary. Broadcast licenses are assessed for recoverability at the market cluster level. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a market cluster s broadcast licenses to the carrying value. Fair value is estimated by management using the Greenfield method, which is a form of the income approach, assuming a hypothetical 
 start-up
 
scenario in which the only asset held by the station as of the valuation date is the broadcasting license. Management s cash flow projections for its broadcast licenses included significant judgments and assumptions relating to the market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type, the forecasted growth rate of each radio market (including long-term growth rate), and the risk-adjusted discount rate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded approximately 14 million of impairment charges for broadcast licenses.

 We considered auditing broadcast license impairment to be a critical audit matter because it involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management s estimates, judgments and assumptions, significant audit effort due to complexity in the aggregation and evaluation of significant amounts of data, and the use of valuation specialists when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

Evaluating the Company s process used to develop accounting estimates to test broadcast license impairment;

Evaluating management s judgments in their assessment of identifying changes in market conditions, events or other circumstances that indicate an impairment of broadcast licenses may be present;

Testing the completeness, accuracy, appropriateness of aggregation and relevance of underlying data used in the valuation model based on Greenfield method;

Evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management, which are normalized market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type, the forecasted growth rate of each radio market (including long-term growth rate), and the risk-adjusted discount rate and market share. This involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance in the market being evaluated, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Utilizing valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of methods used, evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions applied in the valuation model, and recalculations of the discounted cash flow schedules.

 Rental income is not applicable to FASB ASC Topic 606, but shown for the purpose of identifying each revenue source presented in total revenue on our Consolidated Financial Statements within this annual report. 

A summary of each of our revenue streams is as follows: 

 Block Programming

.

 We recognize revenue from the sale of airtime to program producers in blocks that typically range from 12 1
/ 2
, 25 or 50-minutes
 of time. We separate block programming revenue into 
 categories, National, Local, and Infomercial revenue. Our stations are classified by format, including Christian Teaching and Talk, News Talk, and Contemporary Christian Music. National and local programming content is complementary to our station format while infomercials are closely associated with long-form advertisements. Block Programming revenue may include variable consideration for charities and programmers that purchase blocks of airtime to generate donations and contributions from our audience. Block programming revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Programming revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an

to , with a money-back guarantee for the first 30 days. Refunds after the first 30-day
 period are considered on a pro-rata
 basis based on the number of publications issued and delivered. Payments are due in advance of delivery and can be made in full upon subscribing or in quarterly installments. Cash received in advance of the subscription term, including amounts that are refundable, is recorded in contract labilities. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term at the point in time that each publication is transmitted or shipped, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is reported net of estimated cancellations, which are based on our experience and historical cancellation rates during the cancellable period. 
 Book Sales

. We recognize revenue from the sale of books upon shipment, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded at the gross amount due from the customer, net of estimated sales returns and allowances based on our historical experience. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of the revenue in the current period. Print-based consumer books are sold on a fully returnable basis. We do not record assets or inventory for the value of returned books as they are considered used regardless of the condition returned. Our experience with unsold or returned books is that their resale value is insignificant, and they are often destroyed or disposed of. 
 Self-Publishing Fees

. We recognize revenue from self-publishing services through Salem Author Services SAS ), including book publishing and support services to independent authors. Services include book cover design, interior layout, printing, distribution, marketing services and editing for print books and eBooks. As each book and related support services are unique to each author, authors must make payments in advance of the performance. Payments are typically made in installments over the expected production timeline for each publication. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received, including those amounts that are fully or partially refundable. Contract liabilities were historically recorded under the caption deferred revenue and are reported as current liabilities or long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements based on the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms of the contract. Refunds are limited based on the percentage completion of each publishing project. 
 Revenue is recognized upon completion of each performance obligation, which represents the point in time that control of the product is transferred to the author, thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is recorded at the net amount due from the author, including discounts based on the service package. 

 Other Revenue

.

 Other revenue includes various sources, such as event revenue, listener purchase programs, talent fees for on-air
 hosts, rental income for studios and towers, production services, and shipping and handling fees. We recognize event revenue, including fees earned for ticket sales and sponsorships, when the event occurs, 

million. 
 Contract Liabilities 

Contract liabilities consist of customer advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. We may receive payments from our customers in advance of completing our performance obligations. Additionally, new customers, existing customers without approved credit terms and authors purchasing specific self-publishing services, are required to make payments in advance of the delivery of the products or performance of the services. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received in excess of revenue recognized, including payments that are refundable if the customer cancels the contract according to the contract terms. Contract liabilities were historically recorded under the caption deferred revenue and are reported as current liabilities on our consolidated financial statements when the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms of our contracts is less than one year. Long-term contract liabilities represent the amount of payments received in excess of revenue earned, including those that are refundable, when the time to fulfill the performance obligation is greater than one year. Our long-term liabilities consist of subscriptions with a term of two years for which some customers have purchased and paid for multiple years.

Significant Financing Component

The length of our typical sales agreement is less than 12 months; however, we may sell subscriptions with a two-year
 term. The balance of our long-term contract liabilities represents the unsatisfied performance obligations for subscriptions with a remaining term in excess of one year. We review long-term contract liabilities that are expected to be completed in excess of one year to assess whether the contract contains a significant financing component. The balance includes subscriptions that will be satisfied at various dates between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2027. The difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the publications is not significant. Therefore, we have concluded that subscriptions do not contain a significant financing component under FASB ASC Topic 606. 
 Our self-publishing contracts may exceed a one-year
 term due to the length of time for an author to submit and approve a manuscript for publication. The author may pay for publishing services in installments over the production timeline with payments due in advance of performance. The timing of the transfer of goods and services under self-publishing arrangements are at the discretion of the author and based on future events that are not substantially within our control. We require advance payments to provide us with protection from incurring costs for products that are unique and only sellable to the author. Based on these considerations, we have concluded that our self-publishing contracts do not contain a significant financing component under FASB ASC Topic 606. 
 Variable Consideration 

We make significant estimates related to variable consideration at the point of sale, including estimates for refunds and product returns. Under FASB ASC Topic 606, estimates of variable consideration are to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances, including when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of any estimated cumulative revenue will not occur. 

 We enter into agreements under which the amount of revenue we earn is contingent upon the amount of money raised by our customer over the contract term. Our customer is typically a charity or programmer that purchases blocks of programming time or spots to generate revenue from our audience members. Contract terms can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the charity or programmer. If the campaign does not generate a pre-determined
 level of donations or revenue to our customer, the consideration that we expect to be entitled to may vary above a minimum base level per the contract. Historically, under FASB ASC Topic 605, we reported variable consideration as revenue when the amount was fixed and determinable. Under FASB ASC Topic 606, variable consideration is to be estimated using the expected value or the most likely amount to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. 

 Based on the constraints for using estimates of variable consideration within FASB ASC Topic 606, and our historical experience with these campaigns, we will continue to recognize revenue at the base amount of the

Depreciation expense was approximately 
 million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We periodically review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. This review requires us to estimate the fair value of the assets using significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates we used, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. There were no indications of impairment during the period ended December 31, 2022.

Our lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We lease certain properties from our principal stockholders or from trusts and partnerships created for the benefit of our principal stockholders and their families. These leases are designated as Related Party leases in the details provided. We are obligated to pay taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance charges under a majority of our lease agreements.
 
 Operating leases are reflected on our balance sheet within operating lease ROU assets and the related current and non-current
 operating lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from lease agreement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date, or the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use, based upon the present value of the lease payments over the respective lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, subject to any changes in the lease or expectation regarding the lease terms. Variable lease costs, such as common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance, are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of ROU Assets 

ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment

, as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial assets. 
 ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. 

After a careful analysis of the guidance, we concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing ROU assets for impairment is the broadcast market cluster level for radio station operations and the entity or division level for digital media entities, publishing entities and networks. Corporate ROU assets are tested on a consolidated level with consideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity. 

FASB ASC Topic 360 requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure the impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used: 

Step 1 Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present 

The following are examples of impairment indicators: 

A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group) 

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition. 

for a nominal fee that is expensed as incurred. We continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are necessary for the FCC renewal and all of our broadcast licenses have been renewed. We expect all of our broadcast licenses to be renewed in the future and therefore, we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets. We are not aware of any legal, competitive, economic, or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our broadcast licenses. The weighted-average period before the next renewal of our broadcasting licenses is years.

Broadcast Licenses Impairment Test 

We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year. The unit of accounting we use to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment, and managed by a single general manager. The cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results. 

 During our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses exceeded the carrying value and no impairment was recorded. We continued to monitor the critical accounting estimates used in our valuations and determined that interim impairment testing was appropriate during the second and third quarters of 2022. Our annual testing was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 with updates to our interim assumptions based on the latest forecasts of economic and market conditions. 

 The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that a broadcast license is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses. We review the significant assumptions and key estimates applicable to our latest estimated fair value calculations to assess if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect these assumptions and key estimates. We also review internal benchmarks and the economic performance for each market cluster to assess if it is more likely than not that impairment exists. 

 As part of our qualitative assessment, we calculate the excess fair value, or the amount by which our latest estimated fair value exceeds the current period carrying value. Based on our analysis and review, including the financial performance of each market, we believe that a excess fair value margin is a reasonable benchmark for our qualitative analysis. Markets with an excess fair value of 25 or more, which have had no significant changes in the prior valuation assumptions and key estimates, are not likely to be impaired. Markets with an excess fair value that is less than 25 are subject to further testing. 

Broadcast license carrying value (in thousands)

The second part of our qualitative assessment consists of a review of the financial operating results for each market cluster. Radio stations are often sold on the basis of a multiple of projected cash flow, or Station Operating Income SOI defined as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses, a non-GAAP

Broadcast license carrying value (in thousands)

We engaged Bond Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us with determining the enterprise value of 25 of our market clusters. The estimated fair value of each market cluster was determined using the Greenfield Method, a form of the income approach. The premise of the Greenfield Method is that the value of a broadcast license is equivalent to a hypothetical start-up
 in which the only asset owned by the station as of the valuation date is the broadcast license. This approach eliminates factors that are unique to our operation of the station, including its format and historical financial performance. The method then assumes the entity has to purchase, build, or rent all of the other assets needed to operate a comparable station to the one in which the broadcast license is being utilized as of the valuation date. Cash flows are estimated and netted against all start-up
 costs, expenses, and investments necessary to achieve a normalized and mature state of operations, thus reflecting only the cash flows directly attributable to the broadcast license. A multi-year discounted cash flow approach is then used to determine the net present value of these cash flows to derive an indication of fair value. For cash flows beyond the projection period, a terminal value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth model and long-term industry growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and Gross Domestic Product GDP inflation rates.

million during the year ended December 31, 2022. During our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment charge 
of million to the value of broadcast licenses in Columbus, Portland and San Francisco at December 31, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by declines in market revenue projections in excess of those used in our prior valuations. We recorded an impairment charge of 
 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Greenville, Honolulu, Little Rock, Orlando, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento, and San Francisco at September 30, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by a decline in market revenues projections and a reduction in the future industry growth rates based on the then current economic indicators. We recorded an impairment charge 
of million to the value of broadcast licenses in Columbus, Dallas, Greenville, Honolulu, Orlando, Portland, and Sacramento at June 30, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by an increase in the WACC partially offset with improvements in revenue growth rates over those used in prior year-end
 valuation forecasts. We believe that these factors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations.

Goodwill Impairment Testing 

When performing our annual impairment testing for goodwill, the fair value of each applicable accounting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which is a form of the income approach. The discounted cash flow analysis utilizes a five to ten-year
 projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view. We make certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data, historical performance, and our expectations of future performance. We also make assumptions regarding working capital requirements and ongoing capital expenditures for fixed assets. Future net free cash flows are calculated on a debt free basis and discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. The terminal year value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth method and long-term growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and GDP inflation rates. The resulting fair value estimates, net of any interest-bearing debt, are then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit s net assets. 
 During our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that no impairment charges were necessary to the carrying value of goodwill. We continued to monitor the critical accounting estimates used in our valuations and determined that interim impairment testing was appropriate for the second and third quarters of 2022. Our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflected updates to our interim assumptions based on current economic and market conditions. 

The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets, including goodwill, are less than their carrying values. We review the significant inputs used in our prior year fair value estimates to determine if any changes to those inputs should be made. We estimate the fair value using a market approach and compare the estimated fair value of each entity to its carrying value, including goodwill. Under the market approach, we apply a multiple of four to each entities operating income to estimate the fair value. We believe that a multiple of four is a reasonable indicator of fair value as described in Note 8, Broadcast Licenses.

If the results of our qualitative assessment indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value, we perform a second quantitative review of the reporting unit. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value as part of this quantitative review.

 Based on our review and analysis, we determined that no impairment charges were necessary to the carrying value of our broadcast market goodwill as of the annual testing period ended December 31, 2022. We recorded an impairment charge of million to goodwill in one of our broadcast markets at June 30, 2022. The impairment charge was driven by an increase in the WACC partially offset by improvements in revenue growth rates over those used in the prior year-end
 valuation forecasts. There were no impairments during the annual testing period ended December 31, 2021.

Goodwill Digital Media 

The unit of accounting we use to test goodwill in our digital media segment is the entity level, which includes SWN, Townhall.com 
, and Eagle Financial Publications. The financial statements for SWN include the operating results and cash flows for our Christian content websites and our church product websites. The financial statements for Townhall.com 
 reflect the operating results for each of our conservative opinion websites. Eagle Financial Publications include our investing websites and related digital publications. The entity level is the level reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available.

Goodwill Publishing 

The unit of accounting we use to test goodwill in our publishing segment is the entity level for Regnery 
 Publishing and Salem Author Services. Regnery 
 Publishing is a book publisher based in Washington DC that operates from a stand-alone facility under one general manager, with operating results and cash flow reported at the entity level. Salem Author Services operates a self-publishing business from a stand-alone facility in Orlando, Florida under one general manager who is responsible for the operating results and cash flow. The entity level is the level reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available. 

 Each of these publishing entities have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2022. We tested one entity based on the length of time elapsed from the last valuation and the other entity based on the amount by which the latest estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value. We also tested one entity during interim testing at June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022. We engaged Bond Pecaro, 
an independent appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us in estimating the enterprise of value this publishing entity to test goodwill for impairment. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up.

2028 Notes 

On September 10, 2021, we refinanced million of the 2024 Notes for million (reflecting a call premium of of newly issued Senior Secured Notes due 2028 2028 Notes ). Contemporaneously with the refinancing, we obtained commitments from the holders of the 2028 Notes to purchase up to million in additional 2028 Notes Delayed Draw 2028 Notes ), contingent upon satisfying certain performance benchmarks, the proceeds of which are to be used exclusively to repurchase or repay the remaining balance outstanding of the 2024 Notes. 

 We used the cash proceeds from 2028 Notes to fund the repurchase of a portion of our 2024 Notes. The 2028 Notes and the related guarantees were sold to certain holders of the 2024 Notes, whom we believe to be qualified institutional buyers, in a private placement. The 2028 Notes and the related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The transaction was assessed on a lender-specific level and was accounted for as a debt modification in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470. 

 The 2028 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis. We may redeem the 2028 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2024, at a price equal to of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or after June 1, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the 2028 Notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including the redemption date. In addition, we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes before June 1, 2024, with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including the redemption date. We may also redeem up to of the aggregate original principal amount of the 2028 Notes per twelve-month period, in connection with up to two redemptions in such twelve-month period, at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. 

 The 2028 Notes mature on , unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. . 
 Based on the balance of the 2028 Notes outstanding at December 31, 2022, we are required to pay 

million per year in interest. As of December 31, 2022, accrued and unpaid interest on the 2028 Notes was

 million. 

million, of which third-party costs of million were expensed during 2021 and million were expensed during 2022, million was deferred with the Delayed Draw 2028 Notes, and million, along with million from the exchanged 2024 Notes, is being amortized as part of

We received million in aggregate principal amount of PPP loans through the SBA during the first quarter of 2021 based on the eligibility of our radio stations and networks as determined on a per-location
 basis. The PPP loans were accounted for as debt in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470. The loan balances and accrued interest were forgivable provided that the proceeds were used for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent, and utilities within the covered period. We used the PPP loan proceeds according to applicable PPP requirements

 and filed timely applications for forgiveness. During July 2021, the SBA forgave all but of the PPP loans resulting in a pre-tax
 gain on the forgiveness of million. The remaining 

 PPP loan was repaid by us 

 in . 
 2024 Notes 

On May 19, 2017, we issued 6.75 Senior Secured Notes 2024 Notes in a private placement. The 2024 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries Subsidiary Guarantors ). The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest is payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year. 

 The 2024 Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral as described below. There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation other than the economic value and proceeds thereof. 

 At December 31, 2022, we were, and 
 as of the date of this annual report

 we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture. 

 We recorded debt issuance costs of million that were recorded as a reduction of the debt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash
 interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, million and million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense. 
 Based on the balance of the 2024 Notes outstanding 
 at December 31, 2022, 

 of million, we are required to pay million per year in interest on the 2024 Notes. As of December 31, 2022, accrued 
 and unpaid 

 interest on the 2024 Notes was million.

We may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity, and other factors, seek to repurchase the 2024 Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions warrant. As described above under

As of December 31, 2022, the amount available under the ABL Facility was million of which million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the Subsidiary Guarantors accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets, and by a second-priority lien on the notes priority collateral.

The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) make investments; (iii) make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) sell assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) prepay indebtedness (which does not include bond repurchases); and (ix) pay dividends.

 If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral.

e recorded debt issue costs of million that were recorded as an asset and are being amortized to non-cash
 interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, million of debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2022, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was . 
 We report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and customary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.

At December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in years through and for state income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in years 2023 through 2042. As a result of our adjusted cumulative three-year pre-tax
 book loss as of December 31, 2020, we performed an assessment of positive and negative evidence with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The economic uncertainty from the COVID-19
 pandemic provided additional negative evidence that outweighed positive evidence which resulted in recognition of a million valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to the federal and state net operating loss carry forwards. During 2022, through operational activity of the company and non-recurring
 items such as land sales, we utilized and generated net operating loss carryforwards and adjusted the related valuation allowance by million bringing the total valuation allowance to million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The amortization of our indefinite-lived intangible assets for tax purposes, but not for book purposes, creates deferred tax liabilities. A reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite-lived intangibles: (1) become impaired; or (2) are sold, which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction. Due to the amortization for tax purposes and not for book purposes of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we expect to continue to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods exclusive of any impairment losses in future periods. These deferred tax liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards result in differences between our provision for income tax and cash paid for taxes.

Stock Option and Restricted Stock Grants 

Eligible employees may receive stock option awards annually with the number of shares and type of instrument generally determined by the employee s salary grade and performance level. Incentive and non-qualified
 stock option awards allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a set price, not to be less than the closing market price on the date of award, for no consideration payable by the recipient. The related number of shares underlying the stock option is fixed at the time of the grant. Options generally vest over a period with a maximum term of from the vesting date. In addition, certain management and professional level employees may receive stock option awards upon the commencement of employment. 
 The Plan also allows for awards of restricted stock that contain transfer restrictions under which they cannot be sold, pledged, transferred, or assigned until the period specified in the award, generally from one to . Restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are granted at no cost to the recipient other than applicable taxes owed by the recipient. The awards are considered issued and outstanding from the date of grant. 

 The fair value of each award is estimated as of the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility reflects the consideration of the historical volatility of our common stock as determined by the closing price over a six to 
 term commensurate with the expected term of the award. Expected dividends reflect the amount of quarterly distributions authorized and declared on our Class A and Class B common stock as of the grant date. The expected term of the awards is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the award are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have used historical data to estimate future forfeiture rates to apply against the gross amount of compensation expense determined using the valuation model. These estimates have approximated our actual forfeiture rates.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

(a) 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)). Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this annual report. 

(b) 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 

(2) 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of managements and directors of the Company; and 

(3) 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
 124 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the framework set forth in the 2013 report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. 

(c) 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 14 
 Financial Code of Conduct Salem Media Group, Inc.
(the Company has always held itself and its directors and employees to the highest standards of ethical behavior in all business dealings. These standards include an expectation that the integrity of the Company s financial
reporting will never be compromised. All Salem employees and directors have a primary responsibility to ensure that all Company transactions are properly accounted for in the Company s accounting records and reflected on the Company s
public reports. It is appropriate to adopt a code of conduct uniquely applicable to financial matters and which supplements the Code of Ethics to which
all employees of the Company are subject. Specifically, each person subject to this Code of Conduct will at all times: 

1. 
 If working on financial documents and matters, ensure that external and internal financial data, and other
information contained in the Company s public reports (a) present the facts in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) fairly and completely, and (b) accurately, timely and understandably set
forth the facts they purport to represent. 

2. 
 Uphold honest and ethical conduct, especially in relation to the handling of actual and apparent conflicts of
interest. 

3. 
 Report any conflicts of interest or any violation or suspected violation of this code of ethics as described
below. 

4. 
 Ensure the Company is in full compliance with the law, all applicable rules and regulations, and Company
policy, both in letter and in spirit. 

5. 
 Refrain from using the Company s confidential information, Company resources or corporate opportunities
learned in the course of one s work for personal advantage without prior written approval from their supervisor. Any person who
violates this Code of Conduct is subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. The same is true of people who know of but fail to report another employee or director s violation of law or Company policy. 
 Any person who has reason to believe or suspect that this Ethical Code has been violated should immediately report the basis for such belief or suspicion to
the Company. The report can be made through the Company s Ethics Helpline either telephonically (at 866-224-2163) or via the Internet
(at www.SalemEthics.com ). Reports to the Company s Ethics Helpline may be left anonymously, but the more information provided the greater ability the Company will have to investigate.
