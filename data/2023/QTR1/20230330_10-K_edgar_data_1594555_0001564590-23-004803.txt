 Huntingdon Valley Bank 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a stock savings bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the "Pennsylvania Department of Banking"). We have offices in Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania and Mount Laurel, New Jersey and Wilmington, Delaware. We are a community-oriented bank offering a variety of financial products and services to meet the needs of our customers. We believe that our community orientation and personalized service distinguishes us from larger banks that operate in our market area. 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank was founded in 1871 as a building and loan association. In 1951, the association converted to a federal thrift charter, changed its name to Huntingdon Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association and became federally insured. In January 2000, we changed our corporate name to Huntingdon Valley Bank. On July 1, 2003, Huntingdon Valley Bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a Pennsylvania chartered mutual savings bank. 
 Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans) and other commercial business, construction loans and, to a lesser extent, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit HELOCs and consumer loans. Additionally, we originated loans as participants in the Paycheck Protection Program PPP as well as the Main Street Lending Program in 2020. 
 We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and principal and interest payments on loans and securities. 
 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank formed a digital banking division called Braavo Bank in 2021. Braavo Bank s digital loan origination, deposit account opening, and treasury management tools enable ecommerce businesses to grow their businesses and manage their cash flow in an all-digital manner. Its proprietary underwriting model extracts inventory sales data from the customers Amazon accounts to determine appropriate credit lines and inventory advance rates. A variation of the software has been adapted to finance small-dollar consumer loans and

Competition 
 We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money centers and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Banks owned by large bank holding companies such as PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Wells Fargo & Company, TD Bank, Santander and Citizens Financial Group, Inc. also operate in our market area.

We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. 
 Lending Activities 
 General. Our principal lending activity is the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, construction loans and, to a lesser extent, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. Our primary business has been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, of which 32.3 were adjustable-rate loans and 67.7 were fixed-rate loans as of December 31, 2022 and the sale of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We currently sell in the secondary market most of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, primarily jumbo loans, in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending . At December 31, 2022, we had 155.0 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 32.8 of our total loan portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2022 we had 15.2 million of residential mortgages held for sale. We originate fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans as well as adjustable-rate loans depending on market conditions and borrower preferences. At December 31, 2022, 67.7 of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 32.3 of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. 
 Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines when the loan balance meets such guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits, which as of December 31, 2022 was generally 647,200 for single-family homes in our market area. We typically sell most of our fixed-rate conforming loans on a servicing-released basis. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as jumbo loans, that we retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 15 to 30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80 . At December 31, 2022, we had 51.1 million in jumbo loans, which represented 33.0 of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Of the 51.1 million in jumbo loans, 58.1 or 29.7 million were variable jumbo loans and 41.9 or 21.4 million, were fixed jumbo loans. Our average loan size for jumbo loans was 968,000 at December 31, 2022. We also offer FHA, USDA and VA loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, USDA and VA guidelines. Most of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area. 
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80 of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 95 . 
 Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a margin above the Treasury rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 5 for the first adjustment period and 2 per adjustment period thereafter, with a lifetime interest rate cap of generally 5 over the initial interest rate of the loan. We typically hold in portfolio our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for up to seven years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in market interest rates generally may be limited. 
 We offer on a limited basis one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties. We require personal guarantees from the borrowers on these properties, and we will not make loans in excess of 85 loan-to-value on non-owner-occupied properties. 
 We may offer interest only mortgage loans on construction to permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also have not offered and will not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We have not had a subprime lending program for one- to four-family residential real estate loans i.e. , loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt- 

6 

burden ratios), or Alt-A loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with better credit scores who borrow with alternative documentation such as little or no verification of income). 
 We require title insurance on all of our one- to four-family residential real estate mortgage loans, and we also require that borrowers maintain fire and extended coverage casualty insurance (and, if appropriate, flood insurance) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the replacement cost of the improvements. Substantially all of our residential real estate mortgage loans have a mortgage escrow account from which disbursements are made for real estate taxes and flood insurance. We do not conduct environmental testing on residential real estate mortgage loans unless specific concerns for hazards are identified by the appraiser used in connection with the origination of the loan. If we identify an environmental problem on land that will secure a loan, the environmental hazard must be remediated before the closing of the loan. 
 When underwriting residential real estate loans, we review and verify each loan applicant s employment, income and credit history and, if applicable, our experience with the borrower. Our policy is to obtain credit reports and financial statements on all borrowers and guarantors, and to verify references. Properties securing real estate loans are appraised by board-approved independent appraisers. Appraisals are subsequently reviewed by our loan underwriting department. 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We also offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by either first mortgages or second mortgages on owner occupied one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2022, outstanding home equity loans and equity lines of credit totaled 2.3 million, or 0.5 of total loans outstanding. At December 31, 2022, the unadvanced portion of home equity lines of credit totaled 7.7 million. At December 31, 2022, 1.5 million of our home equity loans and lines of credit were in a junior lien position. 
 The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a title review, the recordation of a lien, a determination of the applicant s ability to satisfy existing debt obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and our lines of credit is generally limited to 80 when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and with terms up to 20 years. Our home equity lines of credit generally have 30-year terms and adjustable-rates of interest, subject to a contractual floor, which are indexed to the prime rate. 
 Commercial Real Estate Lending . We also offer commercial real estate loans, including a limited amount of multi-family loans. At December 31, 2022, we had 185.8 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 39.3 of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans generally have initial terms of five years and amortization terms of 20 to 25 years, with a balloon payment due at the end of the initial term. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75-80 . Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by medical, retail, industrial, warehouse, service or other commercial properties. We originate multi-family loans generally secured by multi-family buildings. At December 31, 2022, the average loan balance of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was 801,000, and the largest of such loans was a 6.4 million loan secured by an industrial warehouse. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2022. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service, amortization, and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.20x. All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers and reviewed by an outside appraisal management firm, all of whom are reviewed by the board of directors. 

7 

Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loan borrowers, although this requirement may be waived in limited circumstances depending upon the creditworthiness of the tenant, loan-to-value ratio and the debt service ratio associated with the loan. We require property, casualty and title insurance and flood insurance if the property is in a flood zone area. 
 Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial and multi-family real estate than residential properties. 
 Commercial Business Lending . At December 31, 2022, we had 54.5 million of commercial business loans, representing 11.5 of our total loan portfolio. We offer regular lines of credit and revolving lines of credit with terms of up to 12 months to small businesses in our market area to finance short-term working capital needs such as accounts receivable and inventory. Our commercial lines of credit are typically adjustable-rate generally based on the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. We generally obtain personal guarantees with respect to all commercial business lines of credit. 
 We typically originate commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business, the experience and stability of the borrower s management team, earnings projections and the underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. Commercial business loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial business loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. In addition, commercial business loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. 
 Construction Lending . We originate construction loans for the purchase of raw land and for the associated construction of commercial properties along with multi and single-family residences. Construction loans provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually twelve months with optional six-month extensions. In many cases the project will include a cash interest reserve set aside in a bank-controlled deposit account to fund these payments through project completion. At the end of the construction phase, many of the loans convert to a permanent mortgage loan. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent appraiser and review by our third-party appraisal review firm. On construction loans greater than 1.0 million, we generally require a plan and cost review by a qualified company to verify construction costs are within market costs and to limit project estimation errors. We also review and engage third-party inspectors to verify the completed work on projects prior to disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. At December 31, 2022, we had 69.2 million of construction loans, representing 14.6 of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, our largest construction loan was a 5.0 million commercial loan secured by land and was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. 
 The maximum loan-to-value of these loans generally is the lesser of 80 of cost or appraised value for owner-occupied properties, and the lesser of 75 of cost or appraised value for investment properties. Personal guarantees are generally required on all such projects. 
 Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property 

8 

with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. Construction loans also expose us to the risks that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs and that repayment will depend on the successful operation or sale of the properties. In addition, some of these borrowers have more than one outstanding loan, so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non-payment and loss. 
 S mall Business Association SBA PPP. In April 2020, we began accepting and processing applications for loans under the PPP implemented by the SBA with support from the Department of Treasury under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act . As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total outstanding balance of approximately 472,000 for round 1 and 2 of PPP loans. The PPP loans have a two-year to four-year term and earn interest at 1 . The SBA fully guarantees the principal and interest, unless the lender violated an obligation under the agreement. 
 Main Street Lending Program. In December 2020, the Company participated in the Main Street Lending Program MSLP established by the Federal Reserve to support lending to small and medium-sized for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP ended on January 8, 2021. At December 31, 2020, the Company funded approximately 31.1 million in loans through the MSLP. At December 31, 2022, the Company had retained approximately 1.6 million, or 5 , of the MSLP it had originated and had sold approximately 95 of the originated loans to the Federal Reserve of Boston. 
 Medical Education Lending. In November 2017, the Bank entered into a loan purchase agreement with a broker to purchase a portfolio of private education loans made to American citizens attending American Medical Association AMA )-approved medical schools in Caribbean nations. The broker serves as a lender, holder, program designer and developer, administrator, and secondary market for the loan portfolios they generate. At December 31, 2022, the balance of the private education loans was 3.7 million. The private student loans were made following a proven credit criteria and were underwritten in accordance with the Bank s policies. At December 31, 2022, there were seven loans with a balance of approximately 514,000 that were past due 90 days or more. Additionally, at this date, we had medical education loans for which a forbearance status has been granted and, while not past due, are classified as non-performing in the amount of 461,000. Generally, the loan may be restored to accrual status when the obligation is in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, generally six months. 
 
 Consumer Lending. At December 31 , 2022 , our consumer loan portfolio totaled 376,000, consisting of consumer overdraft accounts of 67,000 and 309,000 related to other consumer loans offered to customers to assist with funeral expenses. 
 Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales 
 Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel and from referrals from existing customers and real estate brokers. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and pricing levels established by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our loan originations can vary from period to period. 
 Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold on a servicing-released basis most of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we have originated. We consider our Statement of Financial Condition as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. For the year ended December 31 , 2022 , we sold 305.6 million of residential one- to four-family real estate loans. 
 From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary 

9 

loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31 , 20 22 , we had four participation loans for 3.0 million in which we were not the lead lender, each of which was performing in accordance with the loans original repayment terms at December 31 , 20 22 . We also have participated out portions of loans from time to time that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. 
 The following table shows our loan originations, sales and repayment activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 including loans held for sale.

Loans to One Borrower. Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15 of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus (25 if the amount in excess of 15 is secured by readily marketable collateral ). This 15 of unimpaired capital and surplus was approximately 8.6 million as of December 31 , 2022 . At December 31 , 2022 , our largest credit relationship was 6.6 million, which consisted of 3.7 million of commercial business loans secured by private aircraft and 2.9 million of unsecured commercial lines of credit. At December 31 , 2022 , these loans were performing in accordance with its current terms. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors. In the approval process for residential loans, we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan. To assess the borrower s ability to repay, we review the borrower s income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of commercial real estate loans, we also review projected income, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. We generally require appraisals of all real property securing loans. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers who are approved by our board of directors. All real estate secured loans generally require fire, title and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the maximum amount available. Our loan approval policies and limits are also established by our board of directors. All loans originated by the Bank are subject to our underwriting guidelines. 

10 

The following limitations apply to originations of loans. An underwriter may approve loans up to FHA loan limit, and assistant vice president or senior underwriter officer may approve loans up to FHA loan limit. In addition, for jumbo loans, equity loans and HELOCs, an underwriter or senior under writer may approve loans up to 200,000, and assistant vice president or senior underwriter officer may approve loans up to 750,000 and an executive vice president up to 800,000. The Executive Management Committee must approve loans in excess of 800,000. The board of directors must approve loans in excess of 900,000 and higher that are exceptions to the Bank s lending policy. 
 Delinquencies, Non-Performing Assets and Classified Assets 
 Delinquency Procedures. When a loan is 15 days past due, we send the borrower a late notice. We generally also contact the borrower by phone if the delinquency is not corrected promptly after the notice has been sent. When the loan is 30 days past due, we mail the borrower a letter reminding the borrower of the delinquency and attempt to contact the borrower personally to determine the reason for the delinquency in order to ensure that the borrower understands the terms of the loan and the importance of making payments on or before the due date. If necessary, subsequent delinquency notices are issued and the account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. By the 90th day of delinquency, we will send the borrower a final demand for payment and may recommend foreclosure. Loans are charged off when we believe that the recovery of principal is improbable. A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is provided to the board of directors each month.

Non-Performing Loans. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is more than 90 days delinquent. Loans are also placed on non-accrual status if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt or if the loan has been restructured. Loans are classified as troubled debt restructurings when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. At December 31, 2022, we had no non-accruing troubled debt restructurings. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received. Generally, the loan may be restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, generally six months, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned . Other real estate owned includes assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure, are held for sale, and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less estimated selling costs. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in operations. We had 59,000 in real estate owned at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, we had no other real estate owned. 
 Non-Performing Assets. The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We had no accruing loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, we had no non-accruing troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Total non-performing loans decreased to 3.0 million, or 0.64 of total loans, at December 31, 2022 from 3.8 million, or 1.14 of total loans, at December 31, 2021 as a result of decreases of 1.2 million in one construction loan, a decrease of 279,000 in medical education loans and a 95,000 decrease in commercial business loans offset by a 821,000 increase in one-to four-family residential real estate loans compared to December 31, 2021. Non-performing one- to four-family residential real estate loans totaled 1.9 million at December 31, 2022. Non-performing medical education loans totaled 1.1 million at December 31, 2022. Included in the non-performing medical education loans are non-accrual loans that have been brought current through a status change to deferred status. The deferred status generally means the student is in medical residency. Generally, the loan may be restored to accrual status when the obligation is in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, generally six months . There were no non-performing commercial real estate and commercial business loans at December 31, 2022. 
 Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the FDIC to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific allowance for loan losses is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention by our management. At December 31, 2022, we had 1.5 million of loans designated as special mention. 

13 

When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate. General allowances represent allowances which have been established to cover accrued losses associated with lending activities that were both probable and reasonable to estimate, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100 of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances. 
 In connection with the filing of our periodic regulatory reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the watch list initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed. Management reviews the status of each loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis with the full board of directors. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on non-accrual status and classified substandard. 
 The following table sets forth our amounts of classified assets and assets designated as special mention as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The decrease of 828,000 in classified assets was primarily due to decreases of 1.2 million in one substandard construction loan, 279,000 in substandard medical education loans and 95,000 in one substandard commercial business loan offset by an increase of 821,000 in substandard one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Substandard assets at December 31, 2022 consisted of 3.0 million in non-accrual loans and 151,000 in loans that were performing. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses. We maintain the allowance at a level believed, to the best of management s knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses on no less than a quarterly basis in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability for the loan portfolio. The evaluation process includes, among other things, an analysis of delinquency trends, non-performing loan trends, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, prior loss experience, total loans outstanding, the volume of loan originations, the type, size and geographic concentration of the loans, the value of collateral securing the loan, the borrower s ability to repay and repayment performance, the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight, local economic conditions and industry experience. Such risk factors are periodically reviewed by management and revised as deemed appropriate. The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by management s judgment and uncertainties, and there is likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. We adopted CECL effective January 1, 2023 . 

14 

The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. 
 We will continue to monitor and modify our allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. No assurances can be given that the level of allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on the loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses.

At December 31, 2022, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.76 of total loans and 118.54 of non-performing loans. There were 316,000 in net loan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of its examination. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Investment Activities 
 General. Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. Our current investment policy authorizes us to invest in debt securities issued by the United States Government, agencies of the United States Government or United States Government-sponsored enterprises. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities, issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, as well as investments in federal funds and deposits in other insured institutions. In addition, management is authorized to invest in investment grade state and municipal obligations, commercial paper and corporate debt obligations within regulatory parameters. We do not engage in any investment hedging activities or trading activities, nor do we purchase any high-risk mortgage derivative products, corporate junk bonds, and certain types of structured notes. 
 The objectives of the policy are to: 

enhance profitability within our overall asset/liability management objectives 

absorb funds when loan demand is low and infuse funds when demand is high 

provide liquidity necessary to conduct our day to day business activities 

add high credit quality assets to our balance sheet 

improve our interest rate risk management by providing a method for maintaining an appropriate balance between the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of 1) interest income from loans and investments and 2) interest expense from deposits and borrowings 

provide collateral for pledging requirements 

generate a favorable return on investments without compromising other investment objectives and 

evaluate and take advantage of opportunities to generate tax-exempt income when it is appropriate given our tax position. 

 Generally accepted accounting principles require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent to hold such security. Securities designated as available-for -sale are reported at fair value, while securities designated as held- to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. We do not maintain a trading portfolio. Establishing a trading portfolio would require specific authorization by the board of directors. 
 The available-for-sale portfolio, which is carried at fair value, totaled 55.7 million, or 9.0 of total assets at December 31, 2022. The held-to-maturity portfolio, which is carried at amortized cost, totaled 29.8 million, or 4.8 of total assets at December 31, 2022. 
 
 United States Governmental Agency Securities . We maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, 
 for liquidity purposes and as collateral for borrowings. At December 31, 2022, United States government and agency securities consisted of a fixed-rate Small Business Administration SBA Participation Certificates which had a zero-risk weighting for capital purposes and seven United States agency securities. 
 
 United States Treasury Securities. We maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes and as collateral for borrowings. At December 31, 2022, United States treasury securities consisted of two year treasury notes. 
 Corporate Notes . At time of purchase, we invest in investment grade corporate bonds, both fixed and floating rate instruments, and generally consisting of corporate bonds issued by large financial institutions. 
 Collateralized Mortgage Obligations . We invest in fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. A CMO is a type of mortgage-backed security that creates separate pools of pass-through rates for different classes of bondholders with varying maturities, called tranches. 

18 

The repayments from the pool of pass-through securities are used to retire the bonds in the order specified by the bonds prospectus. 
 Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration. The timely payment of principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. government with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities- Agency Residential . We invest in mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. We have not purchased privately-issued mortgage-backed securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. 
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. 
 Municipal Securities . We invest in fixed-rate investment grade bonds issued primarily by municipalities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
 Bank Certificates of Deposit . We invest in certificates of deposit issued by geographically dispersed large financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC.

Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We may also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances to supplement cash flow needs, as necessary. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, retained income and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents, municipalities and businesses within our market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and checking accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. At December 31, 2022, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were 458.2 million, representing 87.2 of total deposits. At December 31, 2022, there was 40.9 million in brokered certificates of deposit outstanding. 
 Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers demands. Our ability to generate deposits is affected by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates.

Subsidiary Activities 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HV Bancorp. Huntingdon Valley Bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary, HVB Investment Management Inc. formed under the laws of the state of Delaware, as an investment company subsidiary to hold and manage certain investments. HVB Investment Management Inc. became operational in January 2021. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 131 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
 Regulation and Supervision 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a savings bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The lending, investment, and other business operations of the Bank are governed by Pennsylvania law and regulations, as well as applicable federal law and regulations, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not authorized by such laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC. This regulation 

23 

and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. The Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments govern the classification of assets determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes and establish the timing and amounts of insurance assessments and other fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. The receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as the Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network. 
 As a bank holding company, HV Bancorp is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"). It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. HV Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of HV Bancorp and the Bank. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and HV Bancorp. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and HV Bancorp. 
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 
 In 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the EGRRCPA was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The EGRRCPA s highlights include, among other things: (i) exempting banks with less than 10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio (ii) not requiring appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than 400,000 in rural areas (iii) exempting banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from HMDA s expanded data disclosures (iv) clarifying that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC s brokered-deposit regulations (v) raising eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from 1 billion to banks with 3 billion in assets and (vi) simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under 10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8 and not greater than 10 that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status. 
 Federal law required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 and 10 for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9 Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8 or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. 

24 

At December 31, 2022, Huntingdon Valley Bank had not opted into the community bank leverage ratio framework and its capital ratios exceeded all applicable requirements. 
 Pennsylvania Bank Regulation 
 Activity Powers. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking regulates the internal organization of the Bank, as well as our activities, including, deposit-taking, lending and investment. The basic authority for our activities is specified by Pennsylvania law and by regulations, policies and directives issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. The FDIC also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, and federal law limits some of the authority that the Pennsylvania Department of Banking grants to us. 
 Examination and Enforcement. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking regularly examines state chartered banks in such areas as reserves, loans, investments, management practices and other aspects of operations. Although the Pennsylvania Department of Banking may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of its own examinations, the current practice is for the Pennsylvania Department of Banking to conduct individual examinations. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may immediately suspend, remove, and permanently bar any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after a hearing before the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking may also issue civil penalties against the bank or any officer or director of the bank for violation of law or unsafe and unsound conduct. 
 Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15 of a savings bank s capital accounts. Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, loans which are secured by collateral which has a market value of not less than 120 of the amount of the obligations secured by such collateral are excluded from the loan-to-one-borrower limitation up to an aggregate limit for 15 of the savings bank s capital accounts. 
 Loans to Huntingdon Valley Bank s Insiders . Pennsylvania law provides that we may make loans to our executive officers and directors and greater than 10 stockholders in accordance with federal regulations, as discussed below. 
 Dividend Restrictions. HV Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, Huntingdon Valley Bank. There are various legal and regulatory restrictions on the extent to which Huntingdon Valley Bank can, among other things, finance or otherwise supply funds to HV Bancorp. Specifically, dividends from Huntingdon Valley Bank are the principal source of HV Bancorp s cash funds and there are certain legal restrictions under Pennsylvania law and regulations on the payment of dividends by state-chartered banks. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board also have authority to prohibit HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank from engaging in certain practices deemed to be unsafe and unsound. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the condition of HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 
 The Pennsylvania Banking Code regulates the distribution of dividends by banks and states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings. In addition, we may not declare and pay dividends from the surplus funds that Pennsylvania law requires that we maintain. Each year we will be required to set aside as surplus funds a sum equal to not less than 10 of our net earnings until the surplus funds equal 100 of our capital stock. We may invest surplus funds in the same manner as deposits, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if a savings bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC. 
 Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking impose on Pennsylvania chartered depository institutions, including Huntingdon Valley Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See Federal Bank Regulation Capital Requirements . 
 Federal Bank Regulation 
 Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require state savings banks to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio a total capital to risk-based assets ratio and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The capital standards were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of regulations implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel III and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

25 

The risk-based capital standards for state savings banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets ratios of at least 4.5 , 6 and 8 , respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 Federal law required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 and 10 for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9 Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8 or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank s capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 Investment Activities. All FDIC insured banks, including savings banks, are generally limited in their equity investment activities to equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, a state bank may engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined by the FDIC that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, recent 

26 

amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 , or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . 
 
 The previously referenced final rule establishing an elective community bank leverage ratio regulatory capital framework provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered well-capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action . 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0 of the institution s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation W limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0 of such institution s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0 of such institution s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 

27 

Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0 stockholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these persons, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Huntingdon Valley Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Huntingdon Valley Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Huntingdon Valley Bank are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution's failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5 , the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increase would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Huntingdon Valley Bank. In October 2022, the FDIC increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, effective January 1, 2023. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 
 Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that Huntingdon Valley Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer s non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Huntingdon Valley Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Huntingdon Valley Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by federal regulations, a state member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state savings bank, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires a written evaluation of an institution s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Huntingdon Valley Bank s latest federal CRA rating was Satisfactory. 
 USA Patriot Act. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

28 

Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Huntingdon Valley Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit 

Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies and 

Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws. 

 The deposit operations of Huntingdon Valley Bank also are subject to, among others, the: 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records 

Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check and 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

Truth is Savings Act and Regulation DD, which provides uniform standards for disclosure of deposit account terms, interest rates and fee disclosures. 

 Federal Reserve System 
 Under federal law and regulations, Huntingdon Valley Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound banking practices. Regulation D, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, imposes reserve requirements on all depository institutions, including the Huntingdon Valley Bank, which maintain transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. In March 2020, due to a change in its approach to monetary policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board implemented a final rule to amend Regulation D requirements and reduce reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements, but may do so in the future if conditions warrant. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Huntingdon Valley Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2022. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Huntingdon Valley Bank reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh stock. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment has been recognized. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 HV Bancorp, as a bank holding company, is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. HV Bancorp is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for HV Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5 of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities 

29 

found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans (ii) performing certain data processing services (iii) providing securities brokerage services (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare and (vii) acquiring a savings association. 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institution subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed, to opt to become a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. HV Bancorp has not elected to become a financial holding company. 
 HV Bancorp is not subject to the Federal Reserve Board s consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies. The EGRRCPA required the Federal Reserve Board to generally extend its "Small Bank Holding Company" exemption from consolidated holding company capital requirements to bank and savings and loan holding companies of up to 3 billion in assets. Regulations implementing the new legislation were effective in August 2018. Consequently, bank holding companies with less than 3 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise in particular cases. 
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. The Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance which requires consultation with the Federal Reserve Board prior to a redemption or repurchase in certain circumstances. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of HV Bancorp to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of HV Bancorp or Huntingdon Valley Bank. 
 HV Bancorp s status as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 HV Bancorp common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. HV Bancorp is also subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in HV Bancorp s public offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of HV Bancorp may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of HV Bancorp will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If HV Bancorp meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of HV Bancorp that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate s sale to be aggregated with 

30 

those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1 of the outstanding shares of HV Bancorp, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, HV Bancorp may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as HV Bancorp unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25 of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a bank holding company s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with HV Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a bank holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 TAXATION 
 Federal Taxation 
 General. HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank. 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Huntingdon Valley Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and used a tax year ending December 31. 
 Bad Debt Reserves . Historically, Huntingdon Valley Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1988. Huntingdon Valley Bank recaptured its excess reserve balance. 
 Currently, Huntingdon Valley Bank uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. At December 31, 2022, our total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately 1.7 million upon which no deferred taxes have been provided. Under current law, pre-base year reserves remain subject to recapture should Huntingdon Valley Bank make certain non-dividend distributions, repurchase any of its stock, pay dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or cease to maintain a bank charter. 

31 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. The Tax Act repealed carrying back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. The Tax Act provides for the indefinite carryforward of federal net operating losses arising in tax years ending after 2017. Also as a result of The Tax Act, net operating losses arising in tax years after 2017 may only reduce 80 percent of a taxpayer s taxable income in carryforward years. At December 31 , 20 2 2 , Huntingdon Valley Bank had no federal net operating loss carryforwards and had no Pennsylvania state net operating loss carryforwards available for future use. 
 Capital Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2022, Huntingdon Valley Bank had no capital loss carryover. 
 Corporate Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100 of dividends received from Huntingdon Valley Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 Audit of Tax Returns. Huntingdon Valley Bank s income tax returns have not been audited in the past five years. 
 State Taxation 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank currently files Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institution Income Tax returns. Generally, the income of savings institutions in Pennsylvania, which is calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to Pennsylvania tax. Huntingdon Valley Bank had no Pennsylvania state tax net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2022. In addition, Huntingdon Valley Bank filed Corporate Business Tax returns with the State of New Jersey and Delaware.

 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of these legal actions as of December 31, 2022 is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, no material proceedings are pending, are known to be threatened, or contemplated against the Company by governmental authorities.

Item 5. 
 
 Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

 Our shares of common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol HVBC . The approximate number of holders of record of HV Bancorp, Inc. s common stock as of March 16, 2023 was 106. Certain shares of HV Bancorp s are held in nominee or street name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing number. HV Bancorp, Inc. began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on January 12, 2017. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not pay a cash dividend per share. The Board of Directors has the authority to declare cash dividends on shares of common stock, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. In determining whether and in what amount to pay a cash dividend, the Board takes into account a number of factors, including capital requirements, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory limitations and general economic conditions. No assurances can be given that cash dividends will be paid again or that, if paid, will not be reduced. 
 The available sources of funds for the payment of a cash dividend in the future are interest and principal payments with respect to HV Bancorp s loan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, interest and principal payments on investment securities and dividends from Huntingdon Valley Bank. 
 Under the rules of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board, Huntingdon Valley Bank is not permitted to make a capital distribution if, after making such distribution, it would be undercapitalized. For information concerning additional federal and state laws and regulations regarding the ability of Huntingdon Valley Bank to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends to HV Bancorp, see Item 1 Business Taxation Federal Taxation Item 1 Business Pennsylvania Bank Regulation-Dividend Restriction and Item 1 Business Supervision and Regulation. 
 Unlike Huntingdon Valley Bank, the Company is not restricted by FDIC regulations on the payment of dividends to its shareholders. However, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of HV Bancorp s to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 The equity compensation plan information presented under subparagraph (b) in Part III, Item 12 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. During April 2019, a stock repurchase plan was approved to purchase up to 100,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. Further, in February 2021, the Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase in the open market and privately negotiated transactions, up to 100,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. This plan supplements the previous repurchase plan. During the quarter end December 31, 2022, 151 shares at an average cost of 21.05 per share had been repurchased.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the audited consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 46 of this annual report. 
 Overview 
 HV Bancorp, Inc., through the Bank, provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and from our seven full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Philadelphia, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania and Mount Laurel, New Jersey. We also operate a limited service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our administrative offices and executive offices are located in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Our Business Banking office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have loan production and sales offices located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania, Burlington County in New Jersey and New Castle County in Delaware. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), construction loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities. 
 Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees for customer services, gain (loss) from derivative instruments, gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights, net, change in fair value of loans held-for-sale and sales of securities. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing related operations, professional fees and other expenses . 
 Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general, regional, and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 
 Merger with Citizens Financial 
 As previously announced, on October 18, 2022, the Company, the Bank, Citizens Financial Services, Inc. Citizens Financial ), First Citizens Community Bank FCCB and CZFS Acquisition Company, LLC entered into a merger agreement that provides that the Company will merge with and into Citizens Financial, with Citizens Financial remaining as the surviving corporation (the Merger ). Following the Merger, the Bank will merge with and into FCCB, with FCCB remaining as the surviving bank (the Bank Merger ). 
 The Company s shareholders approved the Merger on February 15, 2023. On March 24, 2023, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities approved the Merger and the Bank Merger. On March 30, 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System approved the Bank Merger and waived the application for the Merger. The completion of the Merger and the Bank Merger remain subject to customary closing conditions. The Merger is expected to close in the first half of 2023. 
 At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Company common stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of such holder, either (i) 0.4000 shares of Citizens Financial common stock, or (ii) 30.50 in cash, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any. All such elections are subject to adjustment on a pro rata basis, so that 80 of the aggregate merger consideration paid to the Company shareholders will be the stock consideration and the remaining 20 will be the cash consideration.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 
 The following represents our critical accounting estimates: 
 Allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. 
 The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Bank s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
 The allowance consists of specific, and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. 
 These qualitative risk factors include: 

Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices 

National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 

Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans 

Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications 

Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations and 

Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. 

 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. On January 1, 2023, we adopted CECL.

See Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report . 
 
 Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
 Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. See also Note 14 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investment Securities. Securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether declines in their value are other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of fair value. The term other-than-temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit losses) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). 
 Fair Value Measurements . Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and our methodology can be found in Note 15 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this transition report on Form 10-K.

Outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. We are subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. We have used mandatory commitments

to substantially reduce these risks. See Note 1 1 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company in this annual report . 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 
 Total Assets 
 Total assets increased 55.7 million to 615.8 million at December 31, 2022, from 560.1 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of increases of 143.8 million in loans receivable, net, 40.9 million in investment securities, 3.7 million in bank-owned life insurance and 1.1 million in other assets, which were offset by decreases of 104.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, 25.3 million in loans held-for-sale and 3.2 million in mortgage servicing rights. 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 104.5 million to 16.3 million at December 31, 2022 from 120.8 million at December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increased funding of loans and purchases of investment securities. 
 Investment Securities 
 Investment securities increased by 40.9 million to 85.4 million at December 31, 2022 from 44.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to purchases of 61.9 million of U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed, collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate notes offset by 15.8 million in proceeds from sales and maturities and principal repayments during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2.3 million in net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities and 2.3 million in net unrealized loss on securities transferred to held-to-maturity. The increase in comprehensive loss in the available-for-sale portfolio reflects recent increases in market interest rates. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our held-to-maturity portion of the securities portfolio, at amortized cost, was 29.8 million, and our available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was 55.7 million compared to 44.5 million of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2021.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Provision for Loan Losses 
 We establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change . 
 This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses increased by 982,000 to 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of increased originations in commercial real estate and other commercial business loans . During the year ended December 31, 2022, total charge-offs of 397,000 were recorded and 81,000 of recoveries were received. During the year ended December 31, 2021, total charge-offs of 210,000 were recorded and 8,000 of recoveries were received.

Non-Interest Income 
 Non-interest income decreased 5.5 million to 7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income compared to 2021 was primarily due to decreases of 8.4 million in the gain on sale of loans offset by a 1.0 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights, net, a 730,000 increase in change in fair value of loans held-for-sale, a 426,000 decrease in loss from derivative instruments, an increase of 348,000 in other income and an increase of 338,000 in fees for customer services . The gain on sale of loans, net decreased 8.4 million to 6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of lower volume of loan sales, which decreased 365.0 million from 670.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 305.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity Management . Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. In addition, we can use brokered certificates of deposit as a funding source of our asset base. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had brokered certificates of deposit of 40.9 million, or 6.6 of total asset with an average cost of 3.77 . As of December 31, 2021, there were no brokered certificates of deposit outstanding. 
 We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of 27.0 million outstanding with unused borrowing capacity of 115.8 million as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow 6.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank. We have not borrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of December 31, 2022. 
 We monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand (2) expected deposit flows (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earnings deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled 16.3 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled 55.7 million at December 31, 2022. 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 30.5 million and 42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was 193.0 million and 32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold 10.0 million and 5.5 million, respectively, in securities available-for-sale. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 58.0 million and 304.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of an increase in deposits of 61.2 million offset by repayments of 3.1 million to the PPPLF. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of a decrease in deposits of 266.8 million, repayments of 45.6 million from the PPPLF offset by proceeds of 10.0 million from the issuance of subordinated debt. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2022, totaled 57.9 million, or 11.0 , of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or 

44 

borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered . 
 Capital Management. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning Statement of Financial Condition assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2022, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 30.7 million and unused lines of credit totaling 94.2 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022 totaled 57.9 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 
 Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

R EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of HV Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of HV Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 472.5 million as of December 31, 2022, and the associated ALL was 3.6 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in economic conditions, volume and severity of past-due loans, nonaccrual and adversely classified loans, nature and volume of portfolio, value of underlying collateral, lending policies and procedures, lending management experience, depth, and ability, quality of loan review system and board oversight, effect of concentrations in credit and changes in level of such concentrations, and external factors. 
 
 We identified these qualitative adjustments within the ALL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. In turn, auditing management s judgments regarding the qualitative factors applied in the ALL calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. 
 
 To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL and the need to consider qualitative adjustments. 
 
 Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data and third-party macroeconomic data. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Company s loan portfolio, and asset quality trends, which included the evaluation of management s ability to capture and assess relevant data from both external sources and internal reports on loan customers and the supporting documentation for substantiating revisions to qualitative factors. 
 
 We also utilized internal credit review specialists with knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of management s risk-rating processes, to ensure that the risk ratings applied to the commercial loan portfolio were reasonable. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018 .

 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements , to be in approximately . These estimates are subject to further refinements based on ongoing evaluations of our model, methodologies, and judgments, as well as prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios. 
 
 At adoption, the Company expects an allowance for credit losses to be for securities classified as HTM debt securities. allowance was recorded related to AFS debt securities at the date of adoption, January 1, 2023. 
 
 In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Derivatives, and Hedging (Topic 815) and Financial Instruments (Topic 825), which affects a variety of topics in the Codification and applies to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. ASU 2019-04 makes clarifying amendments to certain financial instrument standards. For entities that have not yet adopted ASU 2016-13, the effective dates for the amendments related to ASU 2016-13 are the same as the effective dates in ASU 2016-13. For entities that have not yet adopted ASU 2017-12 as of April 25, 2019, the effective dates for the amendments to Topic 815 are the same as the effective dates in ASU 2017-12. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company and does not expect to early adopt these ASUs. 
 
 In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which allows entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost upon adoption of the new credit losses standard. To be eligible for the transition election, the existing financial asset must otherwise be both within the scope of the new credit losses standard and eligible for applying the fair value option in ASC 825-10.3. The election must be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is not available for either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities. For entities that elect the fair value option, the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the financial asset would be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the date an entity adopted ASU 2016-13. Changes in fair value of that financial asset would subsequently be reported in current earnings. For entities that have not yet adopted the credit losses standard, the ASU is effective when they implement the credit losses standard. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company and have not adopted ASU 2016-13. 
 
 In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, to clarify its new credit impairment guidance in ASC 326, based on implementation issues raised by stakeholders. This Update clarified, among other things, that expected recoveries are to be included in the allowance for credit losses for these financial assets an accounting policy election can be made to adjust the effective interest rate for existing troubled debt restructurings based on the prepayment assumptions instead of the prepayment assumptions applicable immediately prior to the restructuring event and extends the practical expedient to exclude accrued interest receivable from all additional relevant disclosures involving amortized cost basis. For entities that have not yet adopted ASU 2016-13 as of November 26, 2019, the effective dates for ASU 2019-11 are the same as the effective dates and transition requirements in ASU 2016-13. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company and have not adopted ASU 2016-13. 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments. This ASU was issued to improve and clarify various financial instruments topics, including the current expected credit losses (CECL) standard issued in 2016. The ASU includes seven issues that describe the areas of improvement and the related amendments to GAAP they are intended to make the standards easier to understand and apply and to eliminate inconsistencies, and they are narrow in scope and are not expected to significantly change practice for most entities. Among its provisions, the ASU clarifies that all entities, other than public business entities that elected the fair value option, are required to provide certain fair value disclosures under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, in both interim and annual financial statements. It also clarifies that the contractual term of a net investment in a lease under Topic 842 should be the contractual term used to measure expected credit losses under Topic 326.

 The Bank may grant a concession or modification for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial condition that it would not otherwise consider resulting in a modified loan that is then identified as a troubled debt restructuring TDR ). The Company may modify loans through rate reductions, extensions of maturity, interest only payments, or payment modifications to better match the timing of cash flows due under the modified terms with the cash flows from the borrowers' operations. Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. TDRs are disclosed as and considered impaired loans for purposes of calculating the Company's allowance for loan losses. 
 The Bank may identify loans for potential restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower's financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had loans identified as TDRs totaling and , respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the TDRs were performing in compliance with their restructured terms and on an accrual status.

The Small Business Job Protection Act (the Act) eliminated the special bad debt deduction granted solely to thrifts. Under the terms of the Act, there would be no recapture of the pre-1988 (base year) reserves. However, these pre-1988 reserves would be subject to recapture under the rules of the Internal Revenue Code if the Company pays a cash dividend in excess of earnings and profits, or liquidates.

 Management along with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 utilizing the framework established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 is effective. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of assets and provide reasonable assurances that: (1) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (2) receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company and (3) unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements are prevented or timely detected. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.

Employment Agreement with Travis J. Thompson 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank entered into individual employment agreement with Travis J. Thompson which has an initial term of three years. Commencing on the first anniversary date of the agreement and continuing on each anniversary date thereafter, the term of the agreement will renew for one year, unless written notice of non-renewal is provided by the Board of Directors at least 30 days prior to any anniversary date. Prior to each notice period for non-renewal, the disinterested members of the Board of Directors will conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the executive for purposes of determining whether to take action regarding non-renewal of his employment agreement. 

108 

The employment agreement provides a base salary for Mr. Thompson in the amount of 200,000 . The base salary may be increased, but not decreased (other than a decrease which is applicable to all senior officers). In addition to base salary, the executive will be entitled to participate in any bonus program and benefit plan made available to senior management employees, and will be reimbursed for all reasonable business expenses incurred. 
 In the event of the executive s involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than cause, disability or death, or in the event of his resignation for good reason, (a qualifying termination event ), the executive will receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the amount base salary that he would have earned had he remained employed for the duration of his benefit period. The benefit period for Mr. Thompson is 12 months or, if greater, the remaining term of his agreement as of his date of termination. In addition, the executive will be entitled to receive life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental insurance coverage substantially comparable to the coverage maintained by Huntingdon Valley Bank for the aforementioned benefit period or, if earlier, until the date on which the executive becomes a full-time employee of another employer and receives comparable health and welfare benefits. For purposes of the employment agreement, good reason is defined as: (1) a material reduction in base salary or benefits (other than reduction by Huntingdon Valley Bank that is part of a good faith, overall reduction of such benefits applicable to all employees) (2) a material reduction in the executive s duties or responsibilities (3) a relocation of the executive s principal place of employment by more than 25 miles from the executive s principal place of employment as of the initial effective date of the employment agreement or (4) a material breach of the employment agreement by Huntingdon Valley Bank. In order to be entitled to the severance benefits set forth above, the executive will be required to enter into a release of claims against Huntingdon Valley Bank related to his employment. 
 If the executive s qualifying termination event occurs on or after the effective date of a change in control of HV Bancorp, Inc. or Huntingdon Valley Bank, the executive will be entitled to (in lieu of the payments and benefits described in the previous paragraph) a severance payment equal to three times the executive s highest annual rate of base salary and bonus paid, or earned, during the calendar year of the change in control or either of the two calendar years immediately preceding the change in control. Such payment will be payable in a lump sum within 30 days following the executive s date of termination. In addition, Huntingdon Valley Bank (or its successor) will continue to provide the executive with life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental insurance coverage substantially comparable to the coverage provided to the executive immediately prior to his date of termination at no cost to the executive. Such continued coverage will cease upon the earlier of: (1) the date which is three years after the executive s date of termination or (2) the date on which the executive becomes a full-time employee of another employer and receives comparable health and welfare benefits. 
 In addition, if the executive dies while employed, the executive s estate or beneficiary will be paid his base salary for one year following death, and his family will continue to receive non-taxable medical and dental coverage for one year after his death. The executive will not receive any additional compensation or benefits under his employment agreement in the event he becomes disabled. 
 Concurrent with the signing of the merger agreement with Citizens Financial Services, Inc., Mr. Thompson entered into a settlement and non-competition and non-solicitation agreement with HV Bancorp, Huntingdon Valley Bank and Citizens Financial Services, Inc., that will terminate and supersede his employment agreement effective as of the closing date of the merger. As a result, Mr. Thompson will not receive any payments or benefits under the employment agreement in connection with the merger. 
 
 Employment Agreement with Robert J. Marino 
 
 HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank entered into an employment agreement with Robert J. Marino, President of HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank, originally effective as of December 1, 2021. The employment agreement provides that, if a change in control of HV Bancorp occurs and if Mr. Marino experiences an involuntary termination of employment, or he resigns for good reason (as defined in the agreement), and if Mr. Marino has completed fewer than three full years of service, Mr. Marino will be entitled to a severance payment equal to two times his annual rate of base salary. The payment will be payable in a lump sum within 30 days following his date of termination of employment. In addition, Huntingdon Valley Bank (or its successor) will continue to provide him with all life, disability, medical insurance and other normal health and welfare benefits in effect with respect to the executive at the time of termination of employment. Such continued coverage will cease upon the earlier of: (1) the date which is one year after his date of termination of employment or (2) the date on 

109 

which he secures comparable coverage though other employment. If the aggregate amount of payments to Mr. Marino in connection with a change in control would be subject to an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount payable to Mr. Marino under his employment agreement would be reduced as necessary to avoid the imposition of such excise tax. 
 
 Concurrent with the signing of the merger agreement, Mr. Marino entered into a settlement and non-competition and non-solicitation agreement with HV Bancorp, Huntingdon Valley Bank, and Citizens Financial Services, Inc. that will terminate and supersede his employment agreement effective as of the closing date of the merger. As a result, Mr. Marino will not receive any payments or benefits under the employment agreement in connection with the merger. 
 
 Bonuses 
 Discretionary Bonuses . The Compensation Committee has the authority to award discretionary bonus payments to the named executive officers. While strict numerical formulas are not used to quantify the named executive officers bonus payments, both company-wide and individually-based performance objectives are used to determine bonus payments. Company-wide performance objectives focus on earnings, growth, expense control and asset quality, which are customary metrics used by similarly-situated financial institutions in measuring performance. Individually-based performance objectives are determined based on the individual s responsibilities and contributions to our successful operation. Both the company-wide and individually-based performance objectives are evaluated by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis and also as a trend of performance measured over the prior three years. The Compensation Committee also takes into consideration outside factors that impact our performance, such as national and local economic conditions, the interest rate environment, regulatory mandates and the level of competition in our primary market area. 
 Based on the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2022, Messrs. Thompson, Marino and Connelly earned a bonus of 144,000, 80,000 and 60,000, respectively, in recognition of their performance and effort. 
 
 B enefit Plans 
 
 401(k) Plan . Huntingdon Valley Bank maintains the Huntingdon Valley Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the 401(k) Plan ). The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan just like any other employee. Employees of the Bank are eligible to participate in the Plan when the individual has satisfied the eligibility condition of attainment of age of 21 . However, an employee will actually become a participant in the plan once the employee reaches the entry date which is the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the date the individual satisfied the eligibility requirement. 
 Under the 401(k) Plan a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 96 of his or her salary in any plan year, subject to limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2022, the salary deferral contribution limit is 20,500, provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional 6,500, for a total contribution of 27,000. In addition to salary deferral contributions, Huntingdon Valley Bank may make during the plan year: (1) a discretionary matching contribution to each participant s account based on a percentage of the participant s salary deferral contribution and/or (2) a profit sharing contribution that would be allocated to each participant s account pro-rata on the basis of each participant s compensation relative to the aggregate compensation of all participants. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was no profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) Plan. A participant is always 100 vested in his or her salary deferral contributions. However, a participant will vest in his or her employer contributions at a rate of 20 per year after the completion of two years of credited service, such that the participant will be 100 vested upon completion of six years of credited service. The 401(k) Plan permits a participant to direct the investment of his or her own account into various investment options offered, including HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock through the Stock Fund. 
 Generally, a participant (or participant s beneficiary) may receive a distribution from his or her vested account beginning at retirement, age 59 1 2 (while employed with Huntingdon Valley Bank), death, disability or termination of employment, and elect for the distribution to be paid in the form of a lump sum payment or annuity or installment payments.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Concurrent with the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Huntingdon Valley Bank and initial public offering of HV Bancorp, Inc. (collectively, the conversion ), Huntingdon Valley Bank adopted the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP for eligible employees. Eligible employees who have attained age 21 and are employed with Huntingdon Valley Bank as of January 11, 2017, began participation in the ESOP on the later of the effective date of the ESOP or upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee s completion of 1,000 hours of service during a continuous 12-month period. 
 On behalf of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee purchased 174,570 shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock issued in the after-market following the completion of the conversion. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan from HV Bancorp, Inc. equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The loan will be repaid principally through Huntingdon Valley Bank s contribution to the ESOP and dividends payable on common stock held by the ESOP over the anticipated 20-year term of the loan. The initial interest rate for the ESOP loan was an adjustable rate equal to the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal , on January 11, 2017. Thereafter the interest rate will adjust annually and will be the prime rate on the first business day of the calendar year, retroactive to January 1 of such year. 
 The trustee will hold the shares purchased by the ESOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the trustee repays the loan. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant s proportional share of compensation relative to all participants. Each participant will vest in his or her benefit at a rate of 20 per year beginning in the second year, such that the participant will be fully vested upon completion of six years of credited service. However, each participant who was employed by Huntingdon Valley Bank prior to the offering will receive credit for vesting purposes for years of service prior to the adoption of the ESOP. A participant also will become fully vested automatically in his or her benefit upon normal retirement, death or disability, or termination of the ESOP. Generally, a participant will receive a distribution from the ESOP upon separation from service. The ESOP reallocates any unvested shares forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants. 
 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. On June 13, 2018, the stockholders of HV Bancorp, Inc. approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan which provides for the grant of stock based awards to its employees, directors and executive officers of HV Bancorp, Inc. and Huntingdon Valley Bank. The 2018 Equity Plan authorizes the issuance or delivery of up to 305,497 shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units provided, however, that the maximum number of shares of stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options is 218,212 and the maximum number of shares of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units that may be granted is 87,285 shares. 
 
 The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the members of HV Bancorp, Inc. s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who are Disinterested Board Members as defined in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee has the authority and discretion to select the persons who will receive the awards establish the terms and conditions relating to each award adopt rules and regulations relating to the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and interpret the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan also permits the Compensation Committee to delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers. 
 
 Our executive officers and outside directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Awards may be granted in a combination of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, incentive stock options, and non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan may not be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option is granted. Stock options are subject to vesting conditions and restrictions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Stock awards under 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be granted only in whole shares of common stock. All restricted stock and stock option grants will be subject to conditions established by the Compensation Committee that are set forth in the award agreement. 
 
 The stock option and restricted stock awards granted to named executive officers will vest over a seven-year period, with 16 percent becoming vested after the completion of one year of service following the date of grant and then 14 percent becoming vested each year of continued service thereafter for the next six years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these awards would vest upon death, disability or involuntary termination of 

111 

employment following a change in control. The time-based component of the awards serves as a retention tool for the named executive officers, and the stock options are viewed by the Compensation Committee as performance-based because value is only realized if there is stock price appreciation over the term of the options. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, 3,997 shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock were available for awards under the 2018 Equity Stock Incentive Plan. 
 2021 Equity Incentive Plan.

The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of up to 175,000 shares of Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. No employee participant may receive more than 20 , or 35,000 shares, of the awards available under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, all of which, may be granted during any calendar year. 
 
 The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the members of HV Bancorp, Inc. s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who are Disinterested Board Members as defined in the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee has the authority and discretion to select the persons who will receive the awards establish the terms and conditions relating to each award adopt rules and regulations relating to the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and interpret the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan also permits the Compensation Committee to delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers. 
 
 Our executive officers and outside directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. Awards may be granted in a combination of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, incentive stock options, and non-qualified stock options. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be awarded to non-employee directors under the plan is 52,500 shares or 30 of the shares available under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan may not be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option is granted. Stock options are subject to vesting conditions and restrictions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Stock awards under 2021 Equity Incentive Plan will be granted only in whole shares of common stock. All restricted stock and stock option grants will be subject to conditions established by the Compensation Committee that are set forth in the award agreement. 
 
 A total of 80,000 restricted stock shares and 35,000 stock options were awarded by the Compensation Committee under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan during 2022 with 60,000 shares available for future awards under this plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, these awards would vest upon death, disability or involuntary termination of employment following a change in control.

Item 13. 
 
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 

 Transactions with Certain Related Persons 
 Loans and Extensions of Credit. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits publicly traded companies from making loans to their executive officers and directors, but it contains a specific exemption from such prohibition for loans made by federally insured financial institutions, such as Huntingdon Valley Bank, to their executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking regulations. 
 The aggregate outstanding amount of our loans to our executive officers, directors and their related parties was 8.6 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, all of our loans to directors, executive officers and their related parties were made in the ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Huntingdon Valley Bank, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. These loans were performing according to their original terms at December 31, 2022, and were made in compliance with federal banking regulations. 
 Additionally, any transactions that would be required to be reported must be reviewed by our audit committee or another independent body of the Board of Directors. Any transaction with a director is reviewed by and subject to approval of the members of the Board of Directors who are not directly involved in the proposed transaction to confirm that the transaction is on terms that are no more favorable than those that would be available to us from an unrelated third party through an arms-length transaction. 

116 

Board Independence 
 The Board of Directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Travis J. Thompson and Vice Chair and President Robert J. Marino, is independent as defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Marino are not independent because each is an executive officer of HV Bancorp, Inc. In determining the independence of the other directors, the Board of Directors considered loans made to Director Asplundh and/or his related parties .

 Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services, which relate primarily to tax compliance services and tax advice rendered was compatible with maintaining the independence of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. The Audit Committee concluded that performing such services did not affect the independence of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. in performing its function as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
 The Audit Committee s policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, either by approving an engagement prior to the engagement or pursuant to a pre-approval policy with respect to particular services. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more members of the Audit Committee when expedition of services is necessary. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. The audit-related fees and all other fees described above were approved as part of our engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C.

Exhibit 4.6 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK OF HV BANCORP, INC. 
 General 
 HV Bancorp is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of 0.01 per share, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. As of March 10, 2023, there were 2,237,213 shares of HV Bancorp common stock and no shares of HV Bancorp preferred stock outstanding. Each share of HV Bancorp common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of common stock. 
 Common Stock 
 Dividends. HV Bancorp cannot pay dividends on its common stock if, after giving effect to such distribution, (i) HV Bancorp would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) HV Bancorp s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if HV Bancorp were to be dissolved at the time the distribution is measured, to satisfy the stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. The holders of common stock of HV Bancorp are entitled to receive and share equally in dividends as may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. If HV Bancorp issues shares of preferred stock, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock with respect to dividends. 
 Voting Rights. The holders of common stock of HV Bancorp have exclusive voting rights in HV Bancorp. They elect HV Bancorp s board of directors and act on other matters as are required to be presented to them under Pennsylvania law or as are otherwise presented to them by the board of directors. Generally, each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share and does not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Any person who beneficially owns more than 10 of the then-outstanding shares of HV Bancorp s common stock, however, will not be entitled or permitted to vote any shares of common stock held in excess of the 10 limit absent certain exceptions. If HV Bancorp issues shares of preferred stock, holders of the preferred stock may also possess voting rights. Amendments to the articles of incorporation generally require, in addition to majority approval by the board of directors, majority approval of the outstanding shares eligible to vote, and certain amendments may require the approval of 75 of the outstanding shares eligible to vote if the board of directors has not approved such amendment. 
 As a Pennsylvania stock savings bank, corporate powers and control of Huntingdon Valley Bank are vested in its board of directors, who elect the officers of Huntingdon Valley Bank and who fill any vacancies on the board of directors. Voting rights of Huntingdon Valley Bank are vested exclusively in the owner of the shares of capital stock of Huntingdon Valley Bank, which is HV Bancorp, and voted at the direction of HV Bancorp s board of directors. Consequently, the holders of the common stock of HV Bancorp will not have direct control of Huntingdon Valley Bank. 
 Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Huntingdon Valley Bank, HV Bancorp, as the holder of 100 of Huntingdon Valley Bank s capital stock, would be entitled to receive all assets of Huntingdon Valley Bank available for distribution, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of Huntingdon Valley Bank, including all deposit accounts and accrued interest thereon, and after distribution of the balance in the liquidation account to Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or 

winding up of HV Bancorp , the holders of its common stock would be entitled to receive, after payment or provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities, all of the assets of HV Bancorp available for distribution. If preferred stock is issued, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock in the event of liquidation or dissolution. 
 Preemptive Rights. Holders of the common stock of HV Bancorp are not entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued, unless such preemptive rights are approved by the board of directors. The common stock is not subject to redemption. 
 RESTRICTIONS ON ACQUISITION OF HV BANCORP, INC. 
 The following discussion is a general summary of the material provisions of HV Bancorp s articles of incorporation and bylaws, Pennsylvania corporation law and certain other regulatory provisions that may be deemed to have an anti takeover effect. The following description of certain of these provisions is necessarily general and, with respect to provisions contained in HV Bancorp s articles of incorporation and bylaws, reference should be made in each case to the document in question. 
 HV Bancorp s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 HV Bancorp articles of incorporation and bylaws contain a number of provisions relating to corporate governance and rights of stockholders that might discourage future takeover attempts. As a result, stockholders who might desire to participate in such transactions may not have an opportunity to do so. In addition, these provisions will also render the removal of the board of directors or management of HV Bancorp more difficult. 
 Directors . The board of directors is divided into three classes. The members of each class are elected for a term of three years and only one class of directors is elected annually. Thus, it would take at least two annual elections to replace a majority of our directors. The bylaws establish qualifications for board members, including: 

a prohibition on service as a director by a person who is a director, officer or a 10 stockholder of a competitor of Huntingdon Valley Bank or any other subsidiary of HV Bancorp; 

a prohibition on service as a director by a person (i) who has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or federal law, (ii) who is currently charged in an information, indictment or other complaint with the commission of or participation in such a crime, (iii) against whom a financial or securities regulatory agency has, within the past ten years, issued a cease and desist, consent, other formal order, agreement or other written statement, which is subject to public disclosure by such agency; 

a prohibition on service as a director by a person who is party to any agreement, understanding or commitment with respect to how he or she would act or vote on any issue or question before the board of directors or that would otherwise impact his or her ability to discharge his or her fiduciary duties as a director; 

a prohibition on any director who does not agree in writing to comply with all of the HV Bancorp policies applicable to directors, in addition to written confirmation that such director is qualified to serve; 

a requirement that any person proposed to serve as director have maintained his or her principal residence within 25 miles of an office of HV Bancorp or Huntingdon Valley Bank, for a period of at least one year prior to his or her appointment or election to the board of directors; 

a restriction on eligibility for election, re-election, appointment or re-appointment to the board of directors (excluding the current directors) if, at the time of such election, re-election, appointment or re-appointment, such person has reached the age of 72; however, the board of directors may waive this director qualification if the board of directors determines, by 2/3 vote, that such waiver is the best interest of HV Bancorp; and 

a prohibition on service by nominees or representatives (as defined in applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations) of another person who would not be eligible for service or of an entity the partners or controlling persons of which would not be eligible for service. 

 Further, the bylaws impose notice and information requirements in connection with the nomination by stockholders of candidates for election to the board of directors or the proposal by stockholders of business to be acted upon at an annual meeting of stockholders. Such notice and information requirements are applicable to all stockholder business proposals and nominations, and are in addition to any requirements under the federal securities laws. 
 Evaluation of Offers. The articles of incorporation of HV Bancorp provide that its board of directors, when evaluating a transaction that would or may involve a change in control of HV Bancorp (whether by purchases of its securities, merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or otherwise), may, in connection with the exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the best interests of HV Bancorp and its stockholders and in making any recommendation to the stockholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including, but not limited to: 

the social and economic effect on the present and future customers and employees, the communities in which HV Bancorp and its subsidiaries operate or are located; and 

the ability of HV Bancorp to fulfill its objectives as a financial institution holding company and on the ability of its subsidiary financial institution to fulfill the objectives of a federally insured financial institution under applicable statutes and regulations. 

 In addition, if any action is required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders relating to mergers, consolidations, a share exchange, sale of assets, voluntary dissolution and winding up then approval by at least 75 of the outstanding voting stock is generally required unless at least two-thirds of the board of directors recommends such action in which case the action will require only the affirmative vote as is required by law. If the board of directors determines that any proposed transaction should be rejected, it may take any lawful action to defeat such transaction. 
 Restrictions on Calling Special Meetings. The articles of incorporation provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called only by a majority of the total number of directors then in office, or upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all votes entitled to vote at the meeting. 
 Prohibition of Cumulative Voting. The articles of incorporation prohibit cumulative voting for the election of directors. 

Limitation of Voting Rights . The articles of incorporation provide that in no event will any person who beneficially owns more than 10 of the then-outstanding shares of common stock, be entitled or permitted to vote any of the shares of common stock held in excess of the 10 limit. The 10 limit shall not apply if, before the stockholder acquires shares in excess of the 10 limit, the acquisition is approved by 80 of the directors then in office. 
 Restrictions on Removing Directors from Office. The articles of incorporation provide that directors may be removed only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the total votes eligible to be cast by stockholders at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called expressly for such purpose. 
 Stockholder Nominations and Proposals. The bylaws provide that any stockholder desiring to make a nomination for the election of directors or a proposal for new business at an annual meeting of stockholders must submit written notice to HV Bancorp at least 110 days prior and not earlier than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the prior year s annual meeting; provided, however, t hat if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to the anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting, a stockholder s written notice shall be timely only if delivered or mailed to and received by the Secretary of HV Bancorp at the principal executive office of HV Bancorp no earlier than the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is first made and no later than the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is first made . 
 Authorized but Unissued Shares . The articles of incorporation authorize 20,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of serial preferred stock. HV Bancorp is authorized to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series subject to applicable provisions of law, and the board of directors is authorized to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of such shares. An effect of the possible issuance of preferred stock therefore may be to deter a future attempt to gain control of HV Bancorp. 
 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Except as otherwise allowed by law, any amendment to the articles of incorporation must be approved by a majority of our board of directors and also by a majority of the outstanding shares of our voting stock; provided, however, that approval by at least 75 of the outstanding voting stock is generally required to amend the following provisions if such amendment did not receive the approval of 80 of the board of directors then in office: 

(i) 
 
 the authorized amount of capital stock, the authority of the board to fix terms of preferred stock, the terms of common stock and preemptive rights; 

(ii) 
 
 the limitation on voting rights of persons who directly or indirectly beneficially own more than 10 of the outstanding shares of common stock; 

(iii) 
 
 the ability of the board of directors or a majority of the stockholders to call a special meeting; 

(iv) 
 
 the ability of stockholders to act by unanimous written consent; 

(v) 
 
 the ability of the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board; 

(vi) 
 
 the prohibition of cumulative voting and division of the board of directors into three staggered classes; 

(vii) 
 
 the liability of directors and officers; 

(viii) 
 
 the requirement that not less than two-thirds of stockholders must vote to remove directors, and can only remove directors for cause; 

(ix) 
 
 the ability of stockholders to approve certain corporate actions; 

(x) 
 
 the ability of the board of directors to evaluate certain factors in evaluating offers to purchase or otherwise acquire HV Bancorp; 

(xi) 
 
 the ability of the board of directors to amend and repeal the bylaws and the required stockholder vote to amend or repeal the bylaws; and 

(xii) 
 
 the provision of the articles of incorporation requiring approval of at least 75 of the outstanding voting stock (if 80 of the board of directors has not approved such amendment) to amend the provisions of the articles of incorporation set forth in (i) through (xi) of this list and the provisions related to amendment of the articles of incorporation. 

 The articles of incorporation also provide that the bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors that HV Bancorp would have if there were no vacancies on the board of directors or by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 75 of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors (after giving effect to the limitation on voting rights discussed above in HV Bancorp s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws Limitation of Voting Rights ). 
 Pennsylvania Corporate Law 
 Under the PBCL, a registered corporation may not engage in a business combination with an interested stockholder except for certain types of business combinations as enumerated under Pennsylvania law. The PBCL defines a business combination generally to include, with respect to a corporation, certain sales, purchases, exchanges, leases, mortgages, pledges, transfers or dispositions of assets, mergers or consolidations, certain issuances or reclassifications of securities, liquidations or dissolutions or certain loans, guarantees or financial assistance, pursuant to an agreement or understanding between such corporation or any subsidiaries, on the one hand, and uninterested stockholder or an affiliate or associate thereof, on the other hand. An interested stockholder is defined generally to include any individual, partnership, association or corporation which is the beneficial owner, as defined, of at least 20 of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation or which is an affiliate or associate of such corporation and at any time within the five-year period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of at least 20 of the outstanding voting stock. 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of an insured state savings bank or its parent holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board takes into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a state savings bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a bank holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 

Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25 of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company s directors, or a determination by the Federal Reserve Board that the acquiror has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a bank holding company s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with HV Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Federal Reserve Board regulations provide that parties seeking to rebut control will be provided an opportunity to do so in writing.
