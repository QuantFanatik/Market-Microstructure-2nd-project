BUSINESS. General The Company is a Delaware corporation which, prior to 1998, was engaged in the specialty packaging business, primarily as a supplier of packaging products to the agricultural industry. During 1997, the Company commenced an orderly liquidation of its assets which was completed in 1997. At present, management of the Company is seeking to secure a suitable merger partner wishing to go public or to acquire private companies to create investment value for the Company. For purposes of Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Company is considered a shell company. History The Company was established in July of 1993 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dawson Geophysical Company Dawson and formerly known TGC Industries, Inc.). On July 30, 1993, the Company purchased certain assets of Union Camp Corporation s packaging division for a purchase price of approximately 6.14 million. Effective July 21, 1997, the Company sold its operations and completed liquidation during 1997. Post-Liquidation Operations Since 1999, the Board of Directors has devoted its efforts to establishing a new business or engaging in a merger or other reorganization transaction. ITEM 1A.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA. Not Applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. Results of Operations For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenue The Company had no operations and no revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and its only income was from interest income on its short-term investments which are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Operating Expenses The following table presents our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Audit and professional fees 26,506 38,173 Payroll 20,638 20,582 Other general and administrative expense 12,978 12,898 60,122 71,653 Operating expenses consist mostly of audit and accounting fees and payroll. There were less operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly due to lower legal and professional fees than were incurred in 2022. Other general and administrative expenses are comprised of transfer agent and EDGAR filer services and other services. These expenses were directly related to the maintenance of the corporate entity and the preparation and filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 5 Table of Contents Loss from Operation The Company incurred a loss from operations of 60,122 and 71,653 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other Income (Expense) The following table presents our total Other Income (Expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Interest and other income 4,230 117 Warrant modification expense (1,450,890 4,230 (1,450,773 Other income (expense) decreased by (1,455,003) for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was caused by decrease in warrant modification expenses (See Note 6 on the accompanying financial statements) and less interest income in 2021 as compared to 2022 due to fewer investable funds and low interest rates. Net Loss The Company had a net loss of 55,892 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with a net loss of 1,522,426 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net loss was due to the above-mentioned effect of the warrant modification expense. Losses per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (0.00) and (0.02) per share, respectively, based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding. It is anticipated that future operating expenses will decrease and then stabilize as the Company complies with its periodic reporting requirements; however, expenses may increase as the Company works to effect a business combination, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in effecting a business combination. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2022 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 441,243, consisting of money market funds and U.S. Treasury and government securities maturing in 3 months or less. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for its business activities for at least the next twelve months and for the costs of seeking an acquisition of an operating business. The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all years presented in this Report. Cash Flow Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash used in operating activities (55,892 (73,536 Net cash provided by investing activities Net cash provided by financing activities Net cash outflow (55,892 (73,536 Net cash of 55,892 and 73,536 were used in operations during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The use of cash of 55,892 used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, principally resulted from our net loss of 55,892. 6 Table of Contents The use of cash of 73,536 used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, principally resulted from our net loss of 1,522,426, as adjusted for a non-cash charge for warrants modification expense of 1,450,890, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 2,000. No cash flows were used in or provided by investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. No cash proceeds were used in or provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to the discussion of recently adopted/issued accounting pronouncements under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Financial Statements, Note 3: Significant Accounting Policies. Factors Which May Affect Future Results Future earnings of the Company are dependent on interest rates earned on the Company s invested balances and expenses incurred.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this report, that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 7 Table of Contents Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and the dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the board of directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because of declines in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Our management, with the participation of the Principal Executive and Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Management has concluded that we did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on those criteria. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm since the Company is classified as a smaller reporting company. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, our internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. /s/ Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

The 2022 and 2021 annual effective tax rate is estimated to be a combined , respectively for the U.S. combined federal and state statutory tax rates. We review tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances and adjust them accordingly. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no tax contingencies or unrecognized tax positions recorded. F-8 Table of Contents Less valuation allowance Net deferred tax assets The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the combined U.S federal and state tax rate (25 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the following: Warrant modification expense Valuation allowance Income tax expense The Company has a net operating loss carry forward for federal and state tax purposes of approximately and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that is potentially available to offset future taxable income. The Company, had approximately in net operating losses expire in the current year. The Act changes the rules on net operating loss carry forwards. The 20-year limitation was eliminated for losses incurred after January 1, 2018, giving the taxpayer the ability to carry forward losses indefinitely. However, net operating loss carry forward arising after January 1, 2018, will now be limited to percent of taxable income. For financial reporting purposes, no deferred tax asset was recognized because at December 31, 2022 and 2021, management estimates that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the net operating losses will expire unused. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The timing and manner in which we can utilize our net operating loss carry forward and future income tax deductions in any year may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the change in ownership of corporations. Such limitation may have an impact on the ultimate realization of our carry forwards and future tax deductions. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize net operating losses if it experiences an ownership change. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change. Upon review of the ownership shifts, there has not been an ownership change as defined under Section 382. The Company had no uncertain tax positions that would necessitate recording of a tax related liability. The Company s tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are open for examination under Federal Statute of Limitations.
