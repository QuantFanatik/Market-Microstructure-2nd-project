Item 1117. Legal Proceedings. 

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association has provided the following
information: 

U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank. and other
large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed
securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar
institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and
servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees 
purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties,
notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and
abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations
under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and
it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to
the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware
statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit
in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other
institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The
National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al. , C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del.
Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result
of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans.
Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing
that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

2022 Form 10-K 6 WEPCo Environmental Trust Finance I, LLC 

U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint
in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of
the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court
ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court
entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery
concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending. 

U.S. Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has
performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the
plaintiffs claims vigorously.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

 Milwaukee, Wisconsin 

We have examined management's assertion for Wisconsin Electric Power
Company and subsidiary (the Company regarding compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB Regulation AB for the Environmental Trust Bonds Series 2021 (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding criteria items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(vi),
1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and
1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform.
The Company s management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each item
included in the Platform. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management s assertion. The nature,
timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with
the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Board of Directors 

 U.S. Bank National Association 

We have examined management s assertion,
included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association
and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities
Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services,
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this
report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed
those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated
or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although
the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there
were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to
be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be independent of the Company
and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that
the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate
Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
