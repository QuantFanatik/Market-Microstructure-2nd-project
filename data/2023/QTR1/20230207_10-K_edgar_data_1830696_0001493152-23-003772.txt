CORPORATE
HISTORY 

We
are a Company with a focus on start-up advisory and corporate consulting services, targeting start-up companies and young entrepreneurs
in the Asia-Pacific Region. 

Global
Leaders Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2020. 

On
August 25, 2020, Global Leaders Corporation, a Nevada company, acquired 100 of the equity interests of Global Leaders Corporation,
an Anguilla company GLC Anguilla ). On August 25, 2020, GLC Anguilla acquired 100 of the equity interests of Global
Leaders Academy Limited GLA ), a Hong Kong company. 

On
May 1, 2022, GLC Anguilla sold its entire 100 interest in GLA to an unrelated party due to continuing
losses incurred by GLA. 

Mr.
Peter Yip currently holds the positions of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director
of the Company, respectively. 

The
Company s principal mailing address is relocated from Unit 512, InnoCentre, 72 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong to Units
2613-18, 26/F., Shui On Centre, 6-8 Harbour Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong effective December 16, 2022. 

DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS 

We
plan to provide consultancy services to management executives of small and medium enterprises in Hong Kong. We believe clients retain
us because of our expertise and capabilities in highly specialized areas, as well as our reputation for successfully meeting our clients 
needs. 

Planned consultancy services 

Our
consultancy services will be divided into three stages: 1) Diagnosis Stage; 2) Execution of Solutions Stage; and 3) Follow-up
Stage. 

1) 
 Diagnosis
 Stage 

At
initial stage, to provide tailor-made solutions to our clients, we conduct interviews and meetings with management executives, which
can be conducted face-to-face or online. 

2) 
 Execution
 of Solutions Stage 

Upon agreement with the client, we provided
recommendations as advised in the diagnosis report. Workshops and trainings will be conducted by outsourced qualified trainers or our
staff. 

3) 
 Follow-up
 stage 

After
the completion of the workshops, we follow up with clients regularly by meeting with the participants and managements. The meetings provide
clients with guidance to identify success and failure factors on an on-going basis. 

PLAN
OF OPERATION 

Our planned operations may be hindered by factors
beyond our control, such as general market conditions, our ability to attract qualified employees, government policies relevant to our
industry, our ability to maintain our existing competitive advantages and new market entrants. 

Our
anticipated future growth will likely place significant demand on our management and operational efficiency. Our success in managing
our growth will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients and launch new
services to increase our revenue. In addition, we will adapt our existing services
to changing industry and user conditions, and expand, train and manage our employees. The market in which we operate is highly dynamic
and may not develop as expected. If we are unable to manage our operations properly and
prudently as we continue to grow in this evolving market, or if the quality of our services deteriorates due to mismanagement,
our brand name and reputation could be severely harmed, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. 

TRANSFER
AGENT AND REGISTRAR 

As
of the date of this filing, we do not have a transfer agent. 

PENNY
STOCK REGULATIONS 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets more than 1,000,000, or annual incomes
exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

DIVIDEND
POLICY 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
Board of Directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no contractual obligations or restrictions to declare
or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our Board of Directors
currently intends to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future. 

SECURITIES
AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

have not established any compensation plans under which equity securities are authorized for issuance.

under this item. 

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OVERVIEW 

Global
Leaders Corp. (the Company or we was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 20, 2020 and has a fiscal
year end of October 31. 

GOING
CONCERN 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of 109,321 and used cash in operations of 181,985, and at October
31, 2022, had a stockholders deficit of 63,459. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that its financial statements are issued. In
addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s October 31,
2022, audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
Company s financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As of October 31, 2022, the Company s cash balance was 797. In November 2022, the Company sold 668,750 restricted shares of its
common stock to eighteen individual shareholders in a private placement for total proceeds of 535,000. Notwithstanding the November
2022 equity financing, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to implement
its business plans and continue receiving financial support from its officers and shareholders. No assurance can be given that any future
financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company
is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing,
or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

USE
OF ESTIMATES 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates for the accruals of potential liabilities. 

REVENUE
RECOGNITION 

The
Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the
Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company recognizes revenue following the five-step model prescribed by
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts , which includes (1) identifying the contracts
or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Years
ended October 31, 2022 and 2021: 

We
recorded no revenues and cost of revenues for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

For
the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, general and administrative expenses were 105,905 and 529,266 and included 54,691 and 461,245
of general and administrative expenses to related parties for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For
the year ended October 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of 109,321 (including loss from continuing operations of 105,905)
and used cash in operations of 181,985, (including cash used in operations of continuing operations of 159,809) and at October 31,
2022, had a stockholders deficit of 63,459. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that its financial statements are issued. 

As
of October 31, 2022, the Company s cash balance was 797. In November 2022, the Company sold 668,750 restricted shares of its
common stock to eighteen individual shareholders in a private placement for total proceeds of 535,000.
Notwithstanding the November 2022 equity financing, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
Company s ability to implement its business plans and continue receiving financial support from its officers and shareholders.
No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that
are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue
restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of
equity financing. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As
of October 31, 2022, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.

including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when
this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and financial officer concluded as of the evaluation
date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2022 due to material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting as described below. 

MANAGEMENT S
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting
as of October 31, 2022 based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of October 31, 2022, the
Company s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. 

We
identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses identified include (i) the Company did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee and did not maintain
an independent board; (ii) the Company had inadequate segregation of duties; and (iii) the Company
had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application
of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements. 

The
material weaknesses were identified by our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, who also serves as our principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer, in connection with the review of our financial statements as of October 31, 2022. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM
10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Our
executive officer s and director s and their respective ages as of the date hereof are as follows: 

NAME 
 
 AGE 
 
 POSITION 
 
 Yip
 Hoi Hing Peter 
 
 65 
 
 President,
 Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of Board of Directors 

The
executive officer and director named above will serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until their respective resignation
or removal from office. Thereafter, directors are anticipated to be elected for one-year terms at the annual stockholders meeting.
Officers will hold their positions at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, absent any employment agreement, of which none currently
exists or is contemplated. 

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officer and director. 

Yip
Hoi Hing Peter, 65, is the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of
the Company. Mr. Yip graduated from banking in Association of Chartered Institute of Bankers London and Master of Business Administration
degree in Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Mr. Yip has held various senior positions in ABN AMRO, Standard Chartered Bank, JPMorgan
Chase and CSG Group Holdings Limited in the last 30+ years. He was the regional training manager in ABN AMRO from 1982 to 1992, spearheading
the training function in Asia Pacific region. In 1993, he took up the position of Regional Training Consultant in Standard Chartered
Bank to develop corporate bankers relationship management competencies. From 1994 to 2003, Mr. Yip was the Head of Learning 
Development, North Asia in JPMorgan Chase, specializing in organizational integration, leadership alignment, change management, culture
development, performance management and feedback management. After 20 years career in banking,
Mr. Yip started his entrepreneurship as the Founder CEO of CSG Group Holdings Limited in 2003. In the last 19 years, he has set
up a diversified business in Asia Pacific, ranging from market research, business consulting to corporate advisory. Mr. Yip brings
to the board of directors his business leadership, corporate strategy, and talent development expertise. 

TERM
OF OFFICE 

All
directors hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company and until their successors have been duly elected
and qualified. The Company s Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors will consist of no less than three members. Officers are
elected by and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

Our
Board of Directors is currently composed of one member who does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published
listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (though the Company may have a plan to list on the NASDAQ Global Market later). The
NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least
three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business
dealings with us. In addition, our Board of Directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships
exist which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the
responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our Board of Directors made
these determinations, our Board of Directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our director and us regarding
to our director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. 

CERTAIN
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

No
director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation
of his ability or integrity during the past five years. 

SIGNIFICANT
EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS 

Other
than our officers and directors, we currently have no other significant employees. 

AUDIT
COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by
such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit
committee financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such
committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only two directors, and to date, such directors
have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers
have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of
interest with any of our executive officers or directors. 

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of our equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers,
directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Specific due dates for these reports have been established and the Company is required to report in this report any failure to file by
these dates. 

8 

All
filing requirements were satisfied by the Company s Officers, Directors, and ten-percent holders. 

In
making these statements, we have relied on the written representation of our Directors and Officers or copies of the reports that they
have filed with the Commission. 

CODE
OF ETHICS 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

SHAREHOLDER
PROPOSALS 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

COMPENSATION
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

DIRECTOR
COMPENSATION 

Our
Board of Directors does not currently receive any consideration for their services as members of the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors reserves the right in the future to award the members of the Board of Directors cash or stock-based consideration for their
services to the Company, which awards, if granted shall be in the sole determination of the Board of Directors. 

EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY 

Our
Board of Directors determines the compensation given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors reserves
the right to pay our executive or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of Common Stock in consideration for services
rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s
performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance
of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance
base stock options to date, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination
believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company. 

INCENTIVE
BONUS 

The
Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the
Board of Directors believes such bonuses are in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and
growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability
of such executives. 

LONG-TERM,
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 

To
attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award our executive
and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, which
we do not currently have any immediate plans to award.

each person or entity known to our Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of the outstanding Common Stock; (ii) each officer
and director of our Company; and (iii) all officers and directors as a group. Information relating to beneficial ownership of Common
Stock by our principal shareholders and management is based upon information furnished by each person using beneficial ownership 
concepts under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of
a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment
power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any

rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial
owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole
voting and investment power.

Report

To
the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Global Leaders Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Leaders Corp. (the Company as of October 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash
flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, during the year ended October 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss and had negative cash flows
from operations, and at October 31, 2022, had a stockholders deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in relation to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that these financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As

In November 2022, the Company sold 
 restricted shares of its common stock to eighteen
individual shareholders in a private placement for total proceeds of . Notwithstanding the November 2022 equity financing,
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to implement its business plans
and continue receiving financial support from its officers and shareholders. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if
needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able
to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause
substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

accompanying consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows have been adjusted to conform to
this presentation; no adjustment has been made to the prior period consolidated balance sheet as a result of the disposal.

The
provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining
whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, based on all available
objective evidence, including the existence of cumulative losses, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets were not fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred
tax assets. The Company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence
exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740, which requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that
a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the
financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be recorded or
disclosed.
