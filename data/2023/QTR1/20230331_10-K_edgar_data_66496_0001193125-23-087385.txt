PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Organization and Background Mills Music Trust (the Trust was created by a Declaration of Trust, dated December 3, 1964 (the Declaration of Trust ), for the purpose of acquiring from Mills Music, Inc. Old Mills ), the right to receive payment of a deferred contingent purchase price obligation (the Contingent Portion payable to Old Mills. The obligation to pay the Contingent Portion arose as the result of the sale by Old Mills of its music and lyric copyright catalogue (the Catalogue to a newly formed company pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated December 5, 1964 (the Asset Purchase Agreement ). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, payment of the Contingent Portion to the Trust continues until the end of the year in which the last copyright in the Catalogue expires and cannot be renewed. The Contingent Portion amounts are currently payable by EMI Mills Music Inc. EMI ), the owner of the copyrighted materials contained in the Catalogue. The Trust has been advised that Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC Sony/ATV is the administrator and manager of EMI and the Catalogue. HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. is the Corporate Trustee of the Trust (the Corporate Trustee ), and Lee Eastman and Michael E. Reiss are the Individual Trustees of the Trust (the Individual Trustees and together with the Corporate Trustee, the Trustees ). Proceeds from Contingent Portion Payments The Trust receives quarterly payments of the Contingent Portion from EMI and distributes the amounts it receives to the registered owners of Trust Certificates (the Unit Holders representing interests in the Trust (the Trust Units ), after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The Declaration of Trust provides that these are the Trust s sole responsibilities and that the Trust is prohibited from engaging in any business activities. Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are based on royalty income which the Catalogue generates. The Trust does not own the Catalogue or any copyrights or other intellectual property rights and is not responsible for collecting royalties in connection with the Catalogue. As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust as its Contingent Portion payment obligation, in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Calculation of the Contingent Portion The amount of each payment of the Contingent Portion is based on a formula set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. For information regarding the calculation of the Contingent Portion and a related dispute between EMI and the Trust see Contingent Portion Payments under Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Cash Distributions to Unit Holders The Declaration of Trust provides for the distribution to the Unit Holders of all funds the Trust receives after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The Copyright Catalogue The Catalogue is estimated to be composed of over 12,000 music titles (the Copyrighted Songs ), of which approximately 1,430 produced royalty income in recent years. Based on information which EMI provided to the Trust, most of the royalty income generated by the Catalogue during recent years has been produced by a relatively small number of the Copyrighted Songs with copyrights established in or prior to 1960. EMI has provided the Trust with a listing (the Listing of the top 50 earning songs in the Catalogue during the 2022 calendar year (the Top 50 Songs ). The totals contained in the right most column of the Listing represent gross royalty payments EMI received for each of the Top 50 Songs, before it made deductions in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Listing also contains the following additional information for each song title: the writer(s), the original copyright date and copyright renewal date and the date on which each copyright enters the public domain in the United States.

The Listing is set forth below in the form that EMI provided to the Trust. There can be no assurance that the Listing is indicative of the future performance of the Copyrighted Songs or that EMI will be able to retain its rights to the Copyrighted Songs during their full term of copyright protection. As of the date of this report, the Trust has not undertaken an audit to confirm the accuracy of the information contained in the Listing, and there can be no assurance by the Trust that the information EMI provided in the Listing is correct.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Copyright Catalogue The Catalogue is estimated to be composed of over 12,000 music titles, of which approximately 1,430 produced royalty income in recent years. Based on the Listing, the Trust derives its receipts principally from copyrights established in or prior to 1960 in the United States. The receipts fluctuate based on consumer interest in the nostalgia appeal of older songs and the overall popularity of the songs contained in the Catalogue. The Catalogue also generates royalty income in foreign countries in which copyright is claimed. A number of factors create uncertainties with respect to the Catalogue s ability to continue to generate royalty income on a continuing, long-term basis for the Trust. These factors include: (i) the effect that foreign and domestic copyright laws and any changes thereto have or will have on renewal rights (e.g., vesting of renewal term rights), (ii) the length of the term of copyright protection under foreign and domestic copyright laws, (iii) reversionary rights that may affect whether EMI is able to retain its rights to the Copyrighted Songs during certain renewal terms (e.g., statutory termination of transfers or copyright recapture and (iv) ongoing disputes regarding the payment and calculation of the Contingent Portion. The Trust does not own the Catalogue or any copyrights or other intellectual property rights and is not responsible for collecting royalties in connection with the Catalogue. As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust in accordance with its Contingent Portion payment obligation. The Trust s income is dependent, in part, on EMI s ability to maintain its rights in the Copyrighted Songs through copyright protection. Although Copyrighted Songs may continue to generate royalty revenue after their copyrights have expired, in general as the copyrights for the Copyrighted Songs expire, less royalty income will be generated, and the size of each payment of the Contingent Portion will be reduced accordingly. Based on the Listing, most of the Top 50 Songs obtained copyright registration under the U.S. Copyright Act of 1909 (the 1909 Act between 1926 and 1958. For copyrighted works subject to the 1909 Act, copyright law generally provides for a possible 95 years of copyright protection, subject to certain factors, including the initial registration date of each copyright and compliance with certain statutory provisions including notice and renewal. The Copyright expiration dates for the Top 50 Songs range between 2021 and 2053, as set forth in the Listing. The Copyrighted Songs are subject to statutory rights of termination of transfers, which may impact whether EMI is able to retain its ownership of the Copyrighted Songs during their respective terms of copyright protection. For copyrights governed by the 1909 Act, this termination right vests at the end of two different renewal terms, which vary for each Copyrighted Song. As the owner of the Catalogue, EMI (and not the Trust) is responsible for administrating the Catalogue and seeking renewals of the Copyrighted Songs. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that EMI is obligated to use its best efforts to secure renewals. Contingent Portion Payments Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are ordinarily made on a quarterly basis, approximately two to three months after a quarter ends. The Trust distributes the amounts it receives in Contingent Portion payments to the Unit Holders after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The amount of each payment of the Contingent Portion is based on a formula provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Prior to the first quarter of 2010, the Contingent Portion was calculated as an amount ranging from 65 to 75 of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty expenses. In addition, the Contingent Portion was guaranteed to be at least a minimum of 167,500 per quarter (the Minimum Payment Obligation ). Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Asset Purchase Agreement provides for certain changes with respect to the calculation of the Contingent Portion. One such change is that the Minimum Payment Obligation is no longer in effect. The Trust is also of the view that the Contingent Portion payable to the Trust changed to a fixed 75 of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty related expenses (the New Calculation Method ). However, EMI has disputed that the New Calculation Method is the correct interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement. As a result of EMI not applying the New Calculation Method, EMI s payments of the Contingent Portion have been deficient, in the Trust s view, by the following amounts (the Underpayments ):

The Trustees and Unit Holders of Mills Music Trust 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying statements of cash receipts and disbursements of Mills Music Trust (the Trust for each of the years in the two-year

 period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with the basis of cash receipts and disbursements, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as described in Note 1 to the financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the Trust s financial statements based on our audits.

The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements.

As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust in accordance with its Contingent Portion payment obligation. 
 The Trust s income is dependent, in part, on EMI s ability to maintain its rights in the Copyrighted Songs through copyright protection. Although Copyrighted Songs may continue to generate royalty revenue after their copyrights have expired, in general as the copyrights for the Copyrighted Songs expire, less royalty income will be generated, and the size of each payment of the Contingent Portion will be reduced accordingly. 
 Based on the Listing, most of the Top Songs obtained copyright registration under the U.S. Copyright Act of 1909 (the 1909 Act) between 1926 and 1958. For copyrighted works subject to the 1909 Act, copyright law generally provides for a possible years of copyright protection, subject to certain factors, including the initial registration date of each copyright and compliance with certain statutory provisions including notice and renewal. The Copyright expiration dates for the Top 50 Songs range between and , as set forth in the Listing. 
 The Copyrighted Songs are subject to statutory rights of termination of transfers, which may impact whether EMI is able to retain its ownership of the Copyrighted Songs during their respective terms of copyright protection. For copyrights governed by the 1909 Act, this termination right vests at the end of two different renewal terms, which vary for each Copyrighted Song. As the owner of the Catalogue, EMI (and not the Trust) is responsible for administrating the Catalogue and seeking renewals of the Copyrighted Songs. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that EMI is obligated to use its best efforts to secure renewals.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Trust s management, which is comprised of the Trust Officer of the Corporate Trustee and the Chief Financial Individual providing accounting services to the Trust, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Trust s management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Trust s management concluded that the design and operation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Trust as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Trust s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements and the reliability of financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on management s assessment, the Trust believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Trust to provide only management s report in this annual report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
