TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 General 
 We are a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers that was established in 1995 through the merger of long-standing specialty contractors. Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets. Our operations are currently conducted through wholly-owned subsidiaries. We primarily provide electrical construction services through a network of local offices located throughout the United States and Canada. We provide a broad range of services, including design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services, with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 12121 Grant Street, Suite 610, Thornton, Colorado 80241. The telephone number of our principal executive offices is (303) 286-8000. 
 Reportable Segments 
 Through our subsidiaries, we are a leading specialty contractor serving the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets in the United States and Canada. We manage and report our operations through two electrical contracting service segments: Transmission and Distribution T D and Commercial and Industrial C I ). We generally focus on improving our profitability by selecting projects we believe will provide attractive margins, actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects, holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications and rewarding our employees for effectively managing costs. 
 Transmission and Distribution segment. We have operated in the transmission and distribution industry since 1891. We are one of the largest U.S. contractors servicing the T D sector of the electric utility industry. Our T D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade and maintenance and repair services, with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair, to customers in the electric utility industry throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. Our T D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations, lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems, clean energy projects and limited gas construction services. The T D segment also provides emergency restoration services in response to, wildfire, ice or other damage. 
 In our T D segment, we generally serve the electric utility industry and power generation companies as a prime contractor, through traditional design-bid-build or engineering, procurement and construction EPC forms of project delivery. We have long-standing relationships with many of our T D customers who rely on us to construct and maintain reliable electric and other utility infrastructure. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year master service agreements MSAs and other variable-term service agreements. 
 Commercial and Industrial segment. We have provided electrical contracting services for commercial and industrial construction since 1912. Our C I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting and signalization in the United States and western Canada. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise are critical to successful and timely execution. Typical C I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities and transportation control and management systems. 
 In our C I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C I industry, but also contract directly with facility owners. The C I segment has a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships. 
 Additional financial information related to our business segments is provided under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 17 Segment Information to our Financial Statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Customers 
 Our T D customers include many of the leading providers in the electric utility industry. These customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. Our C I customer base includes general contractors, commercial and industrial facility owners, governmental agencies and developers. 
 We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and we cultivate these relationships at all levels of our organization. We seek to build upon our customer relationships to secure additional projects from our current customer base. Many of our customer relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through a partnering approach, which includes project evaluation and consulting, quality performance, performance measurement and direct customer contact. At all levels of management, we maintain a focus on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. In addition, our management teams promote and market our services for prospective large-scale projects and national accounts. We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise, customer relationships, emphasis on safety and customer service contribute to obtaining new contracts with both existing and new customers. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our top 10 customers accounted for 35.4 , 34.9 , and 32.7 , of our revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0 of annual revenues. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenues derived from T D customers accounted for 58.0 , 52.1 and 51.4 of our total revenues, respectively, and revenues derived from C I customers accounted for 42.0 , 47.9 and 48.6 of our total revenues, respectively. 
 Types of Service Arrangements and Bidding Process 
 We enter into contracts principally through a competitive bid process. Our typical construction project begins with the preparation and submission of a bid to a customer. If selected as the successful bidder, we generally enter into a contract with the customer that provides for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract. Most of our contracts, including MSAs, may be terminated by our customers on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts we undertake, our contracts are primarily structured as: 
 fixed-price agreements, under which we agree to perform the defined scope for a fixed amount; 
 unit-price agreements, under which we agree to perform the work at a fixed price per unit of work as specified in the agreement; 
 time-and-equipment and time-and-materials contracts, under which we agree to perform the work at negotiated hourly billing rates for labor and equipment and for other expenses, including materials, as incurred, at rates agreed to in the contract; and 
 cost-plus contracts, where we are paid for our costs plus a negotiated margin. 
 On occasion, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts include shared savings clauses, in which the contract includes a target price and we agree to share savings from that target price with our customer. 
 Fixed-price and unit-price contracts typically have higher potential margins; however, they hold a greater risk in terms of profitability because cost overruns may not be recoverable. Time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts have less margin upside, but generally have a lower risk of cost overruns. Work in our T D segment is generally completed under fixed-price, time-and-materials, time-and-equipment, unit-price and cost-plus agreements. Work in our C I segment is typically performed under fixed-price, time-and-materials, time-and-equipment, cost-plus, and unit-price agreements. Fixed-price contracts accounted for 62.7 of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, including 47.8 of our total revenue for our T D segment and 83.3 of our total revenue for our C I segment. 
 Our EPC contracts are typically fixed-price and may be entered into through joint ventures. We may act as the prime contractor for an EPC project where we perform the procurement and construction functions but use a subcontractor to perform the engineering component, or we may use a subcontractor for both engineering and procurement functions. We may also act as a subcontractor on an EPC project to an engineering firm or general contractor. When acting as a subcontractor for an EPC project, we typically provide construction services only, although we may also perform both the construction and procurement functions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Our T D segment also provides services under MSAs that cover maintenance, upgrade and extension services, as well as new construction. Work performed under MSAs is typically billed on a unit-price, time-and-materials or time-and-equipment basis. MSAs are typically one to three years in duration. Under MSAs, customers generally agree to contract with us for certain services in a specified geographic region. A majority of our MSAs do not include obligations to assign specific volumes of work to us nor do they grant us exclusivity, although in some cases certain work under the MSA may be subject to our right of first refusal. Many of our contracts, including MSAs, are open to bidding at expiration and generally attract numerous bidders. 
 A portion of the work we perform requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds, letters of credit or other guarantees at the time of execution of the contract. Many of our contracts include retention provisions of up to 10 , which are generally withheld from each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved. 
 Materials 
 In many cases, our T D customers are responsible for supplying materials on projects; however, under certain contracts, we may agree to provide all or a portion of the required materials. For our C I contracts, we usually procure the necessary materials and supplies. We are not dependent on specific suppliers for materials or supplies. 
 Subcontracting 
 We are the prime contractor for the majority of our T D projects, however, we occasionally perform work as a subcontractor, and we may elect to do so from time to time on larger projects in order to manage our execution risk. We are a subcontractor to a general contractor for the majority of our C I projects, but may contract directly with facility owners. We may utilize subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts and to manage workflow, particularly for design and engineering under both segments. 
 We often work with subcontractors who are sole proprietorships or small business entities. Subcontractors normally provide their own employees, vehicles, tools and insurance coverages. We are not dependent on any single subcontractor. Our contracts with subcontractors often contain provisions limiting our obligation to pay the subcontractor if our client has not paid us. We hold our subcontractors responsible for their work or delays in their performance. When we perform work as a subcontractor we are often only paid after the general or prime contractor is paid. On larger projects, we may require performance and payment bonding from subcontractors, where we deem appropriate, based on the risk involved. 
 Competition 
 Our business is highly competitive in both our T D and C I segments. Competition in both of our business segments is primarily based on the price of the construction services and upon the reputation for safety, quality and reliability of the contractor. The competition we encounter can vary depending upon the type and location of construction services. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors that customers consider in our industry are: 
 price and flexible contract terms; 
 safety programs and safety performance; 
 reputation and relationships with the customer; 
 technical expertise and experience; 
 management team experience; 
 geographic presence and breadth of service offerings; 
 willingness to accept risk; 
 quality of service execution; 
 specialized equipment, tooling and centralized fleet structure; 
 the availability of qualified and licensed personnel; 
 adequate financial resources and bonding capacity; 
 technological capabilities; and 
 weather-damage restoration abilities and reputation. 
 While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, most of their work is awarded through a bid process where price is always a principal factor. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our industry is highly competitive.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 T D Competition 
 Our T D segment competes with a number of companies in the local markets where we operate, ranging from small local independent companies, to medium size regional firms, to large national competitors. 
 There are a number of barriers to entry into the transmission markets, including the cost of equipment and tooling necessary to perform transmission work, availability of qualified labor, scope of typical transmission projects and technical, managerial and supervisory skills necessary to complete the job. Larger transmission projects generally require specialized heavy duty equipment as well as strong financial resources to meet the cash flow, bonding or letter of credit requirements of these projects. These factors sometimes reduce the number of potential competitors on these projects. The number of firms that generally compete for any one significant transmission infrastructure project varies greatly depending on a number of factors, including the size of the project, its location and the bidder qualification requirements imposed upon contractors by the customer. Some of our competitors restrict their operations to one geographic area while others operate nationally and internationally. 
 Compared to the transmission markets, there are fewer significant barriers to entry into the distribution markets in which we operate. As a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise can compete for distribution projects. Instead of outsourcing, some of our T D customers also employ personnel internally to perform similar types of distribution services that we provide. 
 C I Competition 
 Our C I segment predominately competes with a number of regional or local firms and with subsidiaries of national firms. There are few significant barriers to entry in the C I markets, and there are a number of small companies that compete for C I business. The size, location and technical requirements of the project will impact which competitors we will encounter when bidding on any particular project. 
 A major competitive factor in our C I segment is the individual relationships that we have developed with general contractors who typically manage the bid process, along with the willingness to be an exclusive partner with the general contractor on pursuits requiring the complete finance, design and construction services for the project. Additionally, the equipment requirements for C I work are generally not as significant as that of T D construction. Since C I construction typically involves the purchase of materials, the financial resources to procure the required materials and equipment of a particular project may impact the competition that we encounter. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by bidding for larger and more technically complex projects, which we believe many of our smaller competitors may not be capable of executing effectively. We believe that we have a favorable competitive position in the markets that we serve, due in part to our strong operating history, strong local market share, our reputation and our relationships with our customers. 
 Project Bonding Requirements and Parent Guarantees 
 Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We are required to reimburse the surety for its expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the bond. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as our strong and long-standing relationship with our sureties, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and bonds. These bonds are typically issued at the face value of the contract awarded. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 541.5 million in original face amount of bonds outstanding for projects in our T D segment and approximately 1.43 billion for projects in our C I segment. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects for both segments was approximately 880.2 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 406.0 million in original face amount of bonds outstanding for projects in our T D segment and approximately 983.3 million for projects in our C I segment. The ability to post bonds provides us with a competitive advantage over smaller or less financially secure competitors. 
 From time to time we guarantee the obligations of our subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Additionally, from time to time we are required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of our subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under our credit facility.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Backlog 
 We refer to our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts, as backlog. We calculate backlog differently for different types of contracts. For our fixed-price contracts, we include the full remaining portion of the contract in our calculation of backlog. A customer s intention to award us work under a fixed-price contract is not included in backlog unless there is an actual award and contract to perform a specific scope of work at specific terms and pricing. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of MSAs that typically have a one- to three-year duration from execution. Given the duration of our contracts and MSAs and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue we expect to realize during any period and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to generate in the following fiscal year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Our backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Additionally, the difference between our backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the portion of our MSAs that is excluded, under certain contract types, from our remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by us or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Our estimated backlog also includes our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. Additional information related to our remaining performance obligations is provided in Note 12 Revenue Recognition to our Financial Statements. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits and may not accurately represent future revenue. 
 Certain projects that we undertake are not completed in one accounting period. Revenue on construction contracts is recognized over the contract term based on costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, we calculate the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. While our contracts typically include labor, equipment and indirect costs, the amount of subcontractor and material costs on any individual contract can vary considerably. 
 There can be no assurance as to the accuracy of our current estimates of customer requirements, existing and future needs under MSAs, or of the values of our cost or time-dependent contracts and, therefore, our current backlog may not be realized as part of our future revenues. Subject to the foregoing discussions, the following table summarizes our estimate of backlog that we believe to be firm as of the dates shown and the backlog that we reasonably estimate will not be recognized within the next twelve months: 
 Backlog at December 31, 2022 (in thousands) Total Amount estimated to not be recognized within 12 months Total backlog at December 31, 2021 T D 1,065,476 115,881 676,130 C I 1,436,351 335,935 1,113,014 Total 2,501,827 451,816 1,789,144 
 Changes in backlog from period to period are primarily the result of fluctuations in the timing of awards and revenue recognition of contracts. Our backlog as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 included our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture backlog totaling 30.8 million and 5.4 million, respectively.

We operate a fleet of trucks and trailers, support vehicles, bulldozers, bucket trucks, digger derricks, cranes and specialty construction equipment, such as wire pullers and wire tensioning machines. We also rely on specialized tooling, including stringing blocks, wire grips and presses. The standardization of our equipment allows us to streamline training, maintenance and parts costs. We operate a centralized fleet facility, as well as numerous regional maintenance shops throughout the United States, that are staffed with mechanics and equipment managers who service our fleet. Our ability to internally service our fleet allows us to reduce repair costs and the time equipment is out of service by eliminating both the need to ship equipment long distances for repair and dependence on third party maintenance providers. Our maintenance shops are also able to modify standard construction equipment to meet the specific needs of our specialty applications. We are a final-stage manufacturer for several configurations of our specialty vehicles, and, in the event that a particular piece of equipment is not available to us, we can often build the component on-site, which reduces our reliance on our equipment suppliers. 
 Our United States based fleet of equipment is managed by our centralized fleet management group. Our fleet is highly mobile, which gives us the ability to shift resources from region-to-region quickly and to effectively respond to customer needs or major weather events. Our centralized fleet management group is designed to enable us to optimize and maintain our equipment to achieve the highest equipment utilization, which helps to maintain a competitive position with respect to our equipment costs. We develop internal equipment rates that provide our business units with appropriate pricing levels to estimate their bids for new projects more accurately. The fleet management group works with our business units in prioritizing the use of our fleet assets. The fleet management group also manages the procurement and disposition of equipment and short-term rentals. All of these factors are critical in allowing us to operate efficiently and meet our customers needs. Certain equipment needs in Canada are managed by our Canadian operating subsidiaries. 
 Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including: 
 licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers; 
 regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; 
 licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; 
 building and electrical codes; 
 special bidding and procurement requirements on government projects; and 
 local laws and government acts regulating work on protected sites. 
 We believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and we believe that we have all material licenses required to conduct our operations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in project delays, cost overruns, remediation costs, substantial fines and revocation of our operating licenses. We do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. In addition, health and safety regulations may require increased operating costs or capital investments to promote a safe working environment. With respect to the laws and regulations noted above, as well as other applicable laws and regulations, the Company's compliance programs may under certain circumstances involve material investments in the form of additional processes, training, personnel, information technology and capital. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
 Environmental Matters 
 As a result of our current and past operations, we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the use, transport and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were discharged by current or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or otherwise use our properties in certain ways, such as collateral for possible financing. We could also be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations and that any obligations related to environmental matters should not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Additionally, there are significant environmental regulations under consideration to encourage the use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of greenhouse gases to address climate change. We regularly monitor the various proposals in this regard. Although the impact of climate change regulations on our business will depend on the specifics of governmental policies, legislation, and regulation, we believe that we are well-positioned to adapt our business to meet new regulations. Furthermore, we perform a significant amount of services for customers that operate electrical power infrastructure assets in locations and climates that are more susceptible to wildfires or other natural disasters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our failure to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations could result in significant liabilities and Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to risks associated with climate change including financial risks and physical risks such as an increase in extreme weather events (such as floods, wildfires or hurricanes), rising sea levels and limitations on water availability and quality." 
 Cyclical Nature of Business and Seasonality 
 The demand for construction and maintenance services from our customers is cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the industries we serve as well as the economy in general. As a result, our volume of business could be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions. 
 Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers industries, our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variation can be influenced by a number of factors such as weather, daylight hours, availability of workforce, asset readiness and holidays. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 We believe that our people are our greatest assets and the success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified and highly skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our workforce as well as our executive officers and other key personnel. We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that serve as the framework for our human capital management approach and guide the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through a number of programs, policies and initiatives, including those related to: health and safety; inclusion, diversity, and equality; employee recruitment, training and development; and compensation and benefits programs.

 We seek to attract and retain highly qualified craft employees by providing a superior work environment through our emphasis on safety, competitive compensation, and high-quality fleet of equipment. The number of individuals we employ varies significantly throughout the year, including the number of craft employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects at any particular time. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 8,500 employees, consisting of approximately 1,600 salaried employees, including executive officers, district managers, project managers, superintendents, estimators, office managers, administrative staff, clerical personnel and approximately 6,900 craft employees. Approximately 86 of our craft employees are members of unions, with the majority being members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers IBEW ), who are represented by many local unions under agreements with generally uniform terms and varying expiration dates. We generally are not direct parties to such local agreements, but instead these agreements are entered into by and between the IBEW local unions and the National Electrical Contractors Association NECA ), of which the majority of our subsidiaries are members. On occasion, we also employ individuals who are members of other trade unions pursuant to multi-employer, multi-union project agreements.

 warranty claims. 
 Accordingly, our operating results in any particular reporting period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other reporting period. 
 Our industry is highly competitive. 
 Our industry is fragmented and we compete with other companies, ranging from small, independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional, national and international markets. Any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors. Competition in the industry depends on many factors, including pricing of the construction services, the reputation for safety and the quality and reliability of the contractor. Some of our competitors may have lower labor and overhead cost structures and, therefore, may be able to provide their services at lower prices than ours. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technological and human resources than we do. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within the markets we serve or maintain our customer base at current levels. Additionally, we may face competition from in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers including electric utility companies and others which often employ personnel to internally perform some of the same types of services we do. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Negative economic and market conditions including tariffs on materials and recessionary conditions may in the future adversely impact our customers spending and, as a result, our operations and growth. 
 The demand for our services from our customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the industries we serve as well as the economy in general. Stagnant or declining economic conditions could result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and could cause our customers to outsource less work, which could adversely affect us in the future. Additionally, many of our customers finance their projects through the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a reduction in our customers spending for our services and may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels, or at all. A prolonged economic downturn or recession could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services. Material fluctuations in energy markets could also have an adverse impact on our customers spending patterns. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power industry may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers. 
 Changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy. Increases in the cost of imported raw materials or finished goods as a result of tariffs or trade policies may impact customer spending, and reductions in customer spending could lead to fewer project awards and more competition We cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions, nor can we predict the timing or strength of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or its impact on our customers markets.

 New Project and Growth Risks 
 We may be unsuccessful in generating internal growth, which could impact the projects available to the Company. 
 Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: 
 attract new customers; 
 increase the number of projects performed for existing customers; 
 hire and retain qualified personnel; 
 successfully bid new projects; 
 expand geographically; and 
 adapt the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving construction needs. 
 In addition, if our customers are constrained in their ability to obtain capital, it could reduce the number, timing or size of projects available to us. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful, or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations and grow our business. 
 Our inability to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions or joint ventures may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy and business. 
 From time to time, our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies or entry into joint ventures that complement or diversify our business. Future acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited. We may also face competition for acquisition opportunities, and other potential acquirers may offer more favorable terms or have greater financial resources available for potential acquisitions. This competition may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions, adversely impacting any accretion that might be achieved. Failure to consummate future acquisitions could negatively affect our future growth strategies. Additionally, the acquisitions we pursue may involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption of debt or burdensome regulatory requirements. 
 Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may not realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of an acquisition, and our attempts at integrating an acquired business may not be successful. Acquisitions or joint ventures may expose us to operational and financial challenges and risks, including: 
 the disruption of our ongoing business; 
 significant diversion of resources and management s attention from our existing business; 
 reductions of cash and other resources available for operations and other uses; 
 exposure to risks specific to the acquired businesses, services, or technologies to which we are not currently exposed; 
 the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business; 
 difficulties integrating new operations and personnel; 
 failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect; and 
 the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. 
 Our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired.

 Business and Operating Risks 
 Project performance issues, including those caused by third parties, or certain contractual obligations may result in additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues or the payment of penalties, including liquidated damages. 
 Many projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may occur over several years. We may encounter difficulties that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. These difficulties may be the result of delays in designs; engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party; delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery; schedule changes; delays from our customer s failure to timely obtain permits, rights-of-way or to meet other regulatory requirements; weather-related delays; delays caused by difficult worksite environments; delays caused by inefficiencies and not achieving expected labor performance and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any delay or failure by suppliers or by third-party subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric transmission lines, clean energy projects, or other facilities. We may not be able to recover the costs we incur that are caused by delays. Certain contracts have guarantee provisions regarding project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations. Delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers and adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts. Larger projects present additional performance risks due to complexity of the work and duration of the project. 
 Our customers may change or delay various elements of the project after its commencement. The design, engineering information, equipment or materials that are to be provided by the customer or other parties may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule, resulting in additional direct or indirect costs. Under these circumstances, we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to change orders or failure by others to timely deliver items, such as engineering drawings or materials. 
 We have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to, among other things, the payment terms of our contracts and change orders relating to our contracts. These types of claims occur due to, among other things, customer-caused delays or changes in project scope, both of which may result in additional cost, which may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. Additionally, if any of our customers do not proceed with the completion of projects or default on their payment obligations, or if we encounter disputes with our customers with respect to the adequacy of billing support, we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when or if they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims in the future could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, any such claims may harm our future relationships with our customers. 
 We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel. 
 Our ability to maintain our productivity and our operating results may be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain qualified personnel necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. We have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel, such as linemen, field supervisors, project managers and engineers, in certain regions. In addition, our projects are sometimes located in remote areas, which can make recruitment and deployment of our personnel challenging. During periods with large volumes of storm restoration services work, linemen are frequently recruited across geographic regions to satisfy demand. Many linemen are willing to travel to earn premium wages for such work, which from time to time makes it difficult for us to retain these workers for ongoing projects when storm conditions persist. The commencement of new, large-scale infrastructure projects or increased demand for infrastructure improvements, as well as the shrinking electric utility workforce, may reduce the pool of skilled workers available to us. Labor shortages could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. If we are unable to hire personnel with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses. 
 14 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 In addition, the success of our business depends upon the continued efforts and abilities of our employees. The relationships between our employees and our customers are important to obtaining and retaining business. We are also dependent on recruiting effective personnel for our projects. There can be no assurance that any individual employee will continue in his or her capacity for any particular period of time. Industry-wide competition for managerial talent is high. Given that level of competition, there could be situations where our overall compensation package may be viewed as less attractive as compared to our competition, and we may experience the loss of key personnel or higher costs to retain and hire key personnel. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business and relationships with our customers. 
 The timing of new contracts and termination of existing contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in our cash flows and financial results. 
 A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from project-based work that is awarded through a competitive bid process. It is generally difficult to predict the timing and geographic distribution of the projects that we will be awarded. The selection of, timing of, or failure to obtain projects, delays in awards of projects, the re-bidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets, including our fleet of construction equipment, which could lower our overall profitability and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect when, or whether, work will begin. This can present difficulty in matching workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a ready workforce and equipment that is larger than necessary, which could impact our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If an expected contract award or the related work release is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are contracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments from the customer. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earnings if such significant projects have not been replaced in the current period. 
 Many of our contracts may be canceled upon short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing contracts, resulting in a decrease in our revenue, net income and liquidity. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under MSAs. Under these agreements, our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us or is canceled. Many of our contracts, including our MSAs, are open to competitive bidding at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re-bid. 
 During the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims. 
 We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers, subcontractors or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system failure. Insurance coverage may not be available or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management s attention from our business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits and may not accurately represent future revenue. 
 Backlog is difficult to determine accurately, and companies within our industry may define backlog differently. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation, termination or scope adjustment by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, termination or scope adjustment, we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The timing of contract awards, duration of large new contracts and the mix of services, subcontracted work and material in our contracts can significantly affect backlog reporting. Given these factors and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance as to our customers requirements or our estimates of backlog. See Item 1. Business Backlog for a discussion on how we calculate backlog for our business. 
 Our insurance has limits and exclusions that may not fully indemnify us against certain claims or losses, including claims resulting from wildfires or other natural disasters and an increase in cost, or the unavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverages would increase our overall risk exposure and could disrupt our operations and reduce our profitability. 
 We maintain insurance coverages from third party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and most of our customer contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. We maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, general liability, employer s liability, workers compensation, our employee group health program, and other types of coverages, but these policies are subject to high deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of those deductibles. Insurance losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the frequency and severity of injuries, the magnitude of damage to or loss of property or the environment, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, estimates of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety programs, and as a result, our actual losses may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that our current or past insurance coverages will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all claims and liabilities to which we may be subject. 
 We generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis; therefore, deductibles and levels of insurance coverages may change in future periods. There can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverages will be renewed upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be available at reasonable and competitive rates or at the required limits. The cost of our insurance has significantly increased and may continue to increase in the future. In addition, insurers may fail, cancel our coverage, increase the cost of coverage, determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or otherwise be unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage. We may not be able to obtain certain types of insurance or incremental levels of insurance in scope or amount sufficient to cover liabilities we may incur. For example, due to the recent increase in wildfire losses and related insurance claims, insurers have reduced coverage availability and increased the cost of insurance coverage for such events in recent years, and our current levels of coverage may not be sufficient to cover potential losses. If our risk exposure increases as a result of adverse changes in our insurance coverages, we could be subject to increased liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 In addition, we perform work in hazardous environments and our employees are exposed to a number of hazards. Incidents can occur, regardless of fault, that may be catastrophic and adversely impact our employees and third parties by causing serious personal injury, loss of life, damage to property or the environment, and interruption of operations. Furthermore, we perform a significant amount of services for customers that operate electrical power infrastructure assets in locations and climates that are more susceptible to wildfires or other natural disasters. In locations or environments where claims have become more frequent or severe in recent years, insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain. Our contracts may require us to indemnify our customers, project owners and other parties for injury, damage or loss arising out of our presence at our customers location, or in the performance of our work, in both cases regardless of fault, and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer and others as an additional insured under our insurance policies. We maintain limited insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with our business. This insurance may not protect us against liability for certain events, and we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur. Any future damages caused by our services that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 Risks associated with operating in the Canadian market could impact our profitability. 
 There are numerous inherent risks in conducting our business in a different country including, but not limited to, potential instability in markets, political, economic or social conditions, and difficult or additional legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations. Limits on our ability to repatriate earnings, exchange controls, and complex U.S. and Canadian laws and treaties including laws related to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar laws could also adversely impact our operations. Changes in the value of the Canadian dollar could increase or decrease the U.S. dollar value of our profits earned or assets held in Canada or potentially limit our ability to reinvest earnings from our operations in Canada to fund the financing requirements of our operations in the United States. These risks could restrict our ability to provide services to Canadian customers or to operate our Canadian business profitably, and could negatively impact our results. We also are exposed to currency risks relating to the translation of certain monetary transactions, assets and liabilities. 
 Changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws could materially impact our income tax liabilities. 
 We have operations in the United States and Canada and are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple federal and state taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on different bases which are subject to change by the taxing authorities. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax laws, could materially impact our income tax liabilities The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022, and includes a number of provisions that may impact the Company, including a corporate alternative minimum tax on certain large corporations, incentives to address climate change mitigation and other non-income tax provisions, including an excise tax on the repurchase of our stock. We are assessing these impacts on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The nature of our business exposes us to potential liability for warranty claims and faulty engineering, which may reduce our profitability. 
 Our customer contracts typically include a warranty for the services that we provide against certain defects in workmanship and material. Additionally, materials used in construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects from the supplier. Certain projects have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that may be broader than the warranties we generally provide. If warranty claims occurred, it could require us to re-perform the services or to repair or replace the warranted item, at a cost to us, and could also result in other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition, we may be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide that we purchase from third parties. While we generally require suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to the customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not reimbursed. Costs incurred because of warranty claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of electric power transmission and commercial construction. Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. A significantly adverse or catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant warranty, professional liability, or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. In addition, customers, subcontractors or suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured or underinsured claim could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Pandemic outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our business, employees, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Future pandemic outbreaks of disease may further disrupt global supply chains and create significant additional volatility and disruption of financial markets, which may require us to make changes to our business and, implement new health and safety protocols. Any such future health outbreaks could result in higher operating costs and could adversely impact our business, including certain operational, reporting, accounting or other processes. In addition, an extended period of remote work arrangements could impair our ability to effectively manage our business, and introduce additional operational risks, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to security breaches, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, or other similar events and intrusions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic outbreak of disease, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such effects may be material and the potential impacts include, but are not limited to: 
 disruptions in our supply chain due to transportation delays, travel restrictions, raw material cost increases and shortages, and closures of businesses or facilities; 
 reductions in our operating effectiveness due to workforce disruptions resulting from shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, and the unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; and 
 volatility in the global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital and additional sources of financing in the future. 
 Should a future health outbreak persist for a prolonged period, any of the above factors and others that are unknown, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic outbreak of disease will have on our customers and suppliers, and any adverse impacts on these parties may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 Third Party Partner Risks 
 Our dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations. 
 On certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, subcontractor or equipment manufacturer, any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations. The risk of a lack of available suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers may be heightened as a result of market and economic conditions. We may experience difficulties in acquiring equipment or materials due to supply chain interruptions, including as a result of natural disasters, weather, labor disputes, pandemic outbreak of disease, fire or explosions and power outages. To the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, we could experience losses in the performance of our operations. Successful completion of our contracts may depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, or if our subcontractors fail to meet the expected completion dates or quality standards, we may be required to incur additional costs or provide additional services in order to make up such shortfall and we may suffer damage to our reputation. 
 Our participation in joint ventures and other projects with third parties may expose us to liability for failures of our partners. 
 We may enter into joint venture or other strategic arrangements with other parties as part of our business operations. Success on a jointly performed project depends in large part on whether all parties satisfy their contractual obligations. Joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of the joint venture. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities relating to claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate or agreed upon share of a liability to compensate for the partner s shortfall. In addition, if we are unable to adequately address our partner s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, reduce our profit on the project or damage our reputation. 
 Regulatory and Environmental Risks 
 Legislative or regulatory actions relating to electricity transmission and clean energy may impact demand for our services. 
 Current and future legislative or regulatory actions may impact demand for our services, require utilities to meet reliability standards, and encourage installation of new electric transmission and clean energy generation facilities. However, it is unclear whether these initiatives will create sufficient incentives for projects or result in increased demand for our services. 
 Because most of our T D revenue is derived from the electric utility industry, regulatory and environmental requirements affecting that industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Customers in the electric utility industry we serve face stringent regulatory and environmental requirements, as well as permitting processes, as they implement plans for their projects, which may result in delays, reductions and cancellations of some of their projects. These regulatory factors have resulted in decreased demand for our services in the past, and they may do so in the future, potentially impacting our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels, or at all.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 In addition, while many states have mandates in place that require specified percentages of electricity to be generated from clean energy sources, states could reduce those mandates or make them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate clean energy development in the affected states. Additionally, clean energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup. The locations of clean energy projects are often remote and may not be viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for clean energy initiatives may not be available. These factors could result in fewer clean energy projects and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, which could negatively impact our business. 
 We may incur liabilities and suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters, including those related to environmental hazards such as wildfires and other natural disasters. 
 Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Our business is subject to numerous safety risks, including electrocutions, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, weather-related incidents, transportation accidents and damage to equipment. Furthermore, we perform a significant amount of services for customers that operate electrical power infrastructure assets in locations and climates that are more susceptible to wildfires or other natural disasters. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations, large monetary claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. Members of our workforce have suffered serious injuries or fatalities in the past and may suffer additional serious injuries or fatalities in the future. Monetary claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In addition, we have in the past, and we may in the future, be subject to criminal penalties relating to occupational health and safety violations, which have resulted in and could in the future result in, substantial costs and liabilities. Any of the foregoing could result in financial loss, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our customers seek to minimize safety risks on their sites, and they frequently review the safety records of outside contractors during the bidding process. If our safety record were to substantially deteriorate, we could become ineligible to bid on certain work, and our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business. 
 Our failure to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations could result in significant liabilities. 
 Our past, current and future operations are subject to numerous environmental and other laws and regulations governing our operations, including the use, transport and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were discharged by current or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or otherwise use our properties in ways such as collateral for possible financing. We could also be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new permitting or cleanup requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties (including our predecessor owners or lessors) for some or all of such cleanup and other obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs. 
 Legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions could result in a variety of regulatory programs, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. Any of these actions could result in increased costs associated with our operations and impact the prices we charge our customers. If new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks, we could experience a significant increase in environmental compliance costs due to our large fleet. In addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We are also subject to laws and regulations protecting endangered species, artifacts and archaeological sites. We may incur work stoppages to avoid violating these laws and regulations, or we may risk fines or other sanctions for accidentally or willfully violating these laws and regulations. We are also subject to immigration laws and regulations, for which noncompliance could be material and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Furthermore, failure to obtain permitting, right-of-way access and other tactical considerations prior to the commencement of work could delay the commencement of work on projects or cause modifications of work plans, potentially resulting in lower margins. We generally plan for certain up-front time and other costs to obtain required permitting and right-of-way access and for other tactical challenges prior to the commencement of work on our projects. Delays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, permits or right-of-way access, could negatively impact our margins due to additional cost and unabsorbed overhead resulting from under-utilized personnel and equipment. Additionally, we may encounter unexpected tactical issues on the site which could lead to unanticipated costs and delays, which we may not be able to recover from our customers. 
 Our business may be affected by seasonal and other variations, including severe weather conditions and the nature of our work environment. 
 Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers industries, our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations, particularly in our T D segment. These variations are influenced by weather, hours of daylight, customer spending patterns, available system outages from utilities and holidays, and can have a significant impact on our gross margins. Our profitability may decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods may be restricted and more costly to complete. Additionally, our T D customers often cannot remove their T D lines from service during the summer months when consumer demand for electricity is at its peak, delaying the demand for our maintenance and repair services. Furthermore, our work is performed under a variety of conditions, including but not limited to, difficult terrain, difficult site conditions and large urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted and sites which may have been exposed to harsh and hazardous conditions. Working capital needs are also influenced by the seasonality of our business. 
 Opportunities associated with government contracts could lead to increased governmental regulation applicable to us. 
 Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. If we were to be successful in being awarded government contracts, significant costs could be incurred by us before any revenues were realized from these contracts. Government agencies may review a contractor s performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If government agencies determine through these reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs. If government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. Government contracts are also subject to renegotiation of profit and termination by the government prior to the expiration of the term. 
 We are subject to risks associated with climate change including financial risks and physical risks such as an increase in extreme weather events (such as floods, wildfires or hurricanes), rising sea levels and limitations on water availability and quality. 
 Climate change may create physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change could, among other things, include an increase in extreme weather events (such as floods, wildfires or hurricanes), rising sea levels and limitations on water availability and quality. Such extreme weather conditions may limit the availability of resources, increasing the costs of our projects, or may cause projects to be delayed or cancelled. Certain risks associated with climate change could include but are not limited to: 
 changes in insurance coverage, availability of coverage, availability of adequate insurance limits, higher insurance premiums, and larger self-insured retentions/deductibles, 
 changes in market demand based on climate change as well as legal and regulatory requirements and trends, 
 operational disruptions and accompanying project inefficiencies and delays that may not be recoverable from clients due to severe weather events, 
 damage from severe weather events to construction work in progress, 
 damage to our assets from severe weather events, 
 reputational risk due to perceptions of the company s sustainability efforts, and 
 increased reporting and compliance costs due to new regulatory requirements, customer, shareholder, and stakeholder requests targeting climate change.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Additionally, legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change and new interpretations of existing laws through climate change litigation may also negatively impact our operations. The cost of additional environmental regulatory requirements could impact the availability of goods and increase our costs. International treaties or accords could also have an impact on our business to the extent they lead to future governmental regulations. Compliance with any new laws or regulations regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases could result in significant changes to our operations and a significant increase in our cost of conducting business. 
 From time to time, we establish strategies and expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory, and other standards, processes, and assumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments, increased costs, the availability of requisite financing, and changes in carbon markets. Failures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation. 
 Accounting Risks 
 Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recognized revenues and profits. 
 A significant portion of our revenues is recognized over the contract term based on costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method. This method is used because management believes costs incurred best represent the amount of work completed and remaining on our projects and is the most common basis for computing percentage of completion in our industry. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. In addition, we record adjustments to estimated costs of contracts when we believe the change in estimate is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results from Operations Critical Accounting Policies and in the notes to our Financial Statements, for a discussion on how percentage-of-completion accounting impacts our business. 
 Our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. 
 In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events. These estimates and assumptions cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. 
 The most significant estimates we use are related to costs to complete contracts, pending change orders and claims, shared savings, insurance reserves, income tax reserves, estimates surrounding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related contingent earn-out consideration liabilities, the recoverability of goodwill and intangibles, and accounts receivable reserves. 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by impairments to goodwill, other intangible assets, receivables, long-lived assets or investments. For example, when we acquire a business, we record goodwill in an amount equal to the amount we paid for the business minus the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets of the acquired business. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment. For additional description on this impairment testing, please read Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Goodwill and Intangibles . Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets or investments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Pricing and Cost Risks 
 Our actual costs may be greater than expected in performing our fixed-price and unit-price contracts. 
 We generate a significant portion of our revenues and profits under fixed-price and unit-price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project when we bid for these types of contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated and we may not be successful in recouping additional costs from our customers. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed-price and unit-price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects due to changes in a variety of factors such as: 
 failure to properly estimate costs of engineering, material, equipment or labor; 
 inefficient labor performance; 
 unanticipated technical problems with the materials or services being supplied by us, which may require us to incur additional costs to remedy the problem; 
 project modifications that create unanticipated costs; 
 changes in the costs or availability of equipment, materials, labor or subcontractors; 
 the failure of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform; 
 difficulties in our customers obtaining required governmental permits or approvals; 
 site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid; 
 the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; 
 an increase in the cost of fuel or other resources; 
 changes in local laws and regulations; 
 delays caused by local weather conditions, third parties or customers; and 
 quality issues requiring rework. 
 An increase in the cost or availability for items such as materials, parts, commodities, equipment and tooling may also be impacted by trade regulations, tariffs, global relations, taxes, transportation costs and inflation which could adversely affect our business. 
 For certain contracts, we are exposed to market risks that may cause increases in the cost, or the availability of, parts, commodities, equipment and tooling, utilized in our operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays and cost volatility of these items due to recent supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, tariffs, regulatory slowdowns and the continued market disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our customers capital budgets may be impacted by cost increases and reduced customer spending could lead to fewer project awards and more competition. These costs could be materially impacted by general market conditions and other factors, including U.S. trade relationships with other countries or the imposition of tariffs. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, particularly as they relate to fuel prices for our fleet vehicles. While we believe we can increase our prices to adjust for cost increases, there can be no assurance that future cost increases would be recoverable. Additionally, some of our fixed price contracts do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in the cost of parts, commodities, equipment and tooling or fuel costs could reduce our profitability with respect to such projects and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows 
 Capital and Credit Risks 
 We may not be able to compete for, or work on, certain projects if we are not able to obtain necessary bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances. 
 Many of our contracts require that we provide security to our customers for the performance of their projects in the form of bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances. Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers and lenders to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work and could increase our costs associated with collateral. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, letters of credit or guarantees, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders, finding more business that does not require bonds or allows for other forms of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances. 
 22 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We have also granted security interests in various assets to collateralize our obligations to our sureties and lenders. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding. 
 Employee Risks 
 Work stoppages or other labor issues with our unionized workforce could adversely affect our business, and we may be subject to unionization attempts. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 86 of our craft labor employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although most of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business, resulting in decreased revenues. From time to time, we have experienced attempts to unionize our nonunion businesses. Such efforts often delay work and present the risk of labor unrest. If nonunion employees were to unionize, we could experience higher ongoing labor costs. 
 Multi-employer pension plan obligations related to our unionized workforce could adversely impact our earnings. 
 Our collective bargaining agreements may require us to participate with other companies in various multi-employer pension plans. To the extent that we participate in any multi-employer pension plans that are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we were to withdraw from them, if they were terminated or experience a mass withdrawal. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended, imposes additional funding and operational rules applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer pension plans that are classified as either endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status, which may require additional employer contributions and/or modifications to employee benefits based on future union wages paid. 
 Although we are not currently aware of any potential significant liabilities to us as a result of these plans being classified as being in a critical or endangered status, our future financial results could be impacted by the amended funding rules. 
 Cybersecurity and Information Technology Risks 
 We rely on information, communications and data systems in our operations and we or our business partners may be subject to failures, interruptions or breaches of such systems, which could affect our operations or our competitive position, expose sensitive information or damage our reputation. 
 We and our business partners are heavily reliant on information and communications technology and related systems to conduct our business. We also rely on third-party software and information technology to run certain of our critical accounting, project management and financial information systems. Furthermore, in connection with our business we may collect and retain personally identifiable and other sensitive information of our customers and personnel, all of which expect that we will adequately protect such information. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays and reduce the efficiency of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and significant costs could be incurred to remediate any problem. 
 Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crimes, including advanced persistent threats, computer viruses, ransomware, other types of malicious code, hacking, phishing and social engineering schemes designed to provide access to our networks or data, pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of sensitive information, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations, be subject to government enforcement actions, litigation, and reputational, competitive and business harm which may adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, competitive position and reputation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to comply with new cyber-related regulations, continue to enhance our information security measures or investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. This could also impact the cost and availability of cyber insurance to us. Additionally, due to recent increases in cyber losses by the insurance industry, cyber insurance coverage may be limited and/or subject to a significant increase in cost. Furthermore, our relationships with, and access provided to, third parties and their vendors may create difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or mitigating harms after an attack or breach occurs. 
 During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information and communications technology and related systems. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. If a material, actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers. Any such material disruptions or breaches of security would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, current and future laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information may pose complex compliance challenges and/or result in additional costs. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or fines, legal liabilities and/or harm our reputation. The continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has also resulted in increased regulatory focus on risk management and prevention. New cyber-related regulations or other requirements could cause us to incur significant costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 None. 
 
 Item 2. Properties 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 12121 Grant Street, Suite 610, Thornton, Colorado 80241, the lease term of which expires on November 30, 2029. In addition to our executive offices, certain legal, accounting and other personnel are located in this building. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 18 operating facilities and leased many other properties in various locations throughout our service territories. Most of our properties are used as operational offices or for fleet operations. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operating needs. We do not believe that any owned or leased facility is material to our operations and, if necessary, we could obtain replacement facilities for our leased facilities. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 We are, from time to time, party to lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, punitive damages, civil and criminal penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 We are routinely subject to other civil claims, litigation and arbitration, and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of our past and present businesses as well as in respect of our divested businesses. Some of these include claims related to our services and operations, and we believe that we have strong defenses to these claims as well as insurance coverage that will contribute to any settlement or liability in the event these claims are not resolved in our favor. These claims have not had a material impact on us to date, and we believe the likelihood that a future material adverse outcome will result from these claims is remote. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future, we cannot be certain that an adverse outcome of one or more of these claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Overview-Introduction 
 We are a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers that was established in 1995 through the merger of long-standing specialty contractors. Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets. We manage and report our operations through two electrical contracting service segments: Transmission and Distribution T D and Commercial and Industrial C I ). 
 We have operated in the transmission and distribution industry since 1891. We are one of the largest U.S. contractors servicing the T D sector of the electric utility industry and provide T D services throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. Our T D customers include many of the leading companies in the electric utility industry. We have provided electrical contracting services for commercial and industrial construction since 1912. Our C I segment provides services in the United States and in western Canada. Our C I customers include facility owners and general contractors. 
 We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages in both of our segments, including our skilled workforce, extensive centralized fleet, proven safety performance and reputation for timely completion of quality work that allows us to compete favorably in our markets. In addition, we believe that we are better capitalized than some of our competitors, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and more complex projects. 
 We had revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 3.01 billion compared to 2.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net income was 83.4 million compared to 85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Overview-Segments 
 Transmission and Distribution segment . Our T D segment provides comprehensive solutions to providers in the electric utility industry. Our T D segment generally serves the electric utility industry as a prime contractor to customers such as investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. We have long-standing relationships with many of our T D customers who rely on us to construct and maintain reliable electric and other utility infrastructure. Our T D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities and clean energy projects, which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade and maintenance and repair services. Our T D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations, lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems, clean energy facilities and limited gas construction services. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year master service agreements MSAs and other variable-term service agreements. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our T D revenues were 1.75 billion, or 58.0 , of our revenue, compared to 1.30 billion, or 52.1 , of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 1.15 billion, or 51.4 , of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues from transmission projects represented 62.1 , 62.0 , and 64.6 of T D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Our T D segment also provides restoration services in response to hurricanes, ice storms or other storm related events, which accounted for less than 5 of our annual revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 27 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Measured by revenues in our T D segment, we provided 47.8 , 43.0 and 44.0 of our T D services under fixed-price contracts during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Commercial and Industrial segment . Our C I segment provides a wide range of services including design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting and signalization. In our C I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C I industry as well as directly to facility owners. We have a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise are critical to successful and timely execution. The majority of C I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities and transportation control and management systems. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our C I revenues were 1.26 billion, or 42.0 , of our revenue, compared to 1.20 billion, or 47.9 , of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 1.09 billion, or 48.6 , of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Measured by revenues in our C I segment, we provided 83.3 , 80.5 and 82.7 of our services under fixed-price contracts for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Overview-Revenue and Gross Margins 
 Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services provided. Revenue associated with contracts with customers is recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances customer controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. To determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, we utilize the cost-to-cost method as we believe cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on our projects, and is the most common basis for computing percentage of completion in our industry. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, we calculate the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Additionally, contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. 
 Gross Margins. Our gross margin can vary between periods as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: the mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve, the size and duration of our projects, the mix of business conducted in different parts of the United States and Canada, the mix of service and maintenance work compared to new construction work, the amount of work that we subcontract, the amount of material we supply, changes in labor, equipment or insurance costs, seasonal weather patterns, changes in fleet utilization, pricing pressures due to competition, efficiency of work performance, fluctuations in commodity prices of materials, delays in the timing of projects and other factors. The gross margins we record in the current period may not be indicative of margins in future periods. 
 
 Overview-Economic, Industry and Market Factors 
 We operate in competitive markets, which can result in pricing pressures for the services we provide. Work is often awarded through a bidding and selection process, where price is always a principal factor. We generally focus on managing our profitability by: selecting projects that we believe will provide attractive margins; actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects; holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications and rewarding our employees for controlling costs. 
 28 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The demand for construction and maintenance services from our customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the markets we serve as well as the economy in general. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period, and regional and national economic conditions in the United States and Canada may materially affect results. Project schedules, particularly in connection with larger, multi-year projects, can also create fluctuations in our revenues. Other market and industry factors, such as changes to our customers capital spending plans or delays in regulatory approvals can affect project schedules. Changes in technology, tax and other incentives and new or changing regulatory requirements affecting the industries we serve can impact demand for our services. While we actively monitor economic, industry and market factors affecting our business, we cannot predict the impact such factors may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. As a result of economic, industry and market factors, our operating results in any particular period or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period or for any other year. 
 
 Overview-Seasonality and Nature of Our Work Environment 
 Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers industries, our revenues and results of operations, particularly those derived from our T D segment, can be subject to seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather, daylight hours, availability of system outages from utilities, and holidays. During the winter months, demand for our T D work may be high, but our work can be delayed due to inclement weather. During the summer months, the demand for our T D work may be affected by fewer available system outages, due to peak electrical demands caused by warmer weather, which limits our ability to perform electrical line service work. During the spring and fall months, the demand for our T D work may increase due to improved weather conditions and system availability; however, extended periods of rain and other severe weather can affect the deployment of our crews and efficiency of operations. Furthermore, our work is performed under a variety of conditions in different locations, including but not limited to, difficult terrain, sites which may have been exposed to harsh and hazardous conditions, and in large urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted. 
 We also provide storm restoration services to our T D customers. These services tend to have a higher profit margin. However, storm restoration service work that is performed under an MSA typically has similar rates to other work under the agreement. In addition, deploying employees on storm restoration work may, at times, delay work on other transmission and distribution work. Storm restoration service work is unpredictable and can affect results of operations. 
 
 Outlook 
 Our business is directly impacted by the level of spending on T D infrastructure and the level of C I electrical construction activity across the United States and Canada. We are optimistic about infrastructure spending and believe that industry activity will continue in both our transmission and distribution market segments and the drivers for utility investment will remain intact. We believe that regulatory reform, state clean energy portfolio standards, the aging of the electric grid, and potential overall improvement of the economy will positively impact the level of spending by our customers in all of the markets we serve. Although competition remains strong, we see these trends as positive factors for us in the future. 
 We believe legislative actions aimed at supporting infrastructure improvements in the United States may positively impact long-term demand, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure, transportation and clean energy spending. We believe the legislative actions are likely to provide greater long-term opportunity in both of our reporting segments. However both of our segments and supporting operations may be subject to delays and cost volatility due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, tariffs and regulatory slowdowns which may result in decelerations in project opportunities and awards. 
 We believe there is an ongoing need for utilities to sustain investment in their transmission systems to improve reliability, reduce congestion and connect to new clean energy sources. Consequently, we believe we will continue to see significant bidding activity on large transmission projects going forward. The timing of multi-year transmission project awards and substantial construction activity is difficult to predict due to regulatory requirements and the permitting needed to commence construction. Significant construction on any large, multi-year projects awarded in 2023 will not likely have a large impact on our 2023 results. Bidding and construction activity for small to medium-size transmission projects and upgrades remain active, and we expect this trend to continue. 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 As a result of reduced spending by United States utilities on their distribution systems for several years, we believe there is a need for sustained investment by utilities on their distribution systems to properly maintain or meet reliability requirements. In 2022, we continued to see increased bidding activity in some of our electric distribution markets, as economic conditions improved in those areas. We believe the increased storm activity and destruction caused by wildfires will cause a push to strengthen utility distribution systems against catastrophic damage. Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers in the electric utility industry to seek outsourcing partners rather than performing projects internally. These trends include an aging electric utility workforce, increasing costs and staffing constraints. We believe electric utility employee retirements could increase with further economic recovery, which may result in an increase in outsourcing opportunities. 
 Our C I bidding opportunities could be impacted by market disruptions, and as a result, the growth of our C I market will be heavily dependent on the timing and pace of the overall market recovery. We believe that the primary markets we serve, such as health care, transportation, data centers, warehousing, clean energy and water/waste-water projects, may be somewhat less vulnerable to economic slowing. 
 In addition, the United States has experienced decades of underfunded economic expansion and aging infrastructure which has challenged the capacity of public water and transportation infrastructure forcing states and municipalities to seek creative means to fund needed expansion and repair. We believe the need for expanding public infrastructure will offer opportunity in our C I segment for several years. We expect the long-term growth in our C I segment to generally track the overall growth of the regions we serve. 
 We strive to maintain our status as a preferred provider to our T D and C I customers. We continued to implement strategies that further expand our capabilities and effectively allocate capital. We have focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing our variable rate outstanding debt in the current higher interest rate environment, which has increased our liquidity and allows us to take advantage of future opportunities as they arise. Additionally, on January 4, 2022, we acquired all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Powerline Plus Ltd. and its affiliate (collectively, the Powerline Plus Companies"), which expanded our distribution operations in Ontario, Canada. During 2022, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under repurchase programs at a weighted-average price of per share. As of December 31, 2022, we had million of remaining availability to purchase shares under our current program, which continues in effect until May 8, 2023, or until the authorized funds are exhausted. 
 We continue to manage our increasing operating costs, including increasing insurance, equipment, labor and material costs. We believe that our financial position, positive cash flows and other operational strengths will enable us to manage our markets and give us the flexibility to successfully execute our strategies. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T D and C I markets and in procuring the specific specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. In 2022 and 2021, we invested in capital expenditures of approximately 77.1 million and 52.4 million, respectively. Most of our capital expenditures supported opportunities in our T D business. We plan to continue to evaluate our needs for additional equipment and tooling. 
 
 Understanding Backlog 
 We define backlog as our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts. Backlog may not accurately represent the revenues that we expect to realize during any particular period. Several factors, such as the timing of contract awards, the type and duration of contracts, and the mix of subcontractor and material costs in our projects, can impact our backlog at any point in time. Some of our revenue does not appear in our periodic backlog reporting because the award of the project, as well as the execution of the work, can all take place within the period. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of MSAs that typically have a one- to three-year duration from execution. Additionally, the difference between our backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the exclusion of a portion of our MSAs under certain contract types from our remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by us or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Our backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Our estimated backlog also includes our proportionate share of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts. 
 Changes in backlog from period to period are primarily the result of fluctuations in the timing of awards and revenue recognition of contracts. Backlog should not be relied upon as a stand-alone indicator of future events.

 Understanding Gross Margins 
 Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting contract costs from revenue. Contract costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various factors affect our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis, including those listed below. 
 Performance Risk. Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be impacted both favorably and negatively by customer decisions and crew productivity, as well as other factors. When comparing a service contract between periods, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed, the availability of labor resources at expected labor rates and the productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors including the experience level of the crew, whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way, weather conditions, geographical conditions, trade stacking, performance of other sub-trades, schedule changes, effects of environmental restrictions, equipment availability and regulatory and permitting delays. 
 Revenue Mix and Contract Terms. The mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve will impact gross margins. Changes in our customers spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenue by industry served. Storm restoration services typically command higher profit margins than other maintenance services. Seasonal and weather factors, as noted below, can impact the timing at which customers perform maintenance and repairs, which can cause a shift in the revenue mix. Some of our time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts include shared savings clauses, in which the contract includes a target price and we agree to share savings from that target price with our customer. Additionally, new construction work has a higher gross margin than maintenance and repair work. New construction work is often obtained on a fixed-price basis, which carries a higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements because a contractor can bear the risk of increased expenses. As such, we generally bid fixed-price contracts with higher profit margins. We typically derive approximately 25 to 45 of our revenue from maintenance and repair work that is performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements which generally allow us a set margin above our costs. Thus, the mix between new construction work, at fixed-price, and maintenance and repair work, at cost-plus, in a given period will impact gross margin in that period. The timing of accounting recognition of such savings can impact our margins. In addition, change orders and claims can impact our margins. Costs related to change orders and claims are recognized in contract costs when incurred, but revenue related to change orders is only recognized when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated, whereas revenue related to claims is recognized only to the extent that contract costs related to the claim have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in an addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. Generally, no profit is recognized on a claim until final settlement occurs. 
 Seasonal, Weather and Geographical. Seasonal patterns, primarily related to weather conditions and the availability of system outages, can have a significant impact on gross margins in a given period. It is typical during the winter months that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall, which can affect our crews ability to work efficiently. Additionally, our T D customers often cannot remove their T D lines from service during the summer months, when consumer demand for electricity is at its peak, delaying maintenance and repair services. In both cases, projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are moderate, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on gross margins. The mix of business conducted in different parts of the country could also affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the location where the work is being performed. Such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting; in a mountainous area or in open terrain; or in normal soil conditions or rocky terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. We include depreciation on equipment and finance lease amortization in contract costs. This is common practice in our industry, but can make comparability to other companies difficult. We spend a significant amount of capital on property, facilities and equipment, with the majority of such expenditures being used to purchase additional specialized equipment to enhance our fleet and to reduce our reliance on lease arrangements and short term equipment rentals. We believe the investment in specialized equipment helps to reduce our costs, improve our margins and provide us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. 
 31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Material and Subcontract Costs. Projects that include a greater amount of material or subcontractor costs can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add a lower mark-up to material and subcontractor costs in our bids than what we would to our labor and equipment cost. In addition, successful completion of our contracts may depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, we may be required to incur additional costs and provide additional services in order to make up for such shortfalls. Additionally, we are required to allocate more working capital to projects when we are required to provide materials. 
 Insurance. Gross margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals related to our deductibles and loss history in the period in which such adjustments are made. We carry insurance policies, which are subject to high deductibles, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. 
 Fleet Availability, Cost, Utilization, Estimation, and Bidding. We operate a centrally-managed fleet in the United States in an effort to control rising costs and achieve efficient equipment utilization. We also develop internal equipment rates which provide our business units with appropriate cost information to estimate bids for new projects. Availability of equipment for a particular contract is determined by our internal fleet ordering process which is designed to optimize the use of internal fleet assets and allocate equipment costs to individual contracts. We believe these processes allow us to utilize our equipment efficiently, which leads to improved gross margins. Transmission and distribution projects can require different types of equipment. A significant shift in project mix or timing could impact fleet utilization, causing gross margins to vary. 
 Cost of Material. On fixed-price contracts where we are required to provide materials, our overall gross margin may be affected if we experience increases in the quantity or costs of materials. Projects that include a greater amount of material cost can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add a lower mark-up to material cost in our bids than what we would add to our labor and equipment cost. 
 Our team of trained estimators helps us to determine potential costs and revenues and make informed decisions on whether to bid for a project and, if bid, the rates to use in estimating the costs for that bid. The ability to accurately estimate labor, equipment, subcontracting and material costs in connection with a new project may affect the gross margins achieved for the project. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A consist primarily of compensation, related benefits and employee costs for management and administrative personnel, office rent and utilities, stock compensation, communications, professional fees, depreciation, IT expenses, marketing costs and bad debt expense.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 For the year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Contract revenues 3,008,542 100.0 2,498,289 100.0 Contract costs 2,664,580 88.6 2,173,308 87.0 Gross profit 343,962 11.4 324,981 13.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 222,424 7.4 207,208 8.3 Amortization of intangible assets 9,009 0.3 2,311 0.1 Gain on sale of property and equipment (2,378) (0.1) (3,098) (0.1) Income from operations 114,907 3.8 118,560 4.7 Other income (expense): Interest income 187 70 Interest expense (3,563) (0.1) (1,799) (0.1) Other income (expense), net 2,673 0.1 (525) Income before provision for income taxes 114,204 3.8 116,306 4.6 Income tax expense 30,823 1.0 31,300 1.2 Net income 83,381 2.8 85,006 3.4 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (4) Net income attributable to MYR Group Inc. 83,381 2.8 85,010 3.4 
 Revenues. Revenues increased 510.2 million, or 20.4 , to 3.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue on transmission projects, an increase in revenues on distribution projects, including incremental distribution revenues from the Powerline Plus Companies, and an increase in C I revenue in certain geographical areas. 
 Gross margin. Gross margin decreased to 11.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 13.0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to overall cost increases mainly associated with supply chain disruptions and inflation. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by labor and equipment inefficiencies, unfavorable change order adjustments and inclement weather experienced on certain projects. These margin decreases were partially offset by favorable job close outs, better-than-anticipated productivity on certain projects and favorable change order adjustments on certain projects. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects resulted in a gross margin decrease of 0.4 and an increase of 0.4 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Gross profit. Gross profit increased 19.0 million, or 5.8 , to 344.0 million for year ended December 31, 2022 from 325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to higher revenues, partially offset by lower margins. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A, was 222.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 15.2 million from 207.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the Powerline Plus Companies and an increase in employee-related expenses to support the growth in our operations, partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation costs. 
 Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets was 9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The period-over-period increase of 6.7 million was primarily due to amortization related to certain intangibles acquired with the Powerline Plus Companies. 
 Gain on sale of property and equipment. Gains from the sale of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2022 were 2.4 million compared to 3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment that is no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Interest expense. Interest expense was 3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt and interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Other income (expense), net . Other income was 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to other expense of 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change was largely due to funds received under the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy program, which were attributable to a C I segment company. Other income was also positively impacted by an adjustment to contingent earn-out consideration related to the acquisition of the Powerline Plus Companies. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, with an effective tax rate of 27.0 , compared to 31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an effective tax rate of 26.9 . The increase in the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to adjustments associated with the prior year global intangible low tax income GILTI ), partially offset by a favorable impact from stock compensation excess tax benefits. 
 Net income. Net income decreased to 83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily for the reasons stated above. 
 
 Segment Results 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, statements of operations data by segment, segment net sales as a percentage of total net sales and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Contract revenues: Transmission Distribution 1,745,792 58.0 1,301,587 52.1 Commercial Industrial 1,262,750 42.0 1,196,702 47.9 Total 3,008,542 100.0 2,498,289 100.0 Operating income (loss): Transmission Distribution 138,886 8.0 132,738 10.2 Commercial Industrial 43,159 3.4 54,418 4.5 Total 182,045 6.0 187,156 7.5 Corporate (67,138) (2.2) (68,596) (2.7) Consolidated 114,907 3.8 118,560 4.8 
 Transmission Distribution 
 Revenues for our T D segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1.75 billion compared to 1.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 444.2 million, or 34.1 . The increase in revenue was primarily related to an increase in revenue on transmission projects, and an increase in revenues on distribution projects, including incremental distribution revenues from the Powerline Plus Companies. 
 Operating income for our T D segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 138.9 million compared to 132.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 6.2 million, or 4.6 . The increase in T D operating income from the prior year was primarily due to higher revenues and a favorable job close-out. These increases were partially offset by the additional 6.7 million of amortization related to certain intangibles acquired with the Powerline Plus Companies and an unfavorable change order adjustment on a project. Operating income was also negatively impacted by overall cost increases from supply chain disruptions, labor inefficiencies, inflation and inclement weather experienced on certain projects. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our T D segment decreased to 8.0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Commercial Industrial 
 Revenues for our C I segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1.26 billion compared to 1.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 66.1 million, or 5.5 , primarily due to an increase in revenue in certain geographic areas.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Operating income for our C I segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 43.2 million compared to 54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 11.2 million, or 20.7 . The year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily due to overall cost increases mainly associated with supply chain disruptions and inflation. Operating income was also negatively impacted by labor inefficiencies on certain projects and an unfavorable change order adjustment on a project. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by better-than-anticipated productivity on various projects, favorable change order adjustments on certain projects and a favorable job close out. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our C I segment decreased to 3.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 4.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Corporate 
 The decrease in corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to a decrease in employee incentive compensation costs, partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses to support the growth in our operations. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 EBITDA 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by management that we define as net income attributable to MYR Group Inc. plus net income from noncontrolling interests, interest expense net of interest income, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, as shown in the following table. EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income attributable to MYR Group Inc. as a measure of operating performance or to net cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements in evaluating our operating performance and cash flow because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, useful lives placed on assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Because not all companies define EBITDA as we do, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. We use, and we believe investors benefit from, the presentation of EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. 
 Using EBITDA as a performance measure has material limitations as compared to net income, or other financial measures as defined under GAAP, as it excludes certain recurring items, which may be meaningful to investors. EBITDA excludes interest expense net of interest income; however, as we have borrowed money to finance transactions and operations, or invested available cash to generate interest income, interest expense and interest income are elements of our cost structure and can affect our ability to generate revenue and returns for our shareholders. Further, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization; however, as we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenues, depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of our costs and ability to generate revenue. Finally, EBITDA excludes income taxes; however, as we are organized as a corporation, the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. As a result of these exclusions from EBITDA, any measure that excludes interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization and income taxes has material limitations as compared to net income. When using EBITDA as a performance measure, management compensates for these limitations by comparing EBITDA to net income in each period, to allow for the comparison of the performance of the underlying core operations with the overall performance of the company on a full-cost, after-tax basis. Using both EBITDA and net income to evaluate the business allows management and investors to (a) assess our relative performance against our competitors and (b) monitor our capacity to generate returns for our shareholders.

 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to MYR Group Inc. to EBITDA: For the year ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Net income attributable to MYR Group Inc. 83,381 85,010 58,759 Net loss - noncontrolling interests (4) Net income 83,381 85,006 58,759 Interest expense, net 3,376 1,729 4,554 Income tax expense 30,823 31,300 22,626 Depreciation and amortization 58,170 46,205 46,453 EBITDA 175,750 164,240 132,392 
 We also use EBITDA as a liquidity measure. Certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement (the Credit Agreement are based on EBITDA with certain additional adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement. Non-compliance with these financial covenants under the Credit Agreement our interest coverage ratio which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by interest expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and our leverage ratio, which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we anticipated a potential covenant violation, we would seek relief from our lenders, likely causing us to incur additional cost, and such relief might not be available, or if available, might not be on terms as favorable as those in the Credit Agreement. In addition, if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under the Credit Agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making certain payments, and acquiring or disposing of assets. Based on the information above, management believes that the presentation of EBITDA as a liquidity measure is useful to investors and relevant to their assessment of our capacity to service or incur debt, fund capital expenditures, finance acquisitions and expand our operations.

 Working Capital 
 Working capital is a non-GAAP measure. We believe working capital is useful to investors and other external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements in evaluating our operating performance. The Company defines working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. The following table provides the Company s calculation of working capital: As of December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Total current assets 890,291 748,390 636,684 Less: total current liabilities (666,960) (498,599) (443,400) Working capital 223,331 249,791 193,284

 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Material Cash Requirements 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had working capital of 223.3 million and 249.8 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our operating activities provided cash of 167.5 million, compared to 137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services, operating margins, timing of contract performance and the type of services we provide to our customers. The 30.3 million year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 15.1 million, partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in net income. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the favorable change of 27.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by the net unfavorable changes of 16.6 million in other liabilities. The favorable change in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to the timing of insurance payments and the prepayment of materials required for certain projects. The unfavorable change in other liabilities was primarily due to lower bonus and profit sharing accruals, and payments related to our deferral under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") partially offset by the timing of other employee related wage and tax payments. In addition, the net favorable year-over-year changes in various working capital accounts that relate primarily to the timing of costs incurred on work performed that does not coincide with the billing terms (accounts receivable, contract assets, accounts payable and contract liabilities) was 0.3 million. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we used net cash of 185.7 million and 49.3 million, respectively, in investing activities. The 185.7 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of 110.7 million to acquire the Powerline Plus Companies, 77.1 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by 2.0 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. The 49.3 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of 52.4 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by 3.1 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we used cash of 9.3 million, and 28.1 million, respectively in financing activities. The 9.3 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of 37.0 million of shares repurchases under our share repurchase program, 6.8 million of shares repurchased to satisfy tax obligations under our stock compensation programs, 1.6 million of repayments of finance lease obligations and 1.0 million of net repayments under our master equipment loan agreements. These uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2022, were partially offset by 24.2 million of borrowing under our equipment notes and 12.9 million of net borrowing under our revolving line of credit. The 28.1 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of 24.9 million of net repayments under our master equipment loan agreements, and 3.4 million of cash used to purchase shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax obligations under our stock compensation programs. 
 We believe our 349.3 million borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit at December 31, 2022, future cash flow from operations and our ability to utilize short-term and long-term leases will provide sufficient liquidity for our short-tern and long-term needs. Our primary short-term liquidity needs include cash for operations, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, acquisition and joint venture opportunities. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our long-term liquidity needs and foreseeable material cash requirements, including those associated with funding future acquisition opportunities. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T D and C I markets and in procuring the specific specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. 
 We have not historically paid dividends and currently do not expect to pay dividends.

 Debt Instruments 
 Credit Agreement 
 On September 13, 2019, we entered into a five-year amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. The Credit Agreement provides for a facility of 375 million (the Facility ), subject to certain financial covenants as defined in the Credit Agreement, that may be used for revolving loans of which 150 million may be used for letters of credit. The Facility also allows for revolving loans and letters of credit in Canadian dollars and other currencies, up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of 75 million. We have an expansion option to increase the commitments under the Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional 200 million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, our domestic subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Facility are used for refinancing existing debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes. 
 Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (1) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00 to 0.75 ; or (2) Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.75 . Once LIBOR is no longer available, we will amend the Credit Agreement to transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or will elect the Alternate Base Rate. The applicable margin is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio Leverage Ratio which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Letters of credit issued under the Facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.00 to 1.75 for non-performance letters of credit or 0.50 to 0.875 for performance letters of credit, based on our consolidated Leverage Ratio. We are subject to a commitment fee of 0.15 to 0.25 , based on our consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused portion of the Facility. The Credit Agreement restricts certain types of payments when our consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 2.50 or our consolidated Liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 50 million. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to certain financial covenants and are limited to a maximum consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0. The minimum interest coverage ratio is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by interest expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement also contains a number of covenants, including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. We were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2022 we had 12.9 million debt outstanding under the Facility. We had no debt outstanding under the Facility as of December 31, 2021. 
 Letters of Credit 
 Some of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our insurance programs. In addition, from time to time certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors and guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution typically pursuant to our senior credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. 
 As of December 31, 2022, and 2021 we had 12.8 million and 12.3 million, respectively, in nonperformance letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement which were almost entirely related to the Company's payment obligation under its insurance programs. These are irrevocable, standby letters of credit with maturities expiring at various times throughout 2023. We expect to renew the letters of credit related to the insurance programs for subsequent one-year periods upon their maturity. We are not aware of any claims currently asserted or threatened under any of these letters of credit that are material, individually or in the aggregate. However, to the extent payment is required for any of such claims, the amount paid could be material and could adversely affect cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Equipment Notes 
 We have entered into multiple Master Loan Agreements with multiple banks. The Master Loan Agreements may be used for financing of equipment between us and the lenders pursuant to one or more equipment notes Equipment Notes ). Each Equipment Note constitutes a separate, distinct and independent financing of equipment and contractual obligation. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had two outstanding Equipment Notes collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by us. As of December 31, 2022, we also had one other equipment note outstanding collateralized by a vehicle owned by us. The outstanding balance of all Equipment Notes was 27.6 million as of December 31, 2022, of which 5.1 million was due in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, we had one outstanding Equipment Note collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by us. The outstanding balance of these Equipment Notes was 4.5 million as of December 31, 2021, of which 1.0 million was due in the next twelve months. 
 Lease Obligations 
 From time to time, the Company enters into non-cancelable leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow the Company to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. The Company s leases have remaining terms ranging from one to seven years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within one year. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is ongoing and the purchase option price is attractive. 
 The outstanding balance of operating lease obligations was 30.5 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding short-term and long-term operating lease obligations of approximately 9.7 million and 20.8 million, respectively. The outstanding balance of operating lease obligations was 21.0 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding short-term and long-term operating lease obligations of approximately 7.8 million and 13.2 million, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 3.4 million outstanding finance lease obligations, consisting of short-term and long-term finance lease obligations of approximately 1.1 million and 2.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding finance lease obligations. 
 Purchase Commitments for Construction Equipment 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 14.1 million in outstanding purchase obligations for certain construction equipment to be paid with cash outlays scheduled to occur over the first four months of 2023. 
 Performance and Payment Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
 Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse our sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur. Under our continuing indemnity and security agreements with our sureties, with the consent of our lenders under the Credit Agreement, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety. We may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the surety or our customers. Posting letters of credit in favor of the surety or our customers reduces the borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to any of our sureties for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of approximately 1.97 billion in original face amount of bonds issued by our sureties were outstanding. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately 880.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 From time to time we guarantee the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements, and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Additionally, from time to time we are required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under our credit facility.

 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 We grant trade credit under contractual payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors. However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, none of our customers individually exceeded 10.0 of our accounts receivable. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Organization, Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our Financial Statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements: 
 Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services provided. Revenue associated with contracts with customers is recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances customer-controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. To determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, we estimate profit by determining the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract. In addition, we estimate a cost accrual every quarter that represents unbilled invoicing activity for services performed by subcontractors and suppliers during the quarter, and estimate revenue from the contract cost portion of this accrual based on current gross margin rates to be consistent with our cost method of revenue recognition. The estimated value of unbilled amounts are determined using a regression analysis that estimates value based on our historical experience, and is adjusted for large individual projects. The profit and corresponding revenue is recognized over the contract term based on costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method. We utilized the cost-to-cost method as we believe cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on our projects, and is the most common basis for computing percentage of completion in our industry. For purposes of recognizing revenue, we follow the five-step approach outlined in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606-10-25. 
 As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, we calculate the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Because our billings are based on contract terms and do not coincide with our progress in a project, revenue recognition also includes an amount related to our contract asset or contract liability. If the recognized revenue is greater than the amount billed to the customer, a contract asset is recorded. Additionally, the contract asset includes retainage billed to the customer that cannot be collected until the contract work has been completed and approved. Conversely, if the amount billed to the customer is greater than the recognized revenue, a contract liability is recorded. Additionally, the contract liability includes a liability for the excess of costs over revenues for all contracts that are in a loss position.

 Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Additionally, we estimate costs to complete on fixed price contracts which are determined on an individual contract basis by evaluating each project s status as of the balance sheet date, and using our historical experience with the level of effort required to complete the underlying project. Claims and change orders are also measured based on our historical experience with individual customers and similar contracts, and are evaluated by management individually. A change order is a modification to a contract that changes the provisions of the contract, typically resulting from changes in scope, specifications, design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work under the contract. A claim is an amount in excess of the agreed-upon contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for client-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes. We include these estimated amounts of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenues of 19.6 million and 2.4 million, respectively, related to significant change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts, some of which are multi-year projects. 
 Some of our contracts may have contract terms that include variable consideration such as safety or performance bonuses or liquidated damages. In accordance with ASC 606-10-32, we estimate the variable consideration using one of two methods. In contracts in which there is a binary outcome, the most likely amount method is used. In instances in which there is a range of possible outcomes, the expected value method is used. In accordance with ASC 606-10-32-11, we include the estimated amount of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative recognized revenue will not occur when the final outcome of the variable consideration is determined. In contracts in which a significant reversal may occur, we use constraint in recognizing revenue on variable consideration. Although we often enter into contracts that contain liquidated damage clauses, we rarely incur them, and as such, we do not include amounts associated with liquidated damage clauses until it is probable that liquidated damages will occur. These items are continually monitored by multiple levels of management throughout the reporting period. 
 A portion of the work we perform requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds or letters of credit at the time of execution of the contract. Many of our contracts include retention provisions of up to 10 , which are generally withheld from each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved. 
 The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a detailed bottoms up approach and we believe our experience typically allows us to provide materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include, among others: 
 the completeness and accuracy of the original bid; 
 costs associated with scope changes, change orders or claims; 
 costs of labor and/or materials; 
 extended overhead due to owner, weather and other delays; 
 subcontractor performance issues; 
 changes in productivity expectations; 
 site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid (to the extent contract remedies are unavailable); 
 the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; and 
 a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials. 
 The foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods. During the year ended December 31, 2022, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 0.4 . During the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects increased consolidated gross margin by 0.4 . During the year ended December 31, 2020, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 0.8 . 
 We provide warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry; however, the warranty period does not typically exceed one year. Historically, warranty claims have not been material. 
 Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Sales tax and value added tax collected from customers is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

 Insurance. We carry insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Our deductible for each line of coverage is up to 1.0 million, except for wildfire coverage which has a deductible of 2.0 million. Certain health benefit plans are subject to stop-loss limits of up to 0.2 million, for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible and stop-loss amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. 
 The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Stock-Based Compensation. We determine compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair values at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize compensation expense related to stock-based awards, such as restricted stock and restricted stock units, that have only service conditions. This method recognizes stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. We recognize compensation expense related to performance awards that vest based on internal performance metrics and service conditions on a straight-line basis over the service period, but adjust inception-to-date expense based upon our determination of the expected achievement of the performance target at each reporting date which may vary from zero to 200 of the target performance awards. We recognize compensation expense related to performance awards with market-based performance metrics on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. Shares issued under the Company s stock-based compensation program are taken out of authorized but unissued shares. 
 Goodwill and Intangibles. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis. This assessment is performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or when circumstances change, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or the decision to sell a business, both of which would indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are also reviewed for impairment and tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
 A qualitative assessment considers financial, industry, segment and macroeconomic factors, if the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative assessment is performed to determine if impairment exists. The quantitative assessment begins with a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit or intangible asset. If the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded in the statement of operations. 
 As a result of the annual qualitative review process in 2022 and 2020, we determined it was not necessary to perform a qualitative assessment. In 2021, we performed a quantitative assessment on our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, this assessment did not indicate that our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired. 
 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We do not generally charge interest to our customers, and we carry our customer receivables at their face amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our experience in recent years, the majority of customer balances at each balance sheet date are collected within twelve months. As is common practice in the industry, we classify all accounts receivable as current assets. The allowance for doubtful accounts associated with account receivables was 2.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2.4 million as of December 31, 2021. 
 We grant trade credit, on a non-collateralized basis (with the exception of lien rights against the property in certain cases) to our customers, and we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and overall economic activity. We analyze specific accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In the event that a customer balance is deemed to be uncollectible the account balance is written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.

 We were not parties to any derivative instruments and had no derivative financial instruments during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 Any borrowings under our Facility are based upon interest rates that will vary depending upon the prime rate, Canadian prime rate, federal funds effective rate, the NYFRB overnight bank funding rate, CDOR, and LIBOR (or any interest rate replacing LIBOR). If the prime rate, Canadian prime rate, federal funds effective rate, the NYFRB overnight bank funding rate, CDOR, or LIBOR (or any interest rate replacing LIBOR) rises, any interest payment obligations would increase and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition. We currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest when we have outstanding borrowings. As of December 31, 2022, we had 12.9 million of borrowings under our Facility. If market rates of interest on all our revolving debt as of December 31, 2022, which is subject to variable rates, permanently increased by 1 , the increase in interest expense on all revolving debt would decrease future income before provision for income taxes and cash flows by approximately 0.1 million annually. If market rates of interest on all our revolving debt, which is subject to variable rates as of December 31, 2022, permanently decreased by 1 , the decrease in interest expense on all debt would increase future income before provision for income taxes and cash flows by approximately 0.1 million annually. 
 Borrowings under our Equipment Notes are at fixed rates established on the date the note was executed.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management s assessment of and conclusion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 excluded the internal control over financial reporting of Powerline Plus Ltd. and its affiliate PLP Redimix Ltd. (collectively, the Powerline Plus Companies"), which were acquired on January 4, 2022. The Powerline Plus Companies represented a total of approximately 3.2 and 1.1 of total out of scope assets and net assets, respectively as of December 31, 2022, and 2.6 and 6.7 of contract revenues and out of scope income before income taxes, respectively, for the year then ended. Such exclusion is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance that the assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management s report on internal controls over financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place during the fiscal year being assessed. 
 Crowe LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the 2022 Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of MYR Group s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and has issued an attestation report on MYR Group s internal control over financial reporting which appears herein.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of MYR Group Inc. 
 Thornton, CO 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MYR Group Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. As permitted, the Company has excluded the operations of Powerline Plus Ltd. and its affiliate PLP Redimix Ltd. acquired during 2022, which is described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, from the scope of management s report on internal control over financial reporting. As such, it has also been excluded from the scope of our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Evaluation of estimated costs to complete and variable consideration for fixed price construction contracts 
 As described in Note 1 of the Company s consolidated financial statements, Organization, Business, and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenue on fixed price construction projects over time using the cost-to-cost method. The amount of contract revenues and gross profit recognized on fixed price construction contracts is dependent on the contract price, the actual contract costs incurred, and the forecasted contract revenues and contract costs for construction projects. The recognition of revenue on fixed price construction contracts involves significant estimates due to the unique complexities of each construction project, uncertainty about estimates of costs to complete, and uncertainty in the outcome of discussions with customers on the valuation of change orders and claims. The Company measures progress towards completion using the cost-to-cost method, which measures the progress as the ratio of actual contract costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion. The Company recognizes revenue related to change orders only when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. The Company evaluates change orders and claims based on historical experience with the customer, similar contracts, and on an individual basis, which involves significant judgment. The Company recognizes these estimated amounts of variable consideration in transaction price to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. 
 We identified auditing management s estimates of variable consideration for change orders and claims and estimated costs to complete on select fixed price construction contracts to be a critical audit matter. The critical audit matter relates to select fixed price construction contracts, based on the magnitude of estimated costs to complete and the stage of completion of the contract. These estimates require management to make assumptions about future events and, as a result, a high degree of auditor judgment is involved in auditing these estimates. Due to the factors above, auditing management s estimates of costs to complete and variable consideration required extensive audit procedures. 
 Our audit procedures to address the critical audit matter included the following: 
 Tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls that are designed to address the reasonableness of estimates of costs to complete contracts and estimates of variable consideration recognized on contracts; 
 Evaluated the reasonableness of management s estimates of cost to complete for a sample of fixed price construction contracts through testing the key components of the estimated costs to complete, including materials, labor, and subcontractor costs; 
 Agreed a sample of contract costs incurred to supporting documentation; 
 Performed inquiries of management and project personnel regarding facts and circumstances relevant to the accounting for such contracts; 
 Recalculated revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion of projects; 
 Evaluated variable consideration recognized related to construction projects by comparing estimates made by management to subsequent actual data, evaluating the contracts and other documents that support estimates made by management, and obtaining legal opinions from internal and external counsel; and 
 Performed retrospective review procedures to assess management s historical ability to accurately estimate the transaction price and cost to complete of construction contracts.

 Valuation of contingent earn-out consideration and customer relationships acquired associated with the acquisition of Powerline Plus Companies 
 As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Powerline Plus Ltd. and its affiliate PLP Redimix Ltd. (collectively, the Powerline Plus Companies") in 2022 for total consideration of approximately 111.5 million, net of cash acquired. Total consideration included approximately 0.9 million of contingent earn-out consideration measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Assets acquired included approximately 39.8 million of customer relationships (intangible assets) that were valued at fair value as of the acquisition date. Auditing the valuation of contingent earn-out consideration and customer relationships acquired involved a high degree of subjectivity. Significant auditor judgment was involved in evaluating the valuation methodology (used in estimating the contingent earn-out consideration and the significant assumptions used in the valuations of both the contingent earn-out consideration and customer relationships intangible asset. The estimates included certain assumptions that involved a high degree of subjectivity and auditor judgment. As a result, extensive audit procedures were involved in auditing the estimates and significant assumptions. 
 Our audit procedures related to testing the valuation of contingent earn-out consideration and customer relationships acquired included the following: 
 Tested controls over the accounting for the acquisition, including controls over the recognition and measurement of customer relationships and contingent earn-out consideration; 
 Read the purchase agreement and compared the terms of the purchase agreement to management s application of purchase accounting for this acquisition; 
 Evaluated the methods used in developing the fair value estimates and tested the recognition of the contingent earn-out consideration and customer relationships at fair value; 
 Assessed whether all intangible assets were properly identified; 
 Evaluated the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in valuing the contingent earn-out considerations and customer relationships, including estimated revenue and revenue growth rates, attrition rate, income tax rate, projected profit margins, and discount rates. Specifically, we considered the past performance of the Powerline Plus Companies and considered whether significant assumptions used were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit; 
 Assessed the terms of the contingent earn-out consideration, which included projected revenue and operating profit projection criteria; and 
 Evaluated management s classification of earn-out payments to continuing employees as either contingent consideration in the business combination or employee compensation.

If an investment in a joint venture contains a recourse or unfunded commitments to provide additional equity, distributions and/or losses in excess of the investment a liability is recorded in other current liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. For joint ventures which the Company does not have a controlling interest, the Company s share of any profits and assets and its share of any losses and liabilities are recognized based on the Company s stated percentage partnership interest in the joint venture, and are normally recorded by the Company one month in arrears. The investments in joint ventures are recorded at cost and the carrying amounts are adjusted to recognize the Company s proportionate share of cumulative income or loss, additional contributions made and dividends and capital distributions received. The Company records the effect of any impairment or any other-than-temporary decrease in the value of the joint venture investment as incurred, which may or may not be one month in arrears, depending on when the Company obtains the joint venture activity information. Additionally, the Company continually assesses the fair value of its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures despite using information that is one month in arrears for regular reporting purposes. The Company includes only its percentage ownership of each joint venture in its backlog.

Currently, all the Company s leases contain fixed payment terms. The Company may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Additionally, all of the Company s month-to-month leases are cancelable, by the Company or the lessor, at any time and are not included in our right-of-use asset or liability. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had several leases with residual value guarantees. The total amount probable of being owed of residual leases guarantees is not significant. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is ongoing and the purchase option price is attractive. Nonperformance-related default covenants, cross-default provisions, subjective default provisions and material adverse change clauses contained in material lease agreements, if any, are also evaluated to determine whether those clauses affect lease classification in accordance with ASC Topic 842-10-25. Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases, depending on the terms of the lease. 
 Finance Leases. The Company leases some vehicles and certain equipment under finance leases. The economic substance of the leases is a financing transaction for acquisition of the vehicles and equipment. Accordingly, the right-of-use assets for these leases are included on the Company s consolidated balance sheets in property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, with a corresponding amount recorded in current portion of finance lease obligations or finance lease obligations, net of current maturities, as appropriate. The finance lease assets are amortized over the life of the lease or, if shorter, the life of the leased asset, on a straight-line basis and included in depreciation expense. The financing component associated with finance lease obligations is included in interest expense. Generally, for the Company s finance leases an implicit rate to calculate present value is provided in the lease agreement. However, if a rate in not provided the Company determines this rate by estimating the Company s incremental borrowing rate, utilizing the borrowing rates associated with the Company s various debt instruments.

 The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends.

 The Company grants trade credit under contractual payment terms, generally without collateral, to its customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties. Consequently, the Company is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors. However, the Company generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, the Company may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, none of the Company s customers individually exceeded 10.0 of accounts receivable. The Company believes the terms and conditions in its contracts, billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately of the Company s craft labor employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.

 Additionally, the acquisition includes contingent earn-out consideration that may be payable if the Powerline Plus Companies achieve certain performance targets over a post-acquisition period. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was million. The future payout of the contingent earn-out consideration, if any, is unlimited and could be significantly higher than the acquisition date fair value. If the minimum thresholds of the performance targets are achieved the contingent earn-out consideration payment will be approximately million. Changes in contingent earn-out consideration, subsequent to the acquisition, of approximately million were recorded in other income, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The results of the Powerline Plus Companies are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements beginning on the transaction date. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized approximately million, of acquisition-related costs associated with this acquisition. 
 The purchase agreement also includes contingent consideration provisions for down-side margin guarantee adjustments based upon certain contract performance subsequent to the acquisition. The contracts were valued at fair value at the acquisition date, causing no margin guarantee estimate or adjustments for fair value. Unfavorable changes in contract estimates, such as modified costs to complete or change order recognition, will result in changes to these margin guarantee estimates. changes in margin guarantee adjustments on contracts, subsequent to the acquisition, have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. Future margin guarantee adjustments, if any, will be recognized in other income in 2023.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value based on Level 1 inputs. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the Company s long-term debt and finance lease obligations were based on Level 2 inputs. The Company s long-term debt was based on variable and fixed interest rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Long-term debt, if any, with variable interest rates are based on rates for new issues with similar remaining maturities, and approximated carrying value. In addition, based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for borrowings with similar terms, the carrying values of the Company s long term debt with fixed interest rates also approximated fair value. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the fair values of the Company s contingent earn-out consideration liability associated with the acquisition of the Powerline Plus Companies was based on Level 3 inputs. The contingent earn-out consideration recorded represents the estimated fair values of future amounts potentially payable to the former owners of the acquired Powerline Plus Companies and was initially determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology based on probability-weighted performance projections and other inputs, including a discount rate and an expected volatility factor. The fair value of this contingent earn-out consideration liability will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by management. Accordingly, the level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level (Level 3). Significant changes in any of these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower potential liability.

 Credit Agreement 
 On September 13, 2019, the Company entered into a amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A, that provides for a million facility (the Facility ), subject to certain financial covenants as defined in the Credit Agreement, that may be used for revolving loans of which million may be used for letters of credit. The Facility also allows for revolving loans and letters of credit in Canadian dollars and other currencies, up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of million. The Company has an expansion option to increase the commitments under the Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of the Company. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company s domestic subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are used for refinancing existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. 
 Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at a rate equal to either (1) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from to ; or (2) Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from to . Once LIBOR is no longer available, the Company will amend the Credit Agreement to transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or will elect the Alternate Base Rate. The applicable margin is determined based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio (the Leverage Ratio which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Letters of credit issued under the Facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of to for non-performance letters of credit or to for performance letters of credit, based on the Company s consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Company is subject to a commitment fee of to , based on the Company s consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused portion of the Facility. The Credit Agreement restricts certain types of payments when the Company s consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds or the Company s consolidated Liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than million. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding on the Facility for the year ended December 31, 2022, was per annum. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain financial covenants and is limited to a maximum consolidated Leverage Ratio of and a minimum interest coverage ratio of , which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by interest expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement also contains covenants including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022.

 Performance and Payment Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
 In certain circumstances, the Company is required to provide performance and payment bonds in connection with its future performance on certain contractual commitments. The Company has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these bonds. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of approximately billion in original face amount of bonds issued by the Company s sureties were outstanding. The Company estimated the remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately million as of December 31, 2022. 
 From time to time the Company guarantees the obligations of wholly-owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Additionally, from time to time the Company is required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under the Facility. 
 Indemnities 
 From time to time, pursuant to its service arrangements, the Company indemnifies its customers for claims related to the services it provides under those service arrangements. These indemnification obligations may subject the Company to indemnity claims, liabilities and related litigation. The Company is not aware of any material unrecorded liabilities for asserted claims in connection with these indemnification obligations. 
 Collective Bargaining Agreements 
 Most of the Company s subsidiaries craft labor employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The agreements require the subsidiaries to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans. If a subsidiary withdraws from any of the multi-employer pension plans or if the plans were to otherwise become underfunded, the subsidiary could incur liabilities for additional contributions related to these plans. Although the Company has been informed that the status of some multi-employer pension plans to which its subsidiaries contribute have been classified as critical the Company is not currently aware of any potential liabilities related to this issue. See Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans to the Financial Statements for further information related to the Company s participation in multi-employer plans. 
 Litigation and Other Legal Matters 
 The Company is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The Company is routinely subject to other civil claims, litigation and arbitration, and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of our present business as well as in respect of our divested businesses. Some of these claims and litigations include claims related to the Company s current services and operations, the Company believes that it has strong defenses to these claims as well as insurance coverages that could contribute to any settlement or liability in the event claims are not resolved in our favor. These claims have not had a material impact on the Company to date, and the Company believes that the likelihood that a future material adverse outcome will result from these claims is remote. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future, the Company cannot be certain that an adverse outcome of one or more of these claims would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Upon the initial adoption of the LTIP in 2017, awards were no longer granted under the 2007 LTIP. The LTIP was approved by our shareholders and provides for grants of (a) incentive stock options qualified as such under U.S. federal income tax laws, (b) stock options that do not qualify as incentive stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights, (d) restricted stock awards, (e) restricted stock units, (f) performance awards, (g) phantom stock, (h) stock bonuses, (i) dividend equivalents, or (j) any combination of such awards. The LTIP permits the granting of up to shares to directors, officers and other employees of the Company. Grants of awards to employees are approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and grants to independent members of the Board of Directors are approved by the Board of Directors. All awards are made with an exercise price or base price, as the case may be, that is not less than the full fair market value per share on the date of grant. No stock option or stock appreciation right may be exercised more than years from the date of grant. 
 Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or stock grants are made available from authorized unissued shares of common stock or treasury stock. 
 Stock Options 
 The Company has not awarded any stock options since 2013.

 Performance Awards 
 The Company grants performance awards under the LTIP. Under these awards, shares of the Company s common stock may be earned based on the Company s performance compared to defined metrics. The number of shares earned under a performance award may vary from to of the target shares awarded, based upon the Company s performance compared to the metrics. The metrics used for the grant are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and may be either based on internal measures such as the Company s financial performance compared to target or on a market-based metric such as the Company s stock performance compared to a peer group. Performance awards cliff vest upon attainment of at least the minimum stated performance targets and minimum service requirements and are paid in the Company s common stock. 
 For performance awards, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of internal metric-based performance awards is determined by the closing stock price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of market-based performance awards is computed using a Monte Carlo simulation. Performance awards granted in 2022 are expensed over the service period of approximately years. The Company adjusts the stock-based compensation expense related to internal metric-based performance awards according to its determination of the shares expected to vest at each reporting date. Stock-based compensation expense related to market metric-based performance awards is expensed at their grant date fair value regardless of performance. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, performance award vesting activity settled in common stock had an intrinsic value, at the time of vesting, of million, million and million, respectively.

 The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees, who are represented by more than local unions. The related collective-bargaining agreements between those organizations and the Company, which specify the rate at which the Company must contribute to the multi-employer defined pension plan, expire at different times between 2023 and 2025. 
 The risks of participating in these multiemployer defined benefit pension plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: 
 1) Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. 
 2) If a participating employer stops contributing to a plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.

 reporting segments, each a separate operating segment, which are referred to as T D and C I. Performance measurement and resource allocation for the reporting segments are based on many factors. The primary financial measures used to evaluate the segment information are contract revenues and income from operations, excluding general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses include corporate facility and staffing costs, which includes safety costs, professional fees, IT expenses and management fees. 
 Transmission and Distribution: The T D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. T D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems and clean energy projects. The T D segment also provides emergency restoration services in response to hurricane, wildfire, ice or other damage. T D customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. 
 Commercial and Industrial: The C I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting and signalization. Typical C I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities and transportation control and management systems. The C I segment generally provides electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C I industry, but also contracts directly with facility owners.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management, together with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance related to the matters stated in the above paragraph as of December 31, 2022. 
 We completed our acquisition of the Powerline Plus Companies on January 4, 2022 and have not yet included the Powerline Plus Companies in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently integrating the Powerline Plus Companies into our operations, compliance programs and internal control processes. Accordingly, pursuant to the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures does not include the Powerline Plus Companies. As of December 31, 2022, the Powerline Plus Companies represented a total of approximately 3.2 and 1.1 of out of scope total assets and net assets, respectively, and 2.6 and 6.7 of contract revenues and out of scope income before income taxes, respectively, for the year then ended. 
 Management s Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, as of December 31, 2022, in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the Powerline Plus Companies, which was acquired on January 4, 2022. Pursuant to the SEC s general guidance that a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of the acquisition, the scope of our assessment does not include the Powerline Plus Companies. As of December 31, 2022, the Powerline Plus Companies represented a total of approximately 3.2 and 1.1 of out of scope total assets and net assets, respectively, and 2.6 and 6.7 of contract revenues and out of scope income before income taxes, respectively, for the year then ended.

 In addition, Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited and reported on the 2022 Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will detect or prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
