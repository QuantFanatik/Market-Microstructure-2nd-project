PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Development of Business ATEL 15, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on March 4, 2011 Date of Inception for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Managing Member, LLC (the Managing Member or Manager ), a Nevada limited liability company. The Managing Member is controlled by ATEL Financial Services, LLC AFS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group. The Fund may continue until terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Agreement. Contributions in the amount of 500 were received as of May 3, 2011, which represented the initial member s capital investment. As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a price of 10 per Unit. As of December 21, 2011, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least 7.5 million. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on April 4, 2012, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts. The offering was terminated on October 28, 2013. As of December 31, 2022, cumulative gross contributions, less rescissions and repurchases (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs, as applicable), totaling 65.9 million (inclusive of the 500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received. As of the same date, 6,542,557 Units were issued and outstanding. The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that will (i) preserve, protect and return the Company s invested capital; (ii) generate regular cash distributions to members, with any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (ending six calendar years after the completion of the Company s public offering of Units) and (iii) provide additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets has been sold or otherwise disposed. The Company is governed by the ATEL 15, LLC amended and restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated October 28, 2011 (the Operating Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Managing Member and/or its affiliates receives compensation for services rendered and reimbursements for costs incurred on behalf of the Company (See Note 6, Related party transactions as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data). The Company is required to maintain reasonable cash reserves for working capital, the repurchase of Units and contingencies. The repurchase of Units is solely at the discretion of the Managing Member. Narrative Description of Business The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers. The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as the core operating equipment used by companies in the manufacturing, mining and transportation industries. A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment. The Company will also seek investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.

The Company only purchased equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase. Through December 31, 2022, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of 64.8 million. The Company had also funded investments in notes receivable totaling 9.4 million through December 31, 2022. As of the date of the final commitment of its proceeds from the sale of Units, the Company s objective is to have at least 75 of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate creditors and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate creditors. High quality corporate creditors are lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa3 or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities. The remaining 25 of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other debt or equity financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above. Included in this 25 of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments. No more than 20 of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20 of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments. The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25 of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above. The equipment financing industry is highly competitive. Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment. The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence. The Managing Member will use its best efforts to diversify lessees by geography and industry and to maintain an appropriate balance and diversity in the types of equipment acquired and the types of leases entered into by the Company, and will apply the following policies: (i) The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20 of the aggregate purchase price of investments as of the final commitment of net offering proceeds; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20 of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or 30,000,000); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20 of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer. However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest. The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities is North America. All of the Company s current operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in the United States. The business of the Company is not seasonal. The Company has no full time employees. Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate. The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement. For further information refer to the financial statements and the footnotes.

PART II Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement. Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop. In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. Fund Valuation Background to Fund Valuation The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC updated rules for the presentation of account statement values relative to pricing of Direct Placement Program DPP shares. Under FINRA Notice 15-02 (the Notice the SEC approved amendments to National Association of Securities Dealers NASD Rule 2340, Customer Account Statements, and FINRA rule 2310, which address a FINRA member firm s participation in a public offering of a DPP. In summary, the amendments require a FINRA member firm to include in the account statements for customers holding DPP securities a per share value for the DPP. This per share value must be prepared by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service. The results of this valuation must be disclosed in the issuer s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A valuation in compliance with the Notice must be undertaken and published on at least an annual basis. The effective date of the Notice was April 11, 2016. Methodologies Broker dealers are required to provide a per share estimated value on the customer account statements for each non-listed DPP security held by their customers. Such estimated value must have been developed in a manner reasonably designed to provide a reliable value. Two valuation methodologies have been defined by FINRA, which by such designation are presumed to be reliable. Net Investment Methodology The amendments to NASD Rule 2340(c)(1)(A) require net investment to be based on the amount available for investment percentage disclosed in the Estimated Use of Proceeds section of the issuer s offering prospectus. In essence, such value is equal to the offering price less selling commissions, other offering and organization expenses, and capital reserves. This method may be used for up to 150 days following the second anniversary of a Fund breaking escrow. Appraised Value Methodology As amended, Rule NASD 2340(c)(1)(B) requires that the per share estimated value disclosed in an issuer s most recent periodic or current report be based upon an appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the program by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service, in conformity with standard industry valuation practice as it relates to both the aforementioned assets and liabilities. No later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the issuer s break of escrow for its minimum offering, this methodology must be used to establish the required estimated values.

Unit Valuation The per Unit valuation estimate for ATEL 15, LLC has been conducted, and the results disclosed herein, in compliance with the mandates of the Notice. For ATEL 15, LLC , its estimated value per Unit reflects the Manager s estimate of current portfolio valuation of all assets and liabilities of the Fund, calculated on a per Unit basis, and as such, does not represent a market value for the Units and may not accurately reflect the value of the Fund Units to the Unit holders if held over time to Fund maturity. In connection with any estimate of per Unit value, Unit holders and all parties are reminded that no public market for the Units exists. Additionally, in order to preserve the Fund s pass-through status for federal income tax purposes, the Fund will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units. In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. The estimate of per Unit value does not take into account any extraordinary potential future business activity of the Fund; rather the valuation represents a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date. In addition, the Fund does not include any analysis of the distributions that have already been paid by the Fund, nor the anticipated returns to Unit holder over the full course of the Fund life cycle, which will be dependent on many factors. Disclosure The estimated value per Unit reported in this Form 10-K has been calculated using the Appraised Value Methodology described above under Methodologies above, as of December 31, 2022. ATEL 15, LLC , will satisfy the disclosure requirements for providing estimated per Unit values pursuant to the Notice as follows: For these disclosures, subsequent to the Fund s initial compliance with FINRA 15-02, annual disclosures of estimated per Unit values, through the termination of the Fund; will be accomplished and included on an annual basis in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available to the public. Specifics Underlying Valuation Methodology: Notes and Explanation of Valuation Components and Calculation A. Fund Assets and Liabilities (other than as specifically identified below) : The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as current assets and liabilities are assumed to equal their reported GAAP balances as an appropriate approximation of their fair values. Debt (interest bearing) is assumed to equal the fair values of the debt as disclosed in the footnotes of the financial statements. B. Investment in equipment and leases (net of fees and expenses) : The estimated values for equipment are based on calculating the present value of the projected future cash flows. Projected future cash flows include both the remaining contractual lease payments, plus assumptions on lease renewals and sale value of the residuals. Projected future cash flows are net of projected future fees and expenses including: management fees applicable for the Fund (4.00 of revenue) carried interest applicable for the Fund (7.50 of distributions) operating expenses which are assumed to be 3 of original equipment costs for the Fund 
 Projected future cash flows have been discounted back to present value at discount rates based on like-term U.S. Treasury yields (as of the valuation date) plus a 400 basis point spread, to account for the credit risk differentials between the instrument being valued and U.S. Treasury security yields. 
 8 

Residual values assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows: For On-Lease and Month-to-Month Lease : Considers realized residual as a percent of book residual of 168.7 , based on ATEL s historical track record as of December 31, 2022. For Off-Lease : A fair value of off-lease equipment based upon estimates from ATEL s seasoned Asset Management Group. Special Situation Leases : The valuation of certain leases has been performed outside of the above noted protocol based upon specific lease assumptions different than the macro assumptions above, due to the specific situations of those leases. C. Investments in Notes Receivable : The estimated values for Investments in Notes Receivable are estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market value techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary. D. Investments in Equity Securities : The estimated values for Investments in Equity Securities have been based on the estimated net book value as of the valuation date (with impairment adjustments), plus any unrealized gain on equity. The unrealized gain on equity is based on either: a) the most recent round of financing, b) the most recent 409A valuation provided by the underlying companies of the warrants, or c) the Manager s estimate of the company valuations based on all available information, including company financials, company valuation reports, public press releases, and other sources. E. Warrants Outstanding: The estimated values for Warrants Outstanding considers the reported GAAP balances to be an appropriate approximation of their fair values. F. Accrued distributions : Accrued distributions, which are payable to the Unit holders have been removed from the balance sheet liability section because they are not a liability to a third party. ATEL 15, LLC Unit Valuation The Manager s estimated per Unit value of ATEL 15, LLC at December 31, 2022 as determined, and derived under the guidelines of the Appraised Value Methodology, and pursuant to the above specific enumerated component valuation methodologies and calculations, equals 3.35. An independent national public accounting firm with valuation expertise was retained to examine, attest and confirm ATEL 15, LLC s per Unit valuation and its component methodologies and calculation as it relates to compliance with the regulatory mandate defined in the Notice. In this regard, they examined the components of the valuation methodologies and determined them to be reasonable and within industry standards. Other component attributes, including the bases and related key assumptions of the calculation were tested for their completeness, underlying documentation support and mathematical accuracy. Upon completion of their efforts, their attestation report confirmed that the per unit valuation of ATEL 15, LLC, and the related notes, in all material respects, was based upon industry practice as described in the Manager s valuation approach.

Disclaimer The foregoing Fund per Unit valuation has been performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated value per Unit in accordance with a regulatory mandate, in order to provide the broker dealer and custodian community with a valuation on a reasonable and attested basis for use in assigning an estimation of a Unit holder s account value. Any report or disclosure of such estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by statements that the value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Unit holder were to seek to sell the Units, and that the Fund intends to liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and over the Fund s term. Further, each statement of the Fund s estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by a disclosure that there can be no assurance as to (1) when the Fund will be fully liquidated, (2) the amount the Fund may actually receive if and when the Fund seeks to liquidate its assets, (3) the amount of lease or loan payments the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, (4) the amount of asset disposition proceeds the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, and (5) the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unit holders over the course of the remaining term. Distributions The members of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement. The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of January 2012. Cash distributions were paid by the Fund to members of record as of February 28, 2022, and paid through March 31, 2022. Distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each. Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital. The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets. See the discussion in the ATEL 15, LLC Prospectus dated October 28, 2011 Prospectus under Income, Losses and Distributions Reinvestment. Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to members will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets. As net cash flows from operations are anticipated to fluctuate during the remaining life of the Fund, distributions will only be paid on an annual basis beginning with March of 2018. The amount of all future distributions is dependent upon the timing of lease payments, renewals and asset sales, which will vary during the year. Cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the leases and loans acquired. During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms. As such, all Fund periodic cash distributions made during these stages have been, and are expected in the future to be, based on the Fund s actual and anticipated gross revenues to be generated from the binding initial terms of the leases and loans acquired.

Overview ATEL 15, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on March 4, 2011 Date of Inception for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a price of 10 per Unit. As of December 21, 2011, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least 7.5 million. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on April 4, 2012, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts. The offering was terminated on October 28, 2013 with a total of 6,620,971 Units subscribed, representing contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, approximating 65.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, 6,542,557 Units were issued and outstanding. During 2012, the Company began its acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units. During the reinvestment period Reinvestment Period (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company has reinvested and will reinvest cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the members and/or utilize its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment. Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ended December 31, 2019, the Company anticipated continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations. The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated October 28, 2011 Operating Agreement ). The Company shall continue until terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Agreement. Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.

Compared to prior year, the results for 2022 primarily r e f lect an in cr e a s e in total operating r e v e n u es coupled with a decline in operating expenses.

T h e 863 thousand , o r 25 , increase i n operating r e v e n u es w as comprised of in cr e a s es in other revenues and gain on sales of operating lease assets partially offset by a decline in operating lease revenues. Other revenue increased by 875 thousand largely due to an insurance settlement related to a coal plant loading facility. Such coal plant is still fully functional and is currently under lease. G ains on sales of operating lease assets increased by 163 thousand primarily due to a change in the mix of assets sold. Partially offsetting such increases in revenues was a 175 thousand d e c l i n e in operating lease revenues, which was attributable to run-off and disposition of lease assets. Expenses Total operating expenses were 3.1 million and 4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 1.7 million, or 36 , decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to reductions in impairment losses on equipment, depreciation expense, railcar maintenance costs, storage fees and cost reimbursements to Managing Member. Impairment losses on equipment declined by 841 thousand primarily due to a prior year adjustment, of the same amount, which reduced the carrying value of certain assets deemed impaired. No such impairment was deemed

necessary for the current year. Depreciation expense decreased by 508 thousand primarily due to a 469 thousand decrease in additional depreciation recorded to reflect year-to-date changes in estimated residual values of certain equipment generating revenue under month-to-month extensions. Railcar maintenance costs decreased by 118 thousand mainly due to higher amounts of repair costs incurred in the prior year related to increased off-lease railcar inventory. In addition, storage fees decreased by 83 thousand primarily due to sales and re-leases of certain off-lease inventory; and cost reimbursements to the Managing Member decreased 81 thousand primarily due to a reduction in allocated costs reflective of the Fund s declining assets. Other loss D u r i n g t h e current year, the Comp a n y r e cord ed o t h er loss of 25 t h ou s a n d, r elat e d to unrealized losses on the fair valuation of its portfolio of equity securities and warrants. By comparison, during the prior year, the Company recorded other loss of 16 thousand, which was comprised of 37 thousand, net related to unrealized losses on the fair valuation of its portfolio of equity securities and warrants, partially offset by 21 thousand of gains realized from the sale of investment in securities.

 over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values. Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation. The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract. All lease assets are purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee. Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease. Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale. Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary. Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell (ASC 360-10-35-43). The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale. In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease. Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation. If, and when, the Company, at any time, determines that depreciation in value may have occurred with respect to an asset held-for-sale, the Company would review the value to determine whether a material reduction in value had occurred and recognize any appropriate impairment. All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below. Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred. Major additions and betterments are capitalized. Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases. The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from to . The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet. Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than past due. Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than . Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status. Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable. Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis. Pr o v isio n s f o r doubtful accounts r e lating to o pera t ing leases are incl u d e d in lease inco m e in the Co m p an y s f i n a ncial state m ents.

 Asset management fees to Managing Member per annum. The note is secured by assignments of lease payments and pledges of assets. At December 31, 2022, gross operating lease rentals totaled approximately million over the remaining lease terms and the carrying value of the pledged assets is million. The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants. The debt is secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lender on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lender has recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company. Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lender, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations. Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure. 2024 Total The non-recourse debt balance represents the remaining portion of half of a million non-recourse promissory note executed on May 20, 2019. The non-recourse promissory note was split evenly between the Fund and its affiliate, ATEL 14, LLC, and was used to pay off the senior long-term debt. The non-recourse promissory note is to be serviced by the cash flows generated under a renewed bareboat charter.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES None. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures The Company s Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Company does not control the financial reporting process, and is solely dependent on the Management of the Managing Member, who is responsible for providing the Company with financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Managing Member s disclosure controls and procedures, as they are applicable to the Company, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of the Management of the Managing Member; and (2) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 34 

Management of the Managing Member assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, Management of the Managing Member concluded that the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, was effective as of December 31, 2022. This annual report does not include an audit report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s internal control over financial reporting was not subject to audit by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which exempts non-accelerated filers from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Changes in internal control There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Based solely on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5, the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports of beneficial ownership required to be filed during or for the year ended December 31, 2022. Code of Ethics A Code of Ethics that is applicable to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Managing Member, LLC, or persons acting in such capacity on behalf of the Company, is included as Exhibit 14.1 to this report. Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The registrant has no officers or directors. Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates. The amount of such remuneration paid for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is set forth in Item 8 of this report under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Financial Statements - Related party transactions, at Note 6 thereof, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest The Company pays the Manager an annual Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4 of Gross Operating Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing. The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis. The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below. The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio. The Manager supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data. The Manager intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services. The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5 of all Company Distributions. Limitations on Fees The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations. While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines. The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines. The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. NASAA is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states. NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ). Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to 
 37 

equipment leasing program sponsors. Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund. The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ). Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interest payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Asset Management Fee Limit. The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below. To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation. To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period. Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation. Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80 of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625 for each 1 of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75 of such Gross Proceeds. The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50 of the aggregate cost of its equipment. The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875 of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment. Based on the formula in the NASAA Guidelines, the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would equal 76.875 of Gross Proceeds (80 -[50 .0625 ] = 76.875 ), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9 . The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation. The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1 for the first 2.5 of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1 for the next 2 of such excess, and 1 for each additional 1 of excess Investment in Equipment. With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875 , the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5 of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5 + 2 + 4.5 = 9 ; 1 + 1 + 4.5 = 6.5 ). At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5 of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1 of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8 per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15 of all Distributions. With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5 of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5 + 5 = 11.5 ), and 7.5 of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5 + 1 = 7.5 ), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5 of all Distributions thereafter. The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. 
 38 

Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest. If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation. The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above. A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter. See Note 6 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.

SCOPE This Code of Ethics is applicable to ATEL 15, LLC Fund 15 ), including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Managing Member, LLC AMM ), or persons acting in such capacity (collectively the Covered Officers on behalf of Fund 15, referred to herein as the Company. Accordingly, under the Securities and Exchange Commission s interpretation of its disclosure rules, the Board of Directors of the Manager of AMM, ATEL Financial Services, LLC AFS ), functions as the de facto audit committee for the Company with respect to all procedural and disclosure requirements applicable to audit committees under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The Board of Directors shall have oversight responsibility over the activities of the Company for purposes of this Code of Ethics. B. PURPOSE The Company is proud of the values with which it conducts business. It has and will continue to uphold the highest levels of business ethics and personal integrity in all types of transactions and interactions. To this end, this Code of Ethics serves to (1) emphasize the Company s commitment to ethics and compliance with the law; (2) set forth basic standards of ethical and legal behavior; (3) provide reporting mechanisms for known or suspected ethical or legal violations; and (4) help prevent and detect wrongdoing. This Code of Ethics is intended to augment and supplement the standard of ethics and business conduct expected of all Company employees, and its limitation to Covered Officers is not intended to limit the obligation of all Company employees to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity in all transactions and interactions conducted while in the Company s employ. Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide. Confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Officers should remember the Company s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek independent advice, where necessary, to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment. C. ETHICS STANDARDS 1. Honest and Ethical Conduct The Covered Officers shall behave honestly and ethically at all times and with all people. They shall act in good faith, with due care, and shall engage only in fair and open competition, by treating ethically competitors, suppliers, customers, and colleagues. They shall not misrepresent facts or engage in illegal, unethical, or anti-competitive practices for personal or professional gain. 2. Conflicts of Interest This fundamental standard of honest and ethical conduct extends to the handling of conflicts of interest. The Covered Officers shall avoid any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company, and any personal activities, investments, or associations that might give rise to such conflicts. They shall not compete with or use the Company, for personal gain, self-deal, or take advantage of any corporate opportunities. They shall act on behalf of the Company free from improper influence or the appearance of improper influence on their judgment or performance of duties. A Covered Officer shall disclose any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict to the Company s General Counsel or a member of the Company s Board of Directors. No action may be taken with respect to such transaction or party unless and until the Company s Board of Directors has approved such action. 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood, as fully disclosed in the offering documents for the Company, that AMM as managing member of the Company has certain inherent conflicts of interest. The provisions of the Company s Operating Agreement have been drafted to address the obligations, restrictions and limitations on the power and authority of AMM to manage the Company s affairs, including restrictions prohibiting or limiting the terms of any transactions in which conflicts of interest may arise. Furthermore, AMM has a fiduciary duty to the Company as its manager. It is therefore expressly understood by the Company and the Covered Officers that any and all actions by AMM and its personnel that comply with the provisions of the Company s Operating Agreement, and which are consistent with AMM s fiduciary duty to the Company, will not be considered material transactions or relationships which require disclosure or reporting under this Code of Ethics. 3. Timely and Truthful Disclosure In reports and documents filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators by the Company and in other public communications made by the Company, the Covered Officers shall make disclosures that are full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable. The Covered Officers shall provide thorough and accurate financial and accounting data for inclusion in such disclosures. The Covered Officers shall not knowingly conceal or falsify information, misrepresent material facts, or omit material facts necessary to avoid misleading the Company s independent public auditors or investors. 4. Legal Compliance In conducting the business of the Company, the Covered Officers shall comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations at all levels of government in the United States and in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Company does business, as well as applicable rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations of which the Company is a member. If the Covered Officer is unsure whether a particular action would violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation, he or she should seek the advice of inside counsel (if available), and, where necessary, outside counsel before undertaking it. D. VIOLATIONS OF ETHICAL STANDARDS 1. Reporting Known or Suspected Violations The Covered Officers will promptly bring to the attention of the Company s General Counsel or the Board of Directors any information concerning a material violation of any of the laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company and the operation of its businesses, by the Company or any agent thereof, or of violation of this Code of Ethics. The Company s General Counsel will investigate reports of violations and the findings communicated to the Company s Board of Directors. 2. Accountability for Violations If the Company s Board of Directors determines that this Code of Ethics has been violated, either directly, by failure to report a violation, or by withholding information related to a violation, it may discipline the offending Covered Officer for non-compliance with penalties up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this Code of Ethics may also constitute violations of law and may result in criminal penalties and civil liabilities for the offending Covered Officer and the Company.
