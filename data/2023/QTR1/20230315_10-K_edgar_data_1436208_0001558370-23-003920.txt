 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are predictions based on expectations and projections about future events, and are not statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning business strategy, among other things, including anticipated trends and developments in and management plans for our business and the markets in which we operate. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words, such as estimate, expect, anticipate, project, plan, intend, believe, forecast, foresee, likely, may, should, goal, target, might, will, would, can, could, predict, and continue, the negative or plural of these words and other comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are based upon information available to us as of the filing date of this Form 10-K, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. These factors include the matters discussed under Risk Factors in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 and those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and from time to time in future reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K. In this Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, Legacy, the Company, we, us or our refers to Legacy Housing Corporation, a Texas corporation. Our Company We build, sell and finance manufactured homes and tiny houses that are distributed through a network of independent retailers and company-owned stores and also sold directly to manufactured home communities. The company was founded in 2005 as a Texas limited partnership named Legacy Housing, Ltd. Effective January 1, 2018, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Legacy Housing Corporation. Effective December 31, 2019, we converted from a Delaware corporation to a Texas corporation. Our corporate office is located in Bedford, Texas (between Dallas and Fort Worth). We completed our initial public offering (the IPO in December 2018 and our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol LEGH. We are the fifth largest producer of manufactured homes in the United States as ranked by number of homes manufactured based on information available from the Manufactured Housing Institute and IBTS for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2022. With current operations focused primarily in the southern United States, we offer our customers an array of quality homes ranging in size from approximately 395 to 2,667 square feet consisting of 1 to 5 bedrooms, with 1 to 3 1 / 2 bathrooms. Our homes range in price, at retail, from approximately 33,000 to 180,000. During 2022, we sold 4,189 home sections (which are entire modules or single floors) and in 2021 we sold 3,635 home sections. We commenced operations in 2005 and have experienced strong sales growth since our inception. Our homes address the significant need in the United States for affordable housing. This need for affordable housing is being driven by a nationwide trend of increasing rental rates for housing, higher prices for site-built homes and decreasing percentages of home ownership among portions of the U.S. population. Our customers typically have annual household incomes of less than 75,000 and include young and working class families, as well as persons age 55 and older. In 2021, there were approximately 68,619,000 households in the United States with annual household incomes of less than 75,000, representing 52 of all U.S. households, according to the Current Population Survey published by the U.S. Census Bureau. We believe our company is one of the most vertically integrated in the manufactured housing industry, allowing us to offer a complete solution to our customers, from manufacturing custom-made homes using quality materials and distributing those homes through our expansive network of independent retailers and company-owned distribution locations, to providing tailored financing solutions for our customers. Our homes are constructed in the United States at

 one of our three manufacturing facilities in accordance with the construction and safety standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD ). Our factories employ high-volume production techniques that allow us to produce approximately 70 home sections, or approximately 60 fully-completed homes on average depending on product mix, in total per week. We use quality materials and operate our own component manufacturing facilities for many of the items used in the construction of our homes. Each home can be configured according to a variety of floor plans and equipped with such features as fireplaces, central air conditioning and state-of-the-art kitchens. Our homes are marketed under our premier Legacy brand name and, as of December 31, 2022, are sold to consumers, primarily across 15 states through a network of 156 independent retail locations, 13 company-owned retail locations and through direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. Our 13 company-owned retail locations, including 11 Heritage Housing stores and two Tiny House Outlet stores, exclusively sell our homes. During 2022, approximately 53 of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 9 in Georgia, 5 in Florida, 5 in Alabama, 5 in Arizona and 4 in Louisiana. During 2021, approximately 50 of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 16 in Georgia, 8 in Louisiana and 5 in Alabama. We offer three types of financing solutions to our customers. We provide floor plan financing for our independent retailers, which takes the form of a consignment arrangement or a financed sale between the retailer and us. We also provide consumer financing for our products which are sold to end-users through both independent and company-owned retail locations, and we provide financing solutions to manufactured housing community owners that buy our products for use in their housing communities. Our ability to offer competitive financing options at our retail locations provides us with several competitive advantages and allows us to capture sales which may not have otherwise occurred without our ability to offer consumer financing. Corporate Conversion Prior to January 1, 2018, we were a Texas limited partnership named Legacy Housing, Ltd. Effective January 1, 2018, we converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion, or the Corporate Conversion, and changed our name to Legacy Housing Corporation. All of our outstanding partnership interests were converted on a proportional basis into shares of common stock of Legacy Housing Corporation. The conversion qualified as a tax free transaction under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective December 31, 2019, the Company reincorporated from a Delaware corporation to a Texas corporation. Following the Corporate Conversion, Legacy Housing Corporation continues to hold all of the property and assets of Legacy Housing, Ltd. and all of the debts and obligations of Legacy Housing, Ltd. continue as the debts and obligations of Legacy Housing Corporation. The purpose of the Corporate Conversion was to reorganize our corporate structure so that the top-tier entity in our corporate structure, the entity that offered common stock to the public in the IPO, was a corporation rather than a limited partnership. Except as otherwise noted, the financial statements included in this Form 10-K are those of Legacy Housing Corporation.

 Our Market Opportunity Manufactured housing is a competitive alternative to other forms of affordable housing, whether new or existing, or located in urban, suburban or rural areas. We believe the target universe of manufactured home buyers consists of households with total annual income below 75,000 which comprised 52 of total U.S. households in 2021. We believe our target U.S. age group is wide ranging from young families who are often first time homebuyers to older homebuyers who may be downsizing or moving towards a more rural lifestyle. The comparatively low all-in cost of fully-equipped manufactured housing is attractive to our target consumers. The chart below highlights the increasing all-in average sales price per square foot difference between a new manufactured home and a new site-built home (excluding land).

 Manufactured homes are an attractive alternative for consumers as new single-family home prices continue to rise at a rapid rate. As shown in the chart below, there is a growing gap between the average sale price for new single-family homes (including the land on which they were built) and the price of the average manufactured home; management sees this gap as an opportunity for the industry.

 Additionally, innovative engineering and design, as well as efficient production techniques, including the advent and development of the tiny house market, continue to position manufactured homes as a viable housing alternative. Demand for high-quality affordable housing below 150,000 has also been driven by increasing rental rates for housing, higher prices for site-built homes, decreasing percentages of home ownership among portions of the U.S. population and stagnant U.S. wage growth.

 The manufactured housing industry shipped 112,882 and 105,772 manufactured homes in 2022 and 2021, respectively, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Manufactured housing shipments have increased by 22 over the past five years and represent approximately 8 of total completed privately owned housing units. 

 Source: U.S. Census Bureau Our Competitive Advantages We offer a complete solution for affordable manufactured housing. We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition and have been able to grow our business as a result of the following key competitive strengths: Quality and Variety of Housing Designs. Based on more than 80 combined years of industry experience, our co-founders have developed an operating model that enables the efficient production of quality, customizable manufactured homes. All of our homes are constructed in one of our three U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. By utilizing an assembly-line process that employs from approximately 150 to 275 individuals per facility, we are able to manufacture a home in approximately three to six days and, are on average producing approximately 70 home sections, or 60 fully-completed homes depending on product mix, in total per week. We utilize local market research to design homes that meet the specific needs of our customers and offer a variety of structural and decorative customization options, including, among others,

 fireplaces, central air conditioning, overhead heat ducts, stipple-textured ceilings, decorative woodgrain vinyl floors, wood cabinetry and energy conservation elements. Additionally, our homes have vaulted ceilings in every room, have numerous proprietary advantages such as our copyrighted furniture friendly floor plans and, in most cases, are wider, have taller ceilings and a steeper roof pitch than our competitors products. Taken together, we believe our ability to offer our customers a range of home sizes and styles, as well as sophisticated design and customization, allows us to accommodate virtually all reasonable customer requests. Our vertical integration allows us the ability to respond quickly to our customers needs and modify designs during the construction process. Manufacturing Facilities Strategically Located Near Customers in Key Markets. Our three manufacturing facilities are strategically located to allow us to serve our 156 independent and 13 company-owned retail locations primarily across 15 states. Currently, we have a manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas that measures 97,000 square feet in size and produced 1,082 homes in 2022 and 1,095 homes in 2021, a manufacturing plant in Commerce, Texas that measures 130,000 square feet in size and produced 946 homes in 2022 and 732 homes in 2021, and a manufacturing plant in Eatonton, Georgia that measures 388,000 square feet in size and produced 913 homes in 2022 and 1,046 homes in 2021. Once our homes are constructed and equipped at our facilities, we have the ability to transport the finished products directly to customers ensuring timely and efficient delivery of our manufactured homes. We currently have approximately 52 company-owned trucks, which transported approximately 79 of our production during 2022 to manufactured home communities, our company-owned retail locations and independent dealers. Expansive and Growing Distribution Network. We distribute our products primarily in the southern United States through a network of independent retail locations, company-owned retail locations and direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. Our first company-owned retail location opened in June 2016. We believe our company-owned stores will, on average, carry higher gross margins. Competitive Production Strategies and Direct Sourcing. We develop and maintain the resources necessary to build custom homes efficiently that incorporate unique and varied customer-requested features. We are constantly seeking ways in which to directly source materials to be used in the manufacturing process, which allows us to ensure the materials are of high-quality and can be customized to meet our customers needs. Customization enables us to attract additional retailers and consumers who seek individualized homes that are assembled on a factory production line. When these custom homes are sold through company-owned retail stores, we expect to capture higher gross margins. Available Financing for our Dealers and Retail Customers. Our financial position allows us to develop and offer financing solutions to our customers in connection with their purchase of our homes. We offer three types of financing solutions to our customers. We provide floor plan financing for our independent retailers, which takes the form of a consignment arrangement between the retailer and us. We also provide consumer financing for our products sold to end-users through both independent and our company-owned retail locations, and we provide financing to community owners that buy our products for use in their rental housing communities. Our company has been providing floor plan financing to our independent retailers since our formation and we now have 156 independent retailers using our consignment solution. We now have more than 3,400 retail customers that purchased their homes utilizing our retail financing solutions. Support for Owners of Manufactured Home Communities. We provide manufacturing and financing solutions for owners of manufactured home communities in connection with the development of communities in our geographic market area. Such development projects can vary, but generally include custom park development financing and large purchase orders of manufactured homes. We also make loans to community owners for the purpose of acquiring or developing properties and, as part of the arrangement, these community owners contract to buy homes from us. These financing solutions are structured to give us an attractive return on investment, when coupled with the gross margin we realize on products specifically targeted for these new manufactured housing communities.

 Strong Alignment of Interests through Co-Founders Ownership. We believe that a strong alignment of interests with stockholders and investors exists through the ownership of a significant percentage of our outstanding shares by our co-founders, Curtis D. Hodgson (Executive Chairman of the Board) and Kenneth E. Shipley (Executive Vice President and Director). Messrs. Hodgson and Shipley acquired their ownership in 2005 when they founded the company. Each individual has received a minimal annual salary 50,000). Messr. Shipley continues to receive a minimal annual salary 50,000). In January 2022, Messr. Hodgson entered into an amended and restated employment agreement which provides him with an annual salary of 200,000 and a signing bonus of 150,000 shares of restricted stock, which vested upon grant. Under this new agreement, he is also eligible for an annual incentive bonus and equity awards. By providing structural and economic alignment with the performance of our company, Messrs. Hodgson s and Shipley s continuing controlling interests are directly aligned with those of our investors. We believe the combination of these characteristics has promoted long-term planning, an enhanced culture among our customers, strategic partners and employees, and ultimately the creation of value for our investors. 
 Our Growth Strategy We have a strong operating history of investing in successful growth initiatives over the past 18 years. We believe that the solution we are able to provide for our customers, as a result of the vertical integration of our company, enhances our brand recognition as a leading producer, results in higher and more efficient utilization of our manufacturing factories and expands our direct-to-consumer outreach on the competitive advantages of our wide variety of customizable homes. This operational focus has provided us with sustainable net sales and net income growth over the years. Our growth strategy includes the following key initiatives: Expand Financing Solutions for Our Customers. We recognize that offering financing solutions to our customers is an important component of being a vertically integrated company that provides affordable manufactured housing. Providing financing improves our responsiveness to the needs of prospective purchasers while also providing us with opportunities for interest and servicing revenues, which act as additional drivers of net income for us. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we financed approximately 45 and 46 of the homes we sold to customers, respectively. We intend to expand financing and leasing solutions to manufactured housing community-owner customers, in a manner that includes developing new sites for products in or near urban locations where there is a shortage of sites to place our products. Continue to Focus on Innovation and Customization for Core Customer Groups. Our production strategy is focused on continually developing the resources necessary to efficiently build homes that incorporate unique, varied and innovative customer preferences. We are constantly seeking ways to directly source materials to be used in the manufacturing process, which allows us to ensure we have quality materials that can be customized to meet our customers needs. Our principal focus is on designing and building highly functional and durable products that appeal to families of all sizes. Seek Additional Agreements with Owners of Manufactured Home Communities. Community housing developments provide us with large, concentrated sales opportunities. These projects vary in size and density but generally include sales of 30 to 300 homes. We believe there are significant growth opportunities to work with our development partners on such projects and view these opportunities as an important driver for both the sale of more homes and for financing bulk purchases of those homes by community owners. Pursue Selective Development Opportunites. We seek to grow through selective acquisition of developable land in proximity to our manufacturing footprint which will serve as a future revenue stream for the underlying land as well as ensuring high utilization of our expertise in manufacturing and distribution. In April 2018, we acquired approximately 420 acres of raw land located in Bastrop County near Austin, Texas for 4.2 million. In November 2018, we acquired approximately 69 acres of raw land located near Adkins, Texas for 0.8 million. In July and August 2019, we acquired approximately 140 acres of raw land in Johnson County, Texas for 0.9 million. In September 2020, we acquired 
 9 

Table of Contents 
 approximately 80 acres of raw land in Wise County, Texas for 0.9 million. In February 2021, we acquired approximately 233 acres of raw land in Bexar County, Texas for 1.6 million. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop the remaining land, or to provide financing to third party developers of additional manufactured housing communities in order to provide locations for manufactured homes for our customers. Management estimates that our land holdings will yield approximately 3000 manufactured home pad sites. Focus on our Retail Process. As of December 31, 2022, we distribute our products primarily across 15 states through a combination of 13 company-owned retail locations and 156 independent retail locations. We believe that a focused network of company-owned retail locations will allow us to be more responsive and improve the customer experience at all stages, from manufacturing and design to sales, financing and customer service. We believe our company-owned stores will, on average, carry higher gross margins due to our ability to select critical markets and develop highly-trained sales representatives who possess a deep understanding of our business and customer needs. 
 Our Products Overview. We are the fifth largest producer of manufactured homes in the United States as ranked by number of homes manufactured based on information available from the Manufactured Housing Institute and IBTS for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2022. We produce a wide variety of homes that can be used by our customers in a number of ways. We build a variety of sizes and floor plans of residential homes and tiny houses. We work collaboratively with our partners to meet diverse housing needs, such as residences on privately-owned land and in manufactured home communities, recreational and vacation properties, such as hunting cabins, and accommodations for workforces in oilfields and other industries. Manufacturing and Quality Design. We utilize local market research to design homes that meet the specific requirements of our customers and our homes are designed after extensive field research and consumer feedback. We frequently introduce new floor plans, decor, exterior design, features and accessories to appeal to changing consumer trends and we offer an assortment of customizations to match each customer s individual tastes. Each home typically contains a living room, dining area, kitchen, 1 to 5 bedrooms and 1 to 3 1 / 2 bathrooms, and each home can be customized to include certain features including, among others, fireplaces, central air conditioning, mini-split climate control, overhead heat ducts, stipple-textured ceilings, decorative wood grain vinyl floors, wood cabinetry and energy conservation elements. The manufactured homes we build are constructed in accordance with the construction and safety standards of HUD. Our Texas factories are certified to build homes according to the Texas Industrialized Housing and Buildings law (known as the Texas Modular Code) and our Georgia factory is certified to build homes according to Georgia state construction codes. In addition to traditional manufactured homes, we offer a diverse assortment of tiny houses, which are recreational structures between 320 and 399 square feet in size that are used as temporary dwellings, can be pulled by a pick-up truck and are generally aesthetically similar to larger homes. Our tiny houses are built in a variety of models and floor plans and typically range from 1 to 3 bedrooms with 1 to 2 bathrooms. Tiny houses do not need to be built to HUD standards. Manufacturing Process. Our manufactured homes are entirely constructed and equipped at our three factories. Our homes are constructed using high-volume production techniques and employ approximately 150 to 275 employees at each facility. Most of our homes are constructed in one or more sections (or floors) on a steel chassis. Each section is assembled in stages beginning with the construction of the chassis, followed by the addition of other constructed and purchased components and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the production process and the benefits of constructing homes in a controlled factory environment enable us to produce homes in less time, generating less waste and at a lower cost per-square-foot than traditional home building. The finished home is then transported directly to a customer at a retail sales center, work site or manufactured home community. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we sold 4,189 and 3,635 home sections, including 139 and 230 tiny houses, respectively.

 Manufacturing Facilities. We currently operate three manufacturing facilities located in Fort Worth, Texas, Commerce, Texas and Eatonton, Georgia, each of which range in size from approximately 97,000 to 388,000 square feet. The production schedules for our manufacturing facilities are based on wholesale orders received from distributors, which fluctuate from week to week. In general, our facilities are structured to operate on one 8- to 9-hour shift per day, five days per week. We currently manufacture a typical home in approximately three to six production days. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we produced, on average, approximately 70 home sections per week, or 60 fully-completed homes. Raw Materials and Suppliers. The principal materials used in the production of our manufactured homes include wood, wood products, steel, aluminum, gypsum wallboard, windows, doors, fiberglass insulation, carpet, vinyl, fasteners, plumbing materials, appliances and electrical items. We currently buy these materials from various third-party manufacturers and distributors. We procure multiple sources of supplies for all key materials in order to mitigate any supply chain risk. We intend to continue seeking greater direct sourcing of materials from original manufacturers. This will allow us to save costs, gain greater control over the quality of the materials we use in our products and increase customization to meet our customers changing preferences. The inability to obtain any materials used in the production of our homes, whether resulting from material shortages, limitation of supplier facilities or other events affecting production of component parts, may affect our ability to meet or maintain production requirements. Pricing and availability of certain raw materials were volatile during 2022 and 2021 due to a number of factors in th e economic environment. We continue to monitor and react to inflation in these materials by maintaining a focus on our product pricing in response to higher materials costs. Warranties. We provide the retail home buyer with a one-year limited warranty from the date of purchase covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure, plumbing and electrical systems. Our warranty does not extend to installation and setup of the home, which is generally arranged by the retailer. Appliances, carpeting, roofing and similar items are warranted by their original manufacturer for various lengths of time. At this time, we do not provide any warranties with respect to tiny houses. Distribution As of December 31, 2022, we distribute our manufactured homes primarily across 15 states through a network of 156 independent retail locations, 13 company-owned retail locations and direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. As is common in the industry, our independent distributors typically sell manufactured homes produced by other manufacturers in addition to our manufactured homes. Additionally, some independent retailers operate multiple sales outlets. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no independent retailer accounted for 10 or more of our manufacturing sales.

 Below is a list of the states in which we sold most of our manufactured homes and the approximate percentage of those sales to our total product sales:

We continually seek to increase our wholesale shipments by growing sales at our existing independent retailers and by finding new independent retailers to sell our homes. We provide comprehensive sales training to retail sales associates and bring them to our manufacturing facilities for product training and to view new product designs as they are developed. These training seminars facilitate the sale of our homes by increasing the skill and knowledge of the retail sales consultants. Additionally, we display our products at trade shows and support our retailers through the distribution of floor plan literature, brochures, decor selection displays and point of sale promotional material, as well as internet-based marketing assistance. We believe we have the most comprehensive printed catalog of manufactured housing products in the industry. Our independent retailers generally either pay cash to purchase inventory or finance their inventory needs through our consignment arrangements or financed sales. Certain of our independent retailers finance a portion of their inventory through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third parties. In such cases, we verify the order with the third party, then manufacture the home and ship it to the retailer. Payment is due from the third-party lender upon shipment of the product to the retailer and, depending on the terms of each arrangement, we may or may not have limited repurchase obligations associated with this inventory. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately 8,925,000 and 4,908,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Approximately 63 of our 2022 product sales were attributable to our independent retail distributors, 9 to our company-owned retail locations and 29 directly to owners of manufactured housing communities. Approximately 57 of our 2021 product sales were attributable to our independent retail distributors, 13 to our company-owned retail locations and 30 directly to owners of manufactured housing communities. As of December 31, 2022, we operate 13 company-owned retail locations. Our company-owned locations allow us to improve the customer experience through all steps of the buying process, from manufacturing and design to sales, financing and customer service. This also gives us a direct window into consumer preferences and lending opportunities. We believe that our company-owned stores will, on average, be more productive than our independent retail locations and carry higher gross margins.

 Sales and Marketing Our corporate marketing efforts focus on increasing our brand awareness and communicating our commitment to quality along with the many other competitive advantages our company offers. Our marketing strategy is to offer several lines of manufactured homes that appeal to a wide range of home buyers, continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our products. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including digital advertising, email marketing, social media and affiliate marketing, as well as through various strategic partnerships. We maintain our website at www.legacyhousingcorp.com. Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on households with annual incomes of less than 60,000 which includes young families, working class families and persons age 50 and older. We also market to other types of customers, including owners of manufactured home communities, buyers interested in tiny houses, recreational buyers and houses for workforces or man-camp housing. Additionally, we continue to be well-positioned to react to any increase in demand for affordable, quickly-delivered manufactured homes as a result of unforeseen harsh weather conditions and similar events. All of our customers are located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales. Financing Solutions for Our Customers We offer three types of financing solutions: Floor Plan Financing. We consign inventory or provide wholesale financing to our independent retailers. Consumer Financing. We provide consumer financing for our products sold to end-users through both independent and our company-owned retail locations. Manufactured Housing Community Financing. We provide financing to community owners that buy or lease our products for use in their rental housing communities. Floor Plan Financing. We provide floor plan or wholesale financing for most of our independent retailers for products we manufacture and for pre-owned products. This wholesale financing is a consignment from us to our independent retailers. The retailers pay their own freight and pay us a monthly fee ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 per month of the wholesale invoice amount of the home. They are also obligated to pay 1,000 toward the invoice amount each year after the consignment with the first 1,000 reduction due one year following consignment. During 2022, we collected 3,370,000 from the independent retailers. Upon sale, the independent retailer is obligated to pay us the invoice amount, less any prepaid reductions, prior to moving the home away from their retail location. If they provide certain documentation to us, we allow them to move the home to their customer s location and we notify the customer s lending source to pay us the amount due upon funding of the loan. We have proprietary technology that we install in many consigned homes that gives us the ability to determine if a consigned home has been moved from the retail location without permission. The independent dealer is free to terminate the consignment agreement by giving us 90-days advance notice if it is current on all its obligations to us. Our wholesale consignment contracts require us to defer income recognition until we are paid in full. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded consignment sales of 84,037,000 and 63,496,000, respectively. Consignment sales are recorded when a house under one of our consignment agreements is sold to the end consumer. Certain of our wholesale factory-built housing sales to independent retailers are purchased through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution under which we are obligated, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which is typically 24 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail

 customer. The maximum amount of contingent obligations under our repurchase agreements (without reduction for the resale value of the homes) as of December 31, 2022 was 8,925,000. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. We carry no reserve for this contingent liability.

Principal Average Amount Number of Contractual Rate Remaining Outstanding Loans or Monthly Fee Term Consumer Financing 142,340 3,405 13.4 average contractual rate 124 months MHP Community Financing 144,321 545 8.1 average contractual rate 48 months We also offer inventory floor plan financing to retailers that takes the form of a consignment arrangement. As of December 31, 2022, we had 5,132,000 of inventory under consignment to our retailers. Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: (i) chattel or personal property loans, for purchasers of a home without any underlying land involved (generally HUD code homes), (ii) non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of a home and the land on which the home is placed, and (iii) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration FHA ), Veterans Affairs or GSE loans. At the present time, we currently offer only chattel loans. We provide retail consumer financing to consumers who purchase our full-size manufactured homes and tiny houses and dealer incentive arrangements to encourage independent retailers to use our financing product. Under these arrangements, once a customer executes a home purchase agreement with Legacy financing, we pay to the retailer 80 of the retailer s gross margin through these consignment arrangements and we retain 20 of the retail gross margins in the consignment portfolio. We transfer the consigned value of the home to the consignment portfolio as our contribution to the consignment arrangement. The retailer is obligated to remarket any repossessions associated with consignment transactions, and obtain 90 of the outstanding balance on the home at the time of repossession. We charge each dealer in the consignment arrangement fees for servicing the loans and receive a preferred return of 10 to 12 per annum for amounts we invest. Upon payback of our contribution, fees and preferred returns, we split the remaining balance with the independent retailer according to a negotiated formula which is accounted for as the dealer incentive liability. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 3,405 retail consumer loans with an average principal balance of 38,891. Our average remaining term on these loans as of December 31, 2022 was 124 months and the average percentage rate (APR) of interest was 13.4 . Our average loan-to-value LTV at the time of loan origination, which is based on the gross sales price to the borrower, was 83 for the consumer financing portfolio as of December 31, 2022. We have not financed, and have no current plans to finance, new homes manufactured by our competitors in the ordinary course of our business. All loan applications go through an underwriting process conducted at our corporate headquarters to evaluate credit risk that takes into account numerous factors including the down payment, FICO score, monthly income, and total housing payment coverage of the borrower. The interest rates on approved loans are determined by a buyer s credit score and down payment amount. We use payment history to monitor the credit quality of the consumer loans on an ongoing basis. Manufactured Housing Community Financing. We provide financing to owners of manufactured housing communities for our products that they buy in order to rent to their residents. These loans generally have a ten-year term and can have a fixed or variable interest rate. Approximately 97 of the these loans have a fixed interest rate ranging from 6.9 to 11.5 . The remaining loans bear interest at the prime rate plus 4 , with a floor and a ceiling. Down payments, delivery expenses and installation expenses are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. As of December 31, 2022

 and 2021, loans outstanding from manufactured home communities totaled 143,253,000 and 102,992,000, which comprised 545 and 530 loans, respectively. Our average remaining term on these loans was approximately four years and six years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also make loans to community owners for the purpose of acquiring or developing properties and, as part of the arrangement, these community owners contract to buy homes from us. These loans typically range in term from two to five years and carry interest at 5.00 to 12.0 . For the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated loans to owners of manufactured home communities for lot development purposes with a total amount of 4,010,000. Competition The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels, with competition based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, promotion, merchandising and the terms of retail and wholesale consumer financing. We compete with other producers of manufactured homes and new producers continue to enter the market. We also compete with companies offering for sale homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers and we compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses and condominiums. In addition to our company, there are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the United States, including Clayton Homes, Inc., Cavco Industries, Inc. and Skyline Champion Corporation. Certain of these competitors possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than we do. For the past 17 years, the industry has experienced a trend towards consolidation and, as a result, the bulk of the market share is controlled by a small number of companies. We are the country s fifth largest producer of manufactured homes. Accordingly, we believe we have a significant opportunity to expand in this industry by effectively growing our market share. Among lenders to manufactured home buyers, there are significant competitors including national, regional and local banks, independent finance companies, mortgage brokers and mortgage banks such as 21st Mortgage Corporation, an affiliate of Clayton Homes, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Triad Finance Corporation and CU Factory Built Lending, LP. Certain of these competitors are larger than us and have access to substantially more capital and cost efficiencies. Protection of Proprietary Technology We rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary information, technology and brands. We protect our proprietary information and technology, in part, by requiring certain of our employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. We also may enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with certain of our technical consultants to protect our confidential and proprietary information and technology. We cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants will not be breached, that we will be able to effectively enforce these agreements, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements, or that our trade secrets and other proprietary information and technology will not be disclosed or will otherwise be protected. Our intellectual property includes copyrights issued by the U.S. Copyright Office for many of our floor plans. We are not currently aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our intellectual property rights. Government Regulation General. Our company operates in a regulated industry, and there are many federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations that impact our business. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines, the entry of injunctions or both. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with all applicable laws and enforcement policies.

 Federal Manufactured Homes Regulations. Our manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. Construction of manufactured housing is governed by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, and the regulations issued under such act by HUD. The HUD regulations, known collectively as the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, cover all aspects of manufactured home construction, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. Our Texas manufacturing facilities, and the plans and specifications of the HUD-compliant homes they produce, have been approved by a HUD-certified inspection agency. Further, an independent HUD-certified third-party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with HUD regulations during construction. Failure to comply with applicable HUD regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities. We believe our manufactured homes are in substantial compliance with all present HUD requirements. Manufactured homes are typically built with wood products that contain formaldehyde resins. HUD regulates the allowable concentrations of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and requires manufacturers to warn purchasers as to formaldehyde-associated risks. The Environmental Protection Agency EPA and other governmental agencies have in the past evaluated the effects of formaldehyde. We use materials in our manufactured homes that meet HUD standards for formaldehyde emissions and believe we comply with HUD and other applicable government regulations in this regard. Transportation and Zoning Regulations. The transportation of manufactured homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities. Such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements. Our manufactured homes (including our tiny houses) are also subject to local zoning and housing regulations. In certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold, local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately-owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities. Such ordinances and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect. A number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes. Utility connections are subject to state and local regulations which must be complied with by the retailer or other person installing the home. Warranty Regulations. Certain warranties we issue may be subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, which regulates the descriptions of warranties on consumer products. For example, warranties that are subject to the act must be included in a single easy-to-read document that is generally made available prior to purchase. The act also prohibits certain attempts to disclaim or modify implied warranties and the use of deceptive or misleading terms. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations. A number of states require manufactured home producers to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims. Financial Services Regulations. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated under that act require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit. The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated under that act prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X promulgated under that act require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements. The Federal Trade Commission has adopted or proposed various Trade Regulation Rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers claims and defenses. Installment sales contracts, direct loans and mortgage loans eligible for inclusion in a Ginnie Mae program are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the FHA. The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act provides assistance for the housing industry, including manufactured homes, including, among other things, increased loan limits for chattel (home-only Title I) loans. Recent FHA guidelines provide Ginnie Mae the ability to securitize manufactured home FHA Title I loans to allow lenders to obtain new capital, which can then be used to fund new loans for our customers. The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act established requirements for the licensing and registration of all individuals that are Mortgage Loan Originators MLOs ). Traditionally, manufactured housing retailers have assisted home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes, including negotiating rates and the terms for their loans. Under the act, however, these activities are prohibited unless performed by a 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 registered or licensed MLO. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to financing documents. Regulation C of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, among other things, requires certain financial institutions, including non-depository institutions, to collect, record, report and disclose information about their mortgage lending activity, which is used to identify potential discriminatory lending patterns and enforce anti-discrimination statutes. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed into law and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services. Certain CFPB mortgage finance rules apply to consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, including real property mortgages and chattel loans secured by manufactured homes. These rules, among other things, define standards for origination of Qualified Mortgages, establish specific requirements for lenders to prove borrowers ability to repay, outline conditions under which Qualified Mortgages are subject to safe harbor limitations on liability to borrowers and establish interest rates and other cost parameters for determining which Qualified Mortgages fall under safe harbor protection. While many manufactured homes are financed with agency-conforming mortgages in which the ability to repay is verified, and interest rates and other costs are within the safe harbor limits, a significant amount of loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes, particularly chattel loans and non-conforming land-home loans, fall outside such safe harbors. Additionally, the CFPB rules, among other things, amended the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act by expanding the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 HOEPA and imposing additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain manufactured home loans are now subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed High Cost Mortgages and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of manufactured homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered High Cost Mortgages under these rules and while some lenders may offer loans that are deemed High Cost Mortgages, the rate and fee limits may deter some lenders from offering such loans to borrowers or be reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. Additionally, certain CFPB rules apply to appraisals on principal residences securing higher-priced mortgage loans. Certain loans secured by manufactured homes, primarily chattel loans, could be considered higher-priced mortgage loans. Among other things, the rules require creditors to provide copies of appraisal reports to borrowers prior to loan closing. Compliance with the regulations may constrain lenders ability to profitably price certain loans or may cause lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls and infrastructure and may cause some lenders to curtail underwriting certain loans altogether. Furthermore, some investors may be reluctant to participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure necessary financing. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect our earnings, limit our access to capital and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Reform Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act revises portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, reduces the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions, including eliminating provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 SAFE Act ), and protects consumer access to credit. With the elimination of certain provisions of the SAFE Act, manufactured housing retailers can now assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they may not assist in negotiating the financing terms. This will enable buyers to more easily find access to financing and make the overall home buying experience smoother. On January 25, 2018, HUD announced a top-to-bottom review of its manufactured housing rules as part of a broader effort to identify regulations that may be ineffective, overly burdensome, or excessively costly given the critical need for affordable housing. If certain changes are made, our company may be able to more effectively serve buyers of affordable homes. In 2017, our lead lender required an extensive review of our retail installment contract and associated procedures, which we use as part of our consumer financing solutions strategy. Based on that review, we improved certain elements of the language used in our contracts, and modified certain aspects of our practices. Although we believe there are no material compliance issues with our forms and procedures, we are subject to the federal and other regulations described above.

 December 2016, the Company entered into a Payment in Lieu of Taxes PILOT agreement commonly offered in Georgia by local community development programs to encourage industry development. The net effect of the PILOT agreement is to provide the Company with incentives through the abatement of local, city and county property taxes and to provide financing for improvements to the Company s Georgia plant (the Project ). In connection with the PILOT agreement, the Putman County Development Authority provided a credit facility for up to 10,000 which could have been drawn upon to fund Project improvements and capital expenditures as defined in the agreement. If funds had been drawn, the Company would have paid transactions costs and debt service payments. The PILOT agreement required interest payments of 6.00 per annum on outstanding balances, which would have been due each December 1st through maturity on December 1, 2021, at which time all unpaid principal and interest would have been due. The PILOT agreement was collateralized by the assets of the Project. No amounts were drawn on this credit facility. We currently operate 13 retail locations. Each retail location sits on approximately five to seven acres of land. We lease 9 of the 13 retail locations we operate in the business, pursuant to leases expiring from 2023 to 2028. Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 713,000 and 698,000, respectively. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are party to certain legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and are incidental to our business. Certain of the claims pending against us allege, among other things, breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranties, construction defects, deceptive trade practices, product liability and personal injury. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to management, will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes and the information contained in other sections of this Form 10-K. It contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and is based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by our management in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in this Form 10-K and in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, particularly under the heading Risk Factors. Overview Legacy Housing Corporation builds, sells and finances manufactured homes and tiny houses that are distributed through a network of independent retailers and company-owned stores and are sold directly to manufactured housing communities. We are the fifth largest producer of manufactured homes in the United States as ranked by number of homes manufactured based on information available from the Manufactured Housing Institute and IBTS for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2022. With current operations focused primarily in the southern United States, we offer our customers an array of quality homes ranging in size from approximately 395 to 2,667 square feet consisting of 1 to 5 bedrooms, with 1 to 3 1 / 2 bathrooms. Our homes range in price, at retail, from approximately 33,000 to 180,000. During 2022, we sold 4,189 home sections (which are entire homes or single floors that are combined to create complete homes) and in 2021, we sold 3,635 home sections. The Company has one reportable segment. All of our activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on how each of the activities of Company supports the others. For example, the sale of manufactured homes includes providing transportation and consignment arrangements with dealers. We also provide financing options to the customers to facilitate such sale of homes. In addition, the sale of homes is directly related to financing provided by us. Accordingly, all significant operating and strategic decisions by the chief operating decision-maker, the Executive Chairman of the Board, are based upon analyses of our company as one segment or unit. We believe our company is one of the most vertically integrated in the manufactured housing industry, allowing us to offer a complete solution to our customers, from manufacturing custom-made homes using quality materials and distributing those homes through our expansive network of independent retailers and company-owned distribution locations, to providing tailored financing solutions for our customers. Our homes are constructed in the United States at one of our three manufacturing facilities in accordance with the construction and safety standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD ). Our factories employ high-volume production techniques that allow us to produce, on average, approximately 70 home sections, or 60 fully-completed homes depending on product mix, in total per week. We use quality materials and operate our own component manufacturing facilities for many of the items used in the construction of our homes. Each home can be configured according to a variety of floor plans and equipped with such features as fireplaces, central air conditioning and state-of-the-art kitchens. Our homes are marketed under our premier Legacy brand name and currently are sold primarily across 15 states through a network of 156 independent retail locations, 13 company-owned retail locations and through direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. Our 13 company-owned retail locations, including 11 Heritage Housing stores and two Tiny House Outlet stores exclusively sell our homes. During 2022, approximately 53 of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 9 in Georgia, 5 in Florida, 5 in Alabama, 5 in Arizona and 4 in Louisiana. During 2021, approximately 50 of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 16 in Georgia, 8 in Louisiana and 5 in Alabama. We offer three types of financing solutions to our customers. We provide floor plan financing for our independent retailers, which takes the form of a consignment arrangement or a financed sale between the retailer and us. We also provide consumer financing for our products which are sold to end-users through both independent and company-owned retail locations, and we provide financing solutions to manufactured housing community owners that buy our products for use in their manufactured housing communities. Our ability to offer competitive financing options

 at our retail locations provides us with several competitive advantages and allows us to capture sales which may not have otherwise occurred without our ability to offer consumer financing. Corporate Conversion Prior to January 1, 2018, we were a Texas limited partnership named Legacy Housing, Ltd. Effective January 1, 2018, we converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion, or the Corporate Conversion, and changed our name to Legacy Housing Corporation. All of our outstanding partnership interests were converted on a proportional basis into shares of common stock of Legacy Housing Corporation. Effective December 31, 2019, the Company reincorporated from a Delaware corporation to a Texas corporation. For more information, see Corporate Conversion in Note 1. Following the Corporate Conversion, Legacy Housing Corporation continues to hold all of the property and assets of Legacy Housing, Ltd. and all of the debts and obligations of Legacy Housing, Ltd. continue as the debts and obligations of Legacy Housing Corporation. The purpose of the Corporate Conversion was to reorganize our corporate structure so that the top-tier entity in our corporate structure is a corporation rather than a limited partnership and so that our existing owners own shares of our common stock rather than partnership interests in a limited partnership. Except as otherwise noted, the financial statements included in this Form 10-K are those of Legacy Housing Corporation. Factors Affecting Our Performance We believe that the growth of our business and our future success depend on various opportunities, challenges, trends and other factors, including the following: We have purchased several properties in our market area for the purpose of developing manufactured housing communities and subdivisions. As of December 31, 2022, these properties include the following s in thousands): 

Location Description Date of Acquisition Land Improvements Total Bastrop County, Texas 368 Acres April 2018 4,215 3,381 7,596 Bexar County, Texas 69 Acres November 2018 842 107 949 Horseshoe Bay, Texas 133 Acres Various 2018-2019 2,639 1,373 4,012 Johnson County, Texas 91.5 Acres July 2019 449 - 449 Venus, Texas 50 Acres August 2019 422 24 446 Wise County, Texas 81.5 Acres September 2020 889 - 889 Bexar County, Texas 233 Acres February 2021 1,550 246 1,796 11,006 5,131 16,137 We also expect to provide financing solutions to a select group of our manufactured housing community-owner customers in a manner that includes developing new sites for products in or near urban locations where there is a shortage of sites to place our products. These solutions will be structured to give us an attractive return on investment when coupled with the gross margin we expect to make on products specifically targeted for sale to these new manufactured housing communities. Finally, our financial performance will be impacted by our ability to fulfill current orders for our manufactured homes from dealers and customers. Currently, our two Texas manufacturing facilities are operating at or near peak capacity, with limited ability to increase the volume of homes produced at those plants. Our Georgia manufacturing facility has unutilized square footage available and with additional investment can add capacity to increase the number of homes that can be manufactured. We intend to increase production at the Georgia facility over time, particularly in response to orders increasingly being generated from new markets in Florida and the Carolinas. In order to maintain our growth, we will need to be able to continue to properly estimate anticipated future volumes when making commitments regarding the level of business that we will seek and accept, the mix of products that we intend to manufacture, the

 timing of production schedules and the levels and utilization of inventory, equipment and personnel. We are actively reviewing organic and inorganic opportunities to add production capacity in attractive regions to meet future demand. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following accounting policies are critical to our operating results or may affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Allowance for Loan Losses Consumer Loan Receivable The allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of losses inherent in the consumer loans that may be uncollectible based upon review and evaluation of the consumer loan portfolio as of the date of the balance sheet. A reserve is calculated after considering, among other things, the loan characteristics, including the financial condition of borrowers, the value and liquidity of collateral, delinquency and historical loss experience. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components: the general reserve and specific reserves. Our calculation of the general reserve considers the historical loss rate for the last three years, adjusted for the estimated loss discovery period and any qualitative factors both internal and external to our company. Specific reserves are determined based on probable losses on specific classified impaired loans. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, which is normally when either principal or interest is past due and remains unpaid for more than 90 days. Management implemented this policy based on an analysis of historical data and performance of loans and the likelihood of recovery once principal or interest payments became delinquent and were aged more than 90 days. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are accounted for on a cash basis, first to interest and then to principal, as long as the remaining book balance of the asset is deemed to be collectible. The accrual of interest resumes when the past due principal or interest payments are brought within 90 days of being current. Impaired loans are those loans where it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off when deemed uncollectible. A loan is generally deemed impaired if it is more than 90 days past due on principal or interest, is in bankruptcy proceedings, or is in the process of repossession. A specific reserve is created for impaired loans based on fair value of underlying collateral value, less estimated selling costs. We use certain factors to determine the value of the underlying collateral for impaired loans. These factors are: (1) the length of time the unit was unsold after construction; (2) the amount of time the house was occupied; (3) the cooperation level of the borrowers, i.e., loans requiring legal action or extensive field collection efforts will reduce the value; (4) units located on private property present additional value loss because it tends to be more expensive to remove units from private property as opposed to a manufactured home park; (5) the length of time the borrower has lived in the house without making payments; (6) location and size, including market conditions; and (7) the experience and expertise of the particular dealer assisting in collection efforts. Collateral for repossessed loans is acquired through foreclosure or similar proceedings and is recorded at the estimated fair value of the home, less the costs to sell. At repossession, the fair value of the collateral is computed based on the historical recovery rates of previously charged-off loans; the loan is charged off and the loss is charged to the 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 allowance for loan losses. At each reporting period, the fair value of the collateral is adjusted to the lower of the amount recorded at repossession or the estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell, based on current information. Allowance for Loan Losses MHP Notes MHP Notes are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowance for loan losses. We determine the allowance by considering several factors including the aging of the past due balance, the customer s payment history, and our previous loss history. We establish an allowance reserve composed of specific and general reserve amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible. Historically we have not experienced material losses on the MHP Notes. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods. Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Raw materials cost approximates the first-in first-out method. Finished goods and work-in-process are based on a standard cost system that approximates actual costs using the specific identification method. Estimates of the lower of cost and net realizable value of inventory are determined by comparing the actual cost of the product to the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business based on current market and economic conditions, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation of the inventory. We evaluate inventory based on historical experience to estimate our inventory not expected to be sold in less than a year. We classify our inventory not expected to be sold in one year as non-current. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of each asset. Estimated useful lives for significant classes of assets are as follows: buildings and improvements, 30 to 39 years; vehicles, 5 years; machinery and equipment, 7 years; and furniture and fixtures, 7 years. Repair and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals or betterments which extend the useful lives of existing property, plant, and equipment are capitalized and depreciated. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used and when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such assets is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that the fair values are based primarily on independent appraisals and preliminary or definitive contractual arrangements less costs to dispose. Revenue Recognition Direct Sales Revenue from homes sold to independent retailers that are not financed and not under a consignment arrangement are generally recognized upon execution of a sales contract and when the home is shipped, at which time title passes to the independent retailer and collectability is reasonably assured. These types of homes are generally either paid for prior to shipment or floor plan financed through a third party lender by the independent retailer through standard industry arrangements, which can include repurchase agreements. Commercial Sales Revenue from homes sold to mobile home parks under commercial loan programs involving funds provided by our company is recognized when the home is shipped, at which time title passes to the customer and a sales and financing contract is executed, down payment received, and collectability is reasonably assured.

Table of Contents 
 Consignment Sales We provide floor plan financing for independent retailers, which takes the form of a consignment arrangement or a financed sale. Consignment sales under the inventory financing arrangement are considered sales of homes to the independent dealer and are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the home to the dealer s location. Sales under a consignment agreement are recognized as revenue when we enter into a sales contract and receive full payment for cash sales, and title passes; or, upon execution of a sales and financing contract, with a down payment received from and upon delivery of the home to the final individual customer, at which time title passes and collectability is reasonably assured. For homes sold to customers through independent retailers under consignment arrangements and financed by us, a percentage of profit is paid to the independent retailer up front as a commission for sale and also reimburses certain direct expenses incurred by the independent retailer for each transaction. Such payments are recorded as cost of product sales in our statement of operations. Retail Store Sales Revenue from direct retail sales through company-owned retail locations are generally recognized when the customer has entered into a legally binding sales contract, payment is received, the home is delivered at the customer s site, title has transferred, and collection is reasonably assured. Retail sales financed by us are recognized as revenue upon the execution of a sales and financing contract with a down payment received and upon delivery of the home to the final customer, at which time title passes and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized net of sales taxes. Product Warranties We provide retail home buyers with a one-year warranty from the date of purchase on manufactured inventory. Product warranty costs are accrued when the covered homes are sold to customers. Product warranty expense is recognized based on the terms of the product warranty and the related estimated costs. Factors used to determine the warranty liability include the number of homes under warranty and the historical costs incurred in servicing the warranties. The accrued warranty liability is reduced as costs are incurred and warranty liability balance is included as part of accrued liabilities in our balance sheet. Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in the financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Product sales increased 56.1 million, or 33.8 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was driven by higher average sales price, the conversion of certain independent dealer consignment arrangements to financing arrangements and an increase in unit volumes. The conversion of consignment arrangements to financing arrangements resulted in an increase to producet sales of approximately 29.1 million during 2022. We expect the conversion of consignment arrangements to financing arrangements to have minimal impact on product sales in 2023. Net revenue attributable to our factory-built housing consisted of the following in 2022 and 2021: 

Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Change Net revenue: Products sold 222,052 165,995 56,057 33.8 Total products sold 3,339 3,011 328 10.9 Net revenue per product sold 66.5 55.1 11.4 20.6 In 2022, our net revenue per product sold increased primarily because of the increase in unit prices over the first half of 2022, as rising material and labor costs were passed on to our customers. We had increases in consignment sales, direct sales, commercial sales and other product sales, slightly offset by a decrease in retail store sales. Sales through our company-owned retail stores have higher margins than our direct sales and consignment sales. For the six months ending December 31, 2022, we experienced a decrease in net revenue attributable to product sales due to the Company and the State of Georgia s efforts to evaluate and improve the quality and consistency of homes manufactured in our Eatonton facility. These efforts have resulted in a temporary decrease of approximately 36 in the rate of issuing HUD Labels of Certification and shipping finished homes from our Eatonton facility. We increased shipments from our Eatonton facility during the fourth quarter and plan to meet or exceed historical levels in 2023. Consumer and MHP loans interest income grew 1.4 million, or 5.0 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 and is primarily related to our increase in average outstanding consumer loan portfolio balance partially offset by a decrease in average outstanding MHP Note portfolio balance. The consumer loan portfolio has a higher average contractual interest 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 rate compared to the MHP Note portfolio average contractual interest rate. Between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 our consumer loan portfolio increased by 13.4 million resulting in an increase of consumer loan interest income. On September 30, 2021, we collected 44.9 million in principal payment from one of our borrowers. As a result of this payment, MHP loan interest income decreased during 2022 as compared to 2021, partially offsetting the increase in consumer loan interest income. Other revenue primarily consists of commercial lease rents, consignment fees and servicer fee revenue. Other revenue increased 2.1 million or 48.2 primarily due to a 1.4 million increase in consignment fees, a 0.5 million increase in commercial lease rents and a 0.2 million increase in servicer fee revenue. The cost of product sales increased 36.1 million, or 31.6 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in costs is primarily related to an increase in units sold and increases in the cost of materials and labor in 2022 which was materially passed along to our end-customer. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.3 million, or 18.3 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to a 5.7 million increase in salaries and incentive costs, a 0.6 million increase in warranty costs, a 0.6 million increase in consulting and professional fees, and a 0.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in legal expense, a 0.4 million increase in loan loss provision and a net 1.0 million decrease in other miscellaneous costs. Dealer incentive expense increased 0.1 million, or 6.5 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Other income (expense), net increased 2.4 million, or 141.4 , in 2022, as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to a 0.8 million increase in non-operating interest income, a 0.6 million increase in capital gains related to the sale of leased property, a 0.5 million increase in miscellaneous income, net, and a decrease of 0.5 million in interest expense. Income tax expense was 14.4 million for 2022 compared to 10.8 million for and 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 17.5 and primarily differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a federal tax credit for energy efficient construction and partially offset by state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 17.7 and primarily differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a federal tax credit for energy efficient construction and partially offset by state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash balances in bank accounts that may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. We have not incurred any losses from such accounts and management considers the risk of loss to be minimal. We believe that cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and provide for growth for the next 12 to 18 months and into the foreseeable future. In 2020, we negotiated a new credit agreement with Capital One, N.A. that expanded and extended our credit availability (see Indebtedness Capital One Revolver , below). As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to 1.0 million as of December 31, 2021. We also held an investment of 8.4 million in US Treasury Notes as of December 31, 2022.

 Cash Flow Activities 

Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (1,691) 60,296 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 9,081 (31,942) Net cash used in financing activities (5,614) (28,080) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,776 274 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 1,042 768 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 2,818 1,042 Comparison of Cash Flow Activities from 2022 to 2021 Net cash used in operating activities was 1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash of 60.3 million provided by operating activities during 2021. This change was primarily as a result of increased cash used for MHP originations net of collections, increased dealer inventory loan originations net of collections, increased volume of consumer loan originations net of principal collections, a decrease in accrued liabilities and an increase in other assets. The increase in cash used in operating activities was partially offset by an increase in operating income before non-cash adjustments, increased volume of other notes receivables principal collections net of originations, decreased inventories, increase in customer deposits, and increased dealer incentive liability. Net cash provided by investing activities of 9.1 million in 2022 was primarily attributable to 23.5 million of collections related to loans we made to third parties for the development of manufactured housing parks, proceeds of 1.7 million for the sale of leased property and collections of 0.5 million from our purchased consumer loans. These were offset by 8.4 million used for the purchase of our investment in treasury notes, 4.4 million used for loans to third parties for the development of manufactured housing parks and 3.8 million used for the acquisition of property plant and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities of 5.6 million in 2022 was attributable to net payments of 5.6 million on our lines of credit. Net cash used in financing activities of 28.1 million in 2021 was attributable to net payments of 28.2 million on our lines of credit offset by 0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options. Indebtedness Capital One Revolver. On March 30, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Capital One, N.A. for new revolving line of credit Revolver ). The Revolver had a maximum credit limit of 70,000,000 and a maturity date of March 30, 2024. On June 21, 2022, we received a Reservation of Rights notice from Capital One, N.A. The letter stated that our Revolver was in default. The default condition occurred due to our failure to timely file the Form 10-K and deliver certain financial statement to Capital One, N.A. On July 28, 2022, we entered into a Limited Waiver and First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Amendment with Capital One, N.A. The Amendment replaces the LIBOR borrowing rate with a secured overnight financing rate SOFR and waives a default arising out of a monetary judgement against us that exceeded the amount allowed in the Revolver. On August 24, 2022, we received a Notice of Default and Partial Suspension of Loan Commitments from Capital One, N.A. The notice stated that the July 28, 2022 forbearance agreement had been terminated and that Capital One, N.A. was permitted to suspend 50,000 of the 70,000 loan commitment under the Revolver. As a result, the available line of credit in the Revolver has been limited to 20,000. The Revolver accrues interest at one-month SOFR plus 2.00 . The interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 6.12 and 2.10 , respectively. Amounts available under the Revolver are subject to a formula 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 based on eligible consumer loans and MHP Notes and are secured by all accounts receivable, consumer loans and MHP Notes. The amount of available credit under the Revolver was 17,400,000 as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the Revolver, we paid certain arrangement fees and other fees of approximately 295,000, which were capitalized as unamortized debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the Revolver. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, interest expense under the Revolver was 225,000 and 887,000, respectively. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 2,545,000 and 7,993,000, respectively. The Revolver requires the Company to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2022, including that we maintain a tangible net worth of at least 120,000,000 and that we maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA of 4-to-1, or less. PILOT Agreement. In December 2016, we entered into a Payment in Lieu of Taxes PILOT agreement commonly offered in Georgia by local community development programs to encourage industry development. The net effect of the PILOT agreement was to provide us with incentives through the abatement of local, city and county property taxes and to provide financing for improvements to our Georgia plant (the Project ). In connection with the PILOT agreement, the Putman County Development Authority provided a credit facility for up to 10,000, which could have been drawn upon to fund Project improvements and capital expenditures as defined in the agreement. If funds had been drawn, we would have paid transaction costs and debt service payments. The PILOT agreement required interest payments of 6.00 per annum on outstanding balances, which would have been due each December 1 through maturity on December 1, 2021, at which time all unpaid principal and interest would have been due. The PILOT agreement is collateralized by the assets of the Project. No amounts were drawn on this credit facility. Contractual Obligations The following table is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2022: 

Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total 2023 2024 - 2025 2026 - 2027 After 2027 Lines of credit 2,545 2,545 Operating lease obligations 2,831 683 1,198 837 113 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, net sales, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. However, we do have a repurchase agreement with a financial institution providing inventory financing for independent retailers of our products. Under this agreement, we have agreed to repurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (24 months). Our obligation under this repurchase agreement ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately 8,925,000 and 4,908,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements. We consider our obligations on current contracts to be immaterial and accordingly we have not recorded any reserve for repurchase commitment as of December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our December 31, 2022 financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form-10K.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: Audit Committee, Board of Directors and Shareholders Legacy Housing Corporation Bedford, Texas Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Legacy Housing Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, and the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Unites States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

 as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021. Consumer loans receivable have maturities that range from to . Loan applications go through an underwriting process which considers credit history to evaluate credit risk of the consumer. Interest rates on approved loans are determined based on consumer credit score, payment ability and down payment amount. The Company uses payment history to monitor the credit quality of the consumer loans on an ongoing basis. The Company may also receive escrow payments for property taxes and insurance included in its consumer loan collections. The liabilities associated with these escrow collections totaled and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in escrow liability in the balance sheets. Allowance for Loan Losses Consumer Loans Receivable The allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of losses inherent in the consumer loans that may be uncollectible based upon review and evaluation of the consumer loan portfolio as of the date of the balance sheet. An allowance for loan losses is determined after giving consideration to, among other things, the loan characteristics, including the financial condition of borrowers, the value and liquidity of collateral, delinquency and historical loss experience. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of components: the general reserve and specific reserves. The Company s calculation of the general reserve considers the historical loss rate for the last , adjusted for the estimated loss discovery period and any qualitative factors both internal and external to the Company. Specific reserves are determined based on probable losses on specific classified impaired loans. The Company s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, which is normally when either principal or interest is past due and remains unpaid for more than 90 days. Management implemented this policy based on an analysis of historical data, current performance of loans and the likelihood of recovery once principal or interest payments became delinquent and were aged more than 90 days. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are accounted for on a cash basis, first to interest and then to principal, as long as the remaining book balance of the asset is deemed to be collectible. The accrual of interest resumes when the past due principal or interest payments are brought within 90 days of being current. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total principal outstanding for consumer loans on nonaccrual status was and , respectively. Impaired loans are those loans where it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. A loan is generally deemed impaired if it is more than 90 days past due on principal or interest, is in bankruptcy proceedings, or is in the process of repossession. A specific reserve is created for impaired loans based on fair value of underlying collateral value, less estimated selling costs. The Company used various factors to determine the value of the underlying collateral for impaired loans. These factors were: (1) the length of time the unit was unsold after construction; (2) the amount of time the house was occupied; (3) the cooperation level of the borrowers, i.e., loans requiring legal action or extensive field

Allowance for Loan Losses MHP Notes MHP Notes are stated at amounts due from customers, net of allowance for loan losses. The Company determines the allowance by considering several factors including the aging of the past due balance, the customer s payment history, and the Company s previous loss history. The Company establishes an allowance reserve composed of specific and general reserve amounts. There were minimal past due balances on the MHP Notes as December 31, 2022 and 2021 and charge offs were recorded for MHP Notes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 operating leases, of which are for the Company s Heritage Housing and Tiny Homes retail locations, which are subleased by the Company and are for corporate and administrative offices in Bedford, TX and Norcross, GA. These leases typically have initial terms ranging from to and include one or more to renew. Under ASC 842, a modified retrospective transition is required, applying the new standard to all leases at the date of initial application. The Company chose to use the adoption date of January 1, 2022 for ASC 842. As such, all periods presented after January 1, 2022, are under ASC 842 whereas periods presented prior to January 1, 2022, are in accordance with prior lease accounting of ASC 840. Financial information was not updated and the disclosures required under ASC 842 were not provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2022. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are right-of-use ROU assets and are shown as ROU assets operating leases on our Condensed Balance Sheet. The lease liabilities are shown as Operating lease obligation and Operating lease obligation, less current portion on our Condensed Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Therefore, lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability include all fixed payments in the lease arrangement. We record a ROU asset for an amount equal to the lease liability, increased for any prepaid lease costs and initial direct costs and reduced by any lease incentives. We remeasure the lease liability and ROU asset when a change to our future minimum lease payments occurs. Key assumptions and judgments included in the determination of the lease liability include the discount rate used in the present value calculation and the exercise of renewal options. Many of our leases contain renewal options. As the exercise of the renewal options is not certain at commencement of a lease, we generally do not include the option periods in the lease term when determining the lease liabilities and ROU assets. We remeasure the lease liability and ROU asset when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise a renewal option. Our leases do not provide information about the rate implicit in the lease. Therefore, we utilize an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of our future lease obligations. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized borrowing, for an amount equal to the lease payments, over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. The remaining weighted-average lease term is years and the weighted-average discount rate is . We consider lease payments that cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty upon lease commencement to be variable lease payments, which are recorded as incurred each period and are excluded from our calculation of lease liabilities. There were variable lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2022. Short-term leases, those with a term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on our Balance Sheet. Our short-term lease costs were not material for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which requires designing disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial reporting and of the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and disposition of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. Management s assessment included extensive documentation, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on management s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed in our Annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 3, 2022, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. Under standards established by the PCAOB, a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have not been fully remediated as of December 31, 2022. 
 62 

Table of Contents 
 The material weaknesses in financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 are summarized as follows: We determined that we did not have sufficient accounting systems and procedures in place, particularly in the areas of revenue recognition; processing of accounts payable; prepaid expenses; and inventory costing and management . We determined that we did not have sufficient policies and procedures to ensure the appropriate review and approval of user access rights to our accounting system; and lack of approval of journal entries and segregation of duties in our financial reporting process. We determined that our information technology infrastructure does not provide sufficient safeguards required by the COBIT framework . 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Previously-Identified Material Weaknesses In connection with these material weaknesses, we are in the process of taking remediation action, including the evaluation and implementation of appropriate processes and procedures with respect to key areas, including inventory costing and revenue recognition. We are also in the process of implementing remediation measures, including designing internal controls over financial reporting, defining user access rights and journal entry processes and approvals, and implementing more robust financial reporting databases and systems. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except for the remediation measures described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations in Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Exemption from Auditor Attestation on Internal Controls This Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies and emerging growth companies . ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION. Restatement of Previously Issued Condensed Financial Statements (unaudited) The Company has restated these financial statements to correct; (i) an overstatement of costs errantly assigned to accounts payable for inventory received but not invoiced for the period ended March 31, 2021 and for the period ended June 30, 2021, (ii) an understatement of costs errantly assigned to accounts payable for inventory received but not

 Board Composition Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. The number of directors is determined by our board of directors, subject to the terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Our board of directors currently consists of five members. The Board of Directors held its inaugural meeting on February 7, 2019. Director Independence Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Market. Under Nasdaq rules, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company s board of directors. In addition, Nasdaq rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company s audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees must be independent. Under Nasdaq rules, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of that company s board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (i) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. Our board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that Jeffrey K. Stouder, Francisco J. Coll and Joseph P. Lane, representing a majority of our directors, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under Nasdaq rules. In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. Board Committees Commencing with the closing of our IPO on December 14, 2018, our board of directors established three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Under Nasdaq rules, the membership of each committee consists entirely of independent directors. Given the date our committees were first established, our committees did not separately meet until early 2019. The following is a brief description of our committees. Audit committee. In accordance with our audit committee charter, our audit committee oversees our corporate accounting and financial reporting processes and our internal controls over financial reporting; evaluates the independent public accounting firm s qualifications, independence and performance; engages and provides for the compensation of the independent public accounting firm; approves the retention of the independent public accounting firm to perform any proposed permissible non-audit services; reviews our financial statements; reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates and internal controls over financial reporting; and discusses with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the results of the annual audit and the reviews of our quarterly financial statements. We believe that our audit committee members meet the requirements for financial literacy under the current requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. In addition, the board of directors has determined that Jeffrey K. Stouder is qualified as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of SEC regulations. We have made this determination based on information received by our board of directors. The audit committee is composed of Messrs. Stouder (Chairman), Coll and Lane.

 Compensation committee. In accordance with our compensation committee charter, our compensation committee reviews and recommends policies relating to compensation and benefits of our officers and employees, including reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers, evaluating the performance of these officers in light of those goals and objectives and setting compensation of these officers based on such evaluations. The compensation committee also administers the issuance of stock options and other awards under our equity-based incentive plans. We believe that the composition of our compensation committee meets the requirements for independence under, and the functioning of our compensation committee complies with, any applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. We intend to comply with future requirements to the extent they become applicable to us. The compensation committee is composed of Messrs. Lane (Chairman), Coll and Stouder. Nominating and governance committee. In accordance with our nominating and governance committee charter, our nominating and governance committee recommends to the board of directors nominees for election as directors, and meets as necessary to review director candidates and nominees for election as directors; recommends members for each committee of the board; oversees corporate governance standards and compliance with applicable listing and regulatory requirements; develops and recommends to the board governance principles applicable to the company; and oversees the evaluation of the board and its committees. We believe that the composition of our nominating and governance committee meets the requirements for independence under, and the functioning of our compensation committee complies with, any applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. We intend to comply with future requirements to the extent they become applicable to us. The nominating and governance committee is composed of Messrs. Lane (Chairman) and Stouder. Board Composition In August 2021, the SEC approved a Nasdaq Stock Market proposal to adopt new listing rules relating to board diversity and disclosure. As approved by the SEC, the new Nasdaq listing rules require all Nasdaq listed companies to disclose consistent, transparent diversity statistics regarding their boards of directors. Because our Board consists of only five (5) directors, the Company is required to have at least one diverse director. The Board Diversity Matrix below presents the board s diversity statistics in the format prescribed by the Nasdaq rules. 

Board Diversity Matrix (as of December 31, 2022) Total Number of Directors 5 Part I: Gender Identity Male Directors 5 Part II: Demographic Background Hispanic 1 White 4 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics We adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar functions, which is posted on our website. Our code of business conduct and ethics is a code of ethics, as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. The information contained on, or accessible from, our website is not part of this Form 10-K by reference or otherwise. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or waivers of, provisions of our code of business conduct and ethics on our website. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation None of the members of our compensation committee is an executive officer or employee of our company.

 Limitations on Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the maximum extent permitted by Texas law. Texas law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for: any breach of their duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law. Any repeal of, or modification to, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. Our bylaws also provide that we will advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in connection with their services to us, regardless of whether our bylaws permit such indemnification. We have entered into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our bylaws. These agreements, among other things, provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers for certain expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of such person s services as one of our directors or executive officers, or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are contained in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving one of our directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.

 Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Shipley s compensation structure, in light of the fact they have historically only received a relatively nominal salary of 50,000, is focused on increasing the equity value of our company as their primary compensation is in the value of their ownership interests in the company. Mr. Hodgson, whether individually or through entities or trusts he controls, owned 50 of the partnership interests in the company as of year-end 2017, which interests were converted to an initial allocation of 10,000,000 shares of common stock of the company upon the conversion to a corporation effective January 1, 2018. Mr. Shipley and his family members, whether individually or through an entity Mr. Shipley controls, owned 50 of the partnership interests of the company as of year-end 2017, which interests were converted into an initial allocation of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock of the company upon the conversion to a corporation. Mr. Shipley will continue to be compensated based on a fixed annual salary of 50,000. In January 2022, Mr. Hodgson entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (see Employment Agreements below). Employment Agreements On November 27, 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with each of Curtis D. Hodgson and Kenneth E. Shipley to serve as our Co-Chief Executive Officer for an initial term beginning January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2021. Following the initial expiration date of the employment agreements, and on each subsequent one year anniversary of such date, the term of the employment agreements will automatically be extended for one year, unless earlier terminated by either party. Generally, since founding our company, Mr. Hodgson has overseen our day-to-day business operations, including strategic planning and manufacturing, and Mr. Shipley has overseen our sales and distribution, including our company-owned retail locations. Under the employment agreements, each executive s annual salary is 50,000, which is subject to increase at the discretion of our compensation committee. The employment agreements provide for customary provisions for the termination of the executive s employment with us for cause (as defined in the applicable employment agreement) and for any reason other than for cause. The executive will be entitled to receive his salary for the remaining portion of the employment period if he is terminated other than for cause, payable in accordance with our company s regular payroll practices. Additionally, in the event the executive s employment with us is terminated within one year after a change of control (as defined in the applicable employment agreement) for reasons other than cause, we have agreed to pay the executive an amount equal to two years compensation at his then current rate of pay. The employment agreements also contain covenants (a) confirming that all intellectual property developed by each executive and relating to our business constitutes our sole and exclusive property, (b) prohibiting each executive 
 73 

Table of Contents 
 from disclosing confidential information regarding our company at any time, (c) restricting each executive from engaging in any activities competitive with our business during his employment with us and for a period of one year thereafter, and (d) preventing each executive from recruiting, soliciting or hiring away employees of our company for a period of two years after his employment with us. The employment agreements are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. On December 31, 2021, Mr. Shipley s employment agreement was automatically extended for one year. In January 2022, Mr. Hodgson entered into an amended and restated employment agreement which provides him with an annual salary of 200,000 and a signing bonus of 150,000 shares of restricted stock, which vested upon grant. Under this new agreement, he is also eligible for an annual incentive bonus at the discretion of our compensation committee and he is eligible for equity awards if the Company s stock price achieves certain targets. On February 7, 2019, our board of directors separated the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, consistent with corporate governance best practices. Mr. Hodgson transitioned from his role as our Co-Chief Executive Officer to become our executive Chairman of the Board and Mr. Shipley became our sole Chief Executive Officer and President. Effective in June 2022, Mr. Shipley became the Executive Vice President and Duncan Bates was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Hodgson, as an executive Chairman, will remain actively involved in our management in this role, including with respect to overall corporate strategy and manufactured home park development and financing.

The purpose of our Plan is to assist us in attracting, motivating, retaining and rewarding high-quality executives and other employees, officers, directors, consultants and other persons who provide services to us.

Administration. Our Plan is to be administered by our Compensation Committee, provided, however, that except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the board of directors may exercise any power or authority granted to the committee under our Plan. Subject to the terms of our Plan, the committee is authorized to select eligible persons to 
 74 

Table of Contents 
 receive awards, determine the type, number and other terms and conditions of, and all other matters relating to, awards, prescribe award agreements (which need not be identical for each participant), and the rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan, construe and interpret the Plan and award agreements, and correct defects, supply omissions or reconcile inconsistencies in them, and make all other decisions and determinations as the committee may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of our Plan. Eligibility. The persons eligible to receive awards under our Plan are the officers, directors, employees, consultants and other persons who provide services to us. An employee on leave of absence may be considered as still in the employ of our company for purposes of eligibility for participation in our Plan. Types of Awards. Our Plan provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock, deferred stock, dividend equivalents, bonus stock and awards in lieu of cash compensation, other stock-based awards and performance awards. Performance awards may be based on the achievement of specified business or personal criteria or goals, as determined by the committee. Shares Available for Awards. The total number of shares of common stock that may be subject to the granting of awards under our Plan at any time during the term of the Plan will be equal to 2,500,000 shares. This limit will be increased by the number of shares with respect to which awards previously granted under our Plan that are forfeited, expire or otherwise terminate without issuance of shares, or that are settled for cash or otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares, and the number of shares that are tendered (either actually or by attestation) or withheld upon exercise of an award to pay the exercise price or any tax withholding requirements. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. The committee is authorized to grant stock options, including both incentive stock options, or ISOs, which can result in potentially favorable tax treatment to the participant, and non-qualified stock options, and stock appreciation rights entitling the participant to receive the amount by which the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise exceeds the grant price of the stock appreciation right. The exercise price per share subject to an option and the grant price of a stock appreciation right are determined by the committee, but in the case of an ISO must not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. For purposes of our Plan, the term fair market value means the fair market value of common stock, awards or other property as determined by the committee or under procedures established by the committee. The maximum term of each option or stock appreciation right, the times at which each option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable, and provisions requiring forfeiture of unexercised options or stock appreciation rights at or following termination of employment generally are fixed by the committee, except that no option or stock appreciation right may have a term exceeding ten years. Restricted and Deferred Stock. The committee is authorized to grant restricted stock and deferred stock. Restricted stock is a grant of shares of common stock which may not be sold or disposed of, and which may be forfeited in the event of certain terminations of employment, prior to the end of a restricted period specified by the committee. A participant granted restricted stock generally has all of the rights of a stockholder of our company, unless otherwise determined by the committee. An award of deferred stock confers upon a participant the right to receive shares of common stock at the end of a specified deferral period, subject to possible forfeiture of the award in the event of certain terminations of employment prior to the end of a specified restricted period. Prior to settlement, an award of deferred stock carries no voting or dividend rights or other rights associated with share ownership, although dividend equivalents may be granted, as discussed below. Other Terms of Awards. Awards may be settled in the form of cash, shares of common stock, other awards or other property, in the discretion of the committee. The committee may require or permit participants to defer the settlement of all or part of an award in accordance with such terms and conditions as the committee may establish, including payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents on deferred amounts, and the crediting of earnings, gains and losses based on deemed investment of deferred amounts in specified investment vehicles. The committee is authorized to place cash, shares of common stock or other property in trusts or make other arrangements to provide for payment of our obligations under our Plan.

 Awards under our Plan are generally granted without a requirement that the participant pay consideration in the form of cash or property for the grant (as distinguished from the exercise), except to the extent required by law. The committee may, however, grant awards in exchange for other awards under our Plan, awards under other company plans or other rights to payment from us, and may grant awards in addition to and in tandem with such other awards, rights or other awards. Acceleration of Vesting; Change in Control. The committee may, in its discretion, accelerate the exercisability, the lapsing of restrictions or the expiration of deferral or vesting periods of any award, and such accelerated exercisability, lapse, expiration and if so provided in the award agreement or otherwise determined by the committee, vesting will occur automatically in the case of a change in control of our company, as defined in our Plan (including the cash settlement of stock appreciation rights which may be exercisable in the event of a change in control). In addition, the committee may provide in an award agreement that the performance goals relating to any performance award will be deemed to have been met upon the occurrence of any change in control. Amendment and Termination. The board of directors may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate our Plan or the committee s authority to grant awards without further stockholder approval, except stockholder approval must be obtained for any amendment or alteration if such approval is required by law or regulation or under the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which shares of common stock are then listed or quoted. Thus, stockholder approval may not necessarily be required for every amendment to our Plan which might increase the cost of our Plan or alter the eligibility of persons to receive awards. Stockholder approval will not be deemed to be required under laws or regulations, such as those relating to ISOs, that condition favorable treatment of participants on such approval, although the board of directors may, in its discretion, seek stockholder approval in any circumstance in which it deems such approval advisable. Our Plan will terminate at the earliest of (a) such time as no shares of common stock remain available for issuance under our Plan, (b) termination of our Plan by the board of directors, or (c) the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. Awards outstanding upon expiration of our Plan will remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired. It is intended that any amounts payable under the Plan will either be exempt from Section 409A of the Code or will comply with Section 409A (including Treasury regulations and other published guidance related thereto) so as not to subject an employee to payment of any other additional tax, penalty or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code. Director Compensation We currently compensate each non-employee director through annual stock option grants and by paying annual fees for their participation on the board and on respective board committees. Our board members will receive compensation of 10,000 per quarter, as well as an annual award of 10,000 in stock option grants that vest as of the next annual meeting or in one year. Our board of directors review director compensation annually or when circumstances exist requiring reexamination and adjust it according to then current market conditions and good business practices.

Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 24,380,224 shares of common stock outstanding as of the Beneficial Ownership Date. To our knowledge, except as set forth in the footnotes to this table and subject to applicable community property laws, each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such person s name.

 Corporate Conversion Effective January 1, 2018, we converted to a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Legacy Housing Corporation. Prior to January 1, 2018, we were a Texas limited partnership controlled by our Executive Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer. Upon the corporate conversion, all of our outstanding partnership interests were exchanged on a proportional basis for shares of common stock of Legacy Housing Corporation. The conversion qualified as a tax free transaction under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective December 31, 2019, the Company converted from a Delaware corporation to a Texas corporation. Policies and Procedures for Transactions with Related Persons Our board of directors adopted a written related person transaction policy setting forth the policies and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Related persons include any executive officer, director or a holder of more than 5 of our common stock, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Related person transactions refer to any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which (i) we were or are to be a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds 120,000, and (iii) a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related person transactions include, without limitation, purchases of goods or services by or from the related person or entities in which the related person has a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, and employment by us of a related person, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. The policy provides that in any related person transaction, our audit committee and board of directors will consider all of the available material facts and circumstances of the transaction, including the direct and indirect interests of the related persons, in the event the related person is a director (or immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated), the impact that the transaction will have on a director s independence, the risks, costs and benefits of the transaction to us, and whether any alternative transactions or sources for comparable services or products are available. After considering all such facts and circumstances, our audit committee and board of directors will determine whether approval or ratification of the related person transaction is in our best interests. For example, if our audit committee determines that the proposed terms of a related person transaction are reasonable and at least as favorable as could have been obtained from unrelated third parties, it will recommend to our board of directors that such transaction be approved or ratified. In addition, if a related person transaction will compromise the independence of one of our directors, our audit committee may recommend that our board of directors reject the transaction if it could affect our ability to comply with securities laws and regulations or Nasdaq listing requirements. Each transaction described above was entered into prior to the adoption of our audit committee charter and the foregoing policy. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.
