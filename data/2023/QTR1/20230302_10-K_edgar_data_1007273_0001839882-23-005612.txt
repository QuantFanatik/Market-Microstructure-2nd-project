Item
1. Business 

References
in this report to "we," "us," "our," "the Bank," or "the Company" refer to the registrant and its subsidiary that are consolidated for
financial reporting purposes. 

General 

The
Bank of South Carolina (the Bank was organized on October 22, 1986 and opened for business as a state-chartered
financial institution on February 26, 1987, in Charleston, South Carolina. The Bank was reorganized into a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, effective April 17, 1995. At the time of the reorganization, each outstanding share of the Bank was exchanged
for two shares of Company stock. 

Market
Area 

The
Bank operates as an independent, community oriented, commercial bank providing a broad range of financial services and products
to the Charleston North Charleston metro area, which includes Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester counties. We have five
banking house locations: 256 Meeting Street, Charleston, SC; 100 North Main Street, Summerville, SC; 1337 Chuck Dawley Boulevard,
Mt. Pleasant, SC; 2027 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard, Charleston, SC; and 9403 Highway 78, North Charleston, SC. We also have a future
banking house location at 1730 Maybank Highway, Charleston, SC we expect to open in June 2023. 

3 

The
Charleston North Charleston metro area grew 8.24 from 2018 to 2021 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis based
on real gross domestic product despite the economic contraction experienced in 2020 resulting from government-imposed shutdowns
imposed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Charleston and Berkeley counties are ranked in the top ten economies in
South Carolina based on real gross domestic product according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The largest nonfarm employers
in our market area are from trade, transportation, utilities, government and professional and business services. Trade,
transportation and utilities have been the main economic drivers of the growth in the area over the last five years. This includes
manufacturing campuses for Boeing, Volvo Cars, and Mercedes-Benz Vans in the area. Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics, in October
2022 the Charleston area unemployment rate was 3.1 compared to 3.7 nationally. The Charleston area continues to rank higher than
the other major metropolitan areas of the state of South Carolina in talent, innovative capacity, entrepreneurial and business
environment, and livability. 

The
Company (ticker symbol: BKSC) is publicly traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC NASDAQ ),
and is under the reporting authority of the SEC. All of our electronic filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are accessible at no cost on our website, http://www.banksc.com ,
(through the Investor Relations link). Our filings are also available through the SEC s web site at http://www.sec.gov
 or by calling 1-800-SEC-0330. 

Competition 

The
financial services industry is highly competitive. We face competition in attracting deposits and originating loans based upon
a variety of factors including: 

interest
 rates offered on deposit accounts 

interest
 rates charged on loans 

credit
 and service charges 

the
 quality of services rendered 

the
 convenience of banking facilities and other delivery channels 

relative
 lending limits in the case of loans 

increase
 in non-banking financial institutions providing similar services 

continued
 consolidation, and 

legislative,
 regulatory, economic, and technological changes. 

We
compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, finance companies, credit unions, financial technology companies and other financial services companies.
Many of our larger commercial bank competitors have greater name recognition and offer certain services that we do not. However,
we believe that we have developed an effective competitive advantage in our market area by emphasizing exceptional service and
knowledge of local trends and conditions. 

Lending
Activities 

We
focus our lending activities on small and middle market businesses, professionals and individuals in our geographic markets and
typically require personal guarantees. Our primary lending activities are for commercial, commercial real estate, and consumer
purposes with the largest category being commercial real estate. Most of our lending activity is to borrowers within our market
area. 

Commercial
Loans 

As
of December 31, 2022, 45.1 million, or 13.6 , of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans. We originate various types
of secured and unsecured commercial loans to customers in our market area in order to provide customers with working capital and
funds for other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to 10 years. These
loans bear either a fixed interest rate or an interest rate linked to a variable market index, depending on the individual loan,
its purpose, and underwriting of that loan. 

Commercial
credit decisions are based upon our credit assessment of each applicant. We evaluate the applicant s ability to repay in
accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and assess the risks involved. In addition to evaluating the applicant s
financial statements, we consider the adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan. Credit agency reports
of the applicant s personal credit history supplement our analysis of the applicant s creditworthiness. In addition,
collateral supporting a secured transaction is analyzed to determine its marketability. Commercial business loans generally have
higher interest rates than residential loans of a similar duration because they have a higher risk of default with repayment generally
depending on the successful operation of the borrower s business and the adequacy of any collateral. 

Commercial
Real Estate Loans 

As
of December 31, 2022, commercial real estate construction loans comprised 17.5 million, or 5.3 , of our loan portfolio. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule
reflecting the cost of construction. Loans are typically underwritten with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80 based on current
appraisals with value defined as the purchase price, appraised value, or cost of construction, whichever is lower. Repayment of
construction loans on non-residential and income-producing properties is normally attributable to rental income, income from the
borrower s operating entity, or the sale of the property. Construction loans are interest-only during the construction period,
which typically does not exceed twelve months, and are often amortized or paid-off with permanent financing. 

4 

Before
making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed
appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. 

Construction
financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss
on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimated value of the property at completion of construction
compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction loans also expose us to
risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. 

As
of December 31, 2022, 172.9 million, or 52.2 , of our loan portfolio consisted of other commercial real estate loans, excluding
commercial construction loans. Properties securing our commercial real estate loans are primarily comprised of business owner-occupied
properties, small office buildings and office suites, and income-producing real estate. 

We
base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating
a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property s projected net cash flow to the loan s
debt service requirement computed after a deduction for an appropriate vacancy factor and reasonable expenses. We typically require
property casualty insurance, title insurance, earthquake insurance, wind and hail coverage, and, if appropriate, flood insurance,
in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. 

Commercial
real estate loans generally carry higher credit risks than our other lending activities, as they typically involve larger loan
balances concentrated with single borrowers or a group of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing
properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is largely dependent
upon sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions not within
the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the underlying collateral or the future cash flow of the property. 

Consumer
Loans 

Consumer
real estate loans were 91.6 million, or 27.7 , of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Consumer real estate loans consist
of consumer construction loans, home equity lines of credit HELOCs ), and mortgage originations. We make mortgage
and construction loans for owner-occupied residential properties. Advances on construction loans are in accordance with a schedule
reflecting the cost of construction, but are limited to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 . Before making a commitment to fund
a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect
properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Similar to commercial real estate construction
financing, consumer construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied
real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimated value of the property
at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction
loans also expose us to risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with plans, specifications, and projected
costs. 

This
category of loans consists of loans secured by first or second mortgages on primary residences and originate as adjustable-rate
or fixed-rate loans. Owner-occupied properties located in the Company s market area serve as the collateral for these loans.
The Company currently originates residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 for traditional
owner-occupied homes. 

We
offer home equity loans and lines of credit secured by the borrower s primary or secondary residence. Our home equity loans
and lines of credit currently originate with an adjustable-rate with a floor. We generally underwrite home equity loans and lines
of credit with the same criteria that we use to underwrite mortgage loans to be sold. For a borrower s primary and secondary
residences, home equity loans and lines of credit are typically underwritten with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 when combined
with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We require a current appraisal or internally prepared real estate evaluations
on home equity loans and lines of credit. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect
our security interest in the underlying collateral. 

Other
consumer loans totaled 3.9 million, or 1.2 of the loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. These loans are originated for various
purposes, including the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other personal items or needs. 

Consumer
loans may entail greater credit risk than mortgage loans to be sold, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured
or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the
borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. The
application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may also limit the amount which can be
recovered on such loans. 

Paycheck
Protection Program 

On
March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act was signed into law, which
established the Paycheck Protection Program PPP and allocated 349.0 billion of loans to be issued by financial
institutions. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act Economic Aid
Act was enacted, which reauthorized lending under the PPP through March 31, 2021, with an additional 325.0 billion. Under
the program, the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA will forgive loans, in whole or in part, made by approved
lenders to eligible borrowers for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the program. These
loans were originated to assist small businesses affected by the coronavirus, or COVID-19. The Bank originated 55.3 million in PPP loans to
480 customers. PPP loans were 8.0 million, or 2.6 of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there
were no PPP loans outstanding. 

These
loans were 100 guaranteed by the SBA, subject to compliance with PPP requirements.

Loan
Approval Procedures and Authority 

Our
lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the
Board of Directors of the Bank. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan
and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower s ability to repay, we review the borrower s
employment, credit history, and other information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. 

The
objectives of our lending program are to: 

1. Establish
 a sound asset structure 

2. Provide
 a sound and profitable loan portfolio to: 

a)
Minimize risk to depositors funds 

 b)
Maximize the shareholders return on their investment 

3. Promote
 the stable economic growth and development of the market area served by the Bank 

4. Comply
 with all regulatory agency requirements and applicable law 

The
underwriting standards and loan origination procedures include officer lending limits, which are approved by the Board of Directors.
The individual secured/unsecured lending authority of the President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank is set at 1,500,000, and
the individual secured/unsecured lending authority of the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President is set at 1,000,000. The President/Chief
Executive Officer of the Bank and the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President may jointly lend up to 10 of the Bank s unimpaired
capital for the previous quarter end. In the absence of either of the above, the other may, jointly with the approval of either
the Chairman of the Board of Directors or a majority of the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors, lend up to 10 of the Bank s
unimpaired capital for the previous quarter end. The Board of Directors, with two-thirds vote, may approve the aggregate credit
in excess of this limit but may not exceed 15 of the Bank s unimpaired capital. Loan limits apply to the total direct and
indirect liability of the borrower. All loans above the loan officer s authority must have the approval of a loan officer
with the authority to approve a loan of that amount. Pooling of loan authority is not allowed except as outlined above for the
President/Chief Executive Officer, Senior Lender/Executive Vice President, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and a majority
of the Loan Committee or two-thirds of the Board of Directors. 

All
new credit which results in aggregate direct, indirect, and related credit, not under an approved line of credit of a threshold
set forth in our loan policy, with the exceptions of mortgage loans in the process of being sold to investors and loans secured
by properly margined negotiable securities traded on an established market or other cash collateral, are reviewed in detail on
a monthly basis by the Loan Committee. Certain new credits that meet a higher threshold than required for the Loan Committee are
reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Bank at its regular monthly meeting. 

Employees 

At
December 31, 2022, we employed 80 people, with one individual considered hourly, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining
agreement. We provide a variety of benefit programs including an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust; Stock Incentive Plan;
and health, life, disability and other insurance. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent. 

Supervision
and Regulation 

We
are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements or restrictions and
provide for general regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of operations. The regulations are primarily intended to protect
depositors, customers, and the integrity of the U.S. banking system and capital markets. The following information describes some
of the more significant laws and regulations applicable to us. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
applicable laws and regulations. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised
in Congress, state legislatures, and with the various bank regulatory agencies. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or
a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on our
business, operations and earnings. 

Dodd-Frank
Act 

On
July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act became effective.
This law has broadly affected the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at
strengthening the sound operation of the financial services industry. This legislation continues to affect the lending, deposit,
investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the
Bank. 

The
Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB to centralize responsibility for consumer
financial protection, including implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB
exercises supervisory review of banks under its jurisdiction, which includes banks with assets over 10 billion. The CFPB focuses its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in
the areas of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt
new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. Governmental intervention and new regulations could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Volcker
Rule 

Section
619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the Volcker Rule, prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred
to collectively as banking entities from engaging in two types of activities: proprietary trading and the ownership
or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as covered funds. Proprietary trading, in general, is trading
in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity s own account. In December 2013, federal banking agencies, the
SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company has evaluated our securities portfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds. 

Further, pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and
Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2018, the Volcker Rule was amended by modifying the definition of banking
entity to exclude certain community banks and their affiliates. Under the Volcker Rule, as amended, community banks
are excluded from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule if (i) the community bank, and every entity that controls it, has total
consolidated assets equal to or less than 10 billion and (ii) trading assets and liabilities of the community bank, and every
entity that controls it, are equal to or less than five percent of its total consolidated assets.

Bank
Holding Company Act 

The
Company is a one-bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a result, the Company is
primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the Federal Reserve Board under the act and its regulations promulgated thereunder. The Federal Reserve Board, together with the applicable Federal Reserve
Bank that is delegated with primary supervision responsibilities over the Company (collectively, the Federal Reserve ), is
the Company s primary federal banking regulator. 

Capital
Requirements 

The
Federal Reserve Board imposes certain capital requirements on the Company under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum
leverage ratio and minimum ratio of qualifying capital to risk-weighted assets or a community bank leverage ratio
for qualifying community banking organizations. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and
are described under Regulatory Capital Requirements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Note
18). The ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders depends on the Bank s ability to pay dividends to the Company,
which is subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in the section titled Dividends. 

Standards
for Safety and Soundness 

The
Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guidelines, operational
and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to (1) internal controls, information systems and internal
audit systems, (2) loan documentation, (3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate risk exposure, and (5) asset growth. The agencies
also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees, and
benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety
and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that
the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. 

Regulatory
Examination 

All
insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of
insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate banking agency against each institution
or affiliate, as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor, when applicable. As
a state-chartered bank located in South Carolina, the Bank is also subject to the regulations of the South Carolina State Board
of Financial Institutions. 

The
federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository
institution holding companies relating to, among other things, the following: 

Internal
 controls 

Information
 systems and audit systems 

Loan
 documentation 

Credit
 underwriting 

Interest
 rate risk exposure 

Asset
 quality 

Liquidity 

Capital
 adequacy 

Bank
 Secrecy Act 

Sensitivity
 to market risk 

Transactions
with Affiliates and Insiders 

We
are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders,
and their related interests. Such extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates,
and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than
the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

Dividends 

The
Company s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends it receives
from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank s payment of dividends to the Company. As a general
rule, the amount of a dividend may not exceed, without prior regulatory approval, the sum of net income in the calendar year to
date and the retained net earnings of the immediately preceding two calendar years. A depository institution may not pay any dividend,
without regulatory approval, if payment would cause the institution to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. 

Consumer
Protection Regulations 

Activities
of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected
by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Our loan operations are also subject to
federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as: 

The
 federal Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers 

The
 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions to provide
 information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial
 institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community
 it serves 

The
 Fair Lending Act, which requires fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit
 for consumers 

7 

The
 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed
 or other prohibited factors in extending credit 

The
 Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, which governs the use and provision of information
 to credit reporting agencies 

The
 Fair Debt Collection Act, which governs the manner in which consumer debt may be collected
 by collection agencies 

The
 Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act, which governs the protection of consumer information 

The
 rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility
 of implementing such federal laws 

The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to: 

The
 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer
 financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas
 of financial records 

The
 Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts
 and customer s rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller
 machines and other electronic banking services 

Regulation
 DD, which implements the Truth in Savings Act to enable consumers to make informed decisions
 about deposit accounts at depository institutions. 

Enforcement
Powers 

The
Company is subject to supervision and examination by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the South Carolina State Board of Financial
Institutions. The Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulations that significantly affect business and activities.
These regulatory bodies have broad authority to implement standards and to initiate proceedings designed to prohibit depository
institutions from engaging in activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute violations of applicable
laws, rules, regulations, administrative orders, or written agreements with regulators. These regulatory bodies are authorized
to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards, including the assessment of civil monetary penalties, the
issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and other actions. 

Bank
Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering 

We
are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 USA Patriot Act ). We must maintain a Bank Secrecy Act Program that includes established internal policies, procedures,
and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee-training program; and testing of the program by an independent
audit function. The enactment of the USA Patriot Act amended and expanded the focus of the Bank Secrecy Act to facilitate information
sharing among governmental entities and the Company for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. It improves anti-money
laundering and financial transparency laws, information collection tools and the enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government.
These provisions include (a) standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (b) rules to promote cooperation
among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism
or money laundering; (c) reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the U.S. Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network for transactions exceeding 10,000; (d) suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer
may be violating U.S. laws; and (e) regulations and enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer,
maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. 

Similar
in purpose to the Bank Secrecy Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ), a division of the U.S. Department
of Treasury, controls and imposes economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against
targeted countries and individuals based on threats to foreign policy, national security, or the U.S. economy. OFAC has and will
send banking regulatory agencies lists of names of individuals and organizations suspected of aiding, concealing, or engaging
in terrorist acts. Among other things, the Bank must block transactions with or accounts of sanctioned persons and report those
transactions after their occurrence. 

Bank
regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection
with the regulatory review of applications. 

Privacy
and Credit Reporting 

In
connection with our lending activities, we are subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending
to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA ).
The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank s
record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Under
the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, 
or substantial non-compliance. In addition, federal banking regulators, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,
have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information
to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain
personal information from being shared with nonaffiliated third parties.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management s
discussion and analysis is included to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flow. This discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes presented in Item 8 of this report and the supplemental financial data appearing throughout this report. Since the primary
asset of the Company is its wholly-owned subsidiary, most of the discussion and analysis relates to the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

The
Company is a bank holding company headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, with 653.3 million in assets as of December 31, 2022
and net income of 6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company offers a broad range of financial services through
its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank is a state-chartered commercial bank, which operates principally in the Charleston,
Dorchester, and Berkeley counties of South Carolina. The Bank s original and current concept is to be a full service financial
institution specializing in personal service, responsiveness, and attention to detail to foster long-standing
relationships. 

We
derive most of our income from interest on loans and investment securities. The primary source of funding for making these loans
and purchasing investment securities is our interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Consequently, one of the key measures
of our success is the amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such
as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread
between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

A
consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance
of borrowers. The reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses (the allowance and a reserve
for unfunded commitments (the unfunded reserve ). The allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent
in our loan portfolio while the unfunded reserve provides for potential losses related to unfunded lending commitments. For a
detailed discussion on the allowance for loan losses, see Allowance for Loan Losses . 

In
addition to earning interest on loans and investment securities, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to the
customer. The various components of other income and other expenses are described in the following discussion. The discussion
and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 and our operating results for 2021 compared to 2020, and should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report. In addition,
a number of tables have been included to assist in the discussion. 

The
following table sets forth certain summary financial information concerning the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary for the
last five years. The information was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements. The information should be read
in conjunction with this section of the report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, which are presented
in Item 8 of this report.

We
have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States GAAP and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements. Our significant accounting policies are set forth in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8
of this report. 

Certain
accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions made by the Company that have a material impact on the carrying
value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment
and assumptions we use are based on factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the number of
judgments and assumptions that we make, actual results could differ and have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets
and liabilities and our results of operations. 

We
consider our policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be our most subjective accounting policy due to the significant
degree of judgment. We have developed what we believe to be appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of
the allowance for loan losses, recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to our
loan portfolio. Our assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions, the impact of regulatory
examinations and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers, which were not known at the time of the issuance of the
consolidated financial statements. For additional discussion concerning our allowance for loan losses and related matters, see
 Allowance for Loan Losses . 

COVID-19 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Due to orders issued by the governor
of South Carolina and in an abundance of caution for the health of our customers and employees, in March 2020 the Bank closed
lobbies to all 5 offices but remained fully operational. The Bank subsequently reopened all of the lobbies in June 2021.

As discussed elsewhere in the report (See Part I Paycheck
Protection Program and Note 4 to the Company s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item
8 of this report), on March 27, 2020, the PPP was established under the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

While
the impacts of COVID-19 and its variants appeared to create less economic disruption during 2022 as compared to 2021 and 2020,
COVID-19 continues to evolve, along with governmental support and/or restrictions in response to it. As of December 31, 2021, the
Bank had received 391 PPP forgiveness applications, in the amount of 49.1 million in principal, and submitted 361 applications and
decisions to the SBA, in the amount of 47.7 million in principal. Of the 391 PPP submissions, 351 loans, in the amount of 46.9
million, were forgiven as of December 31, 2021. The remaining 129 loans, in the amount of 8.4 million, were forgiven during the
year ended December 31, 2022. There were no PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Upon forgiveness the Bank recognized the
deferred fee income in accordance with ASC 310-20. The Bank received processing fees of 2.4 million and recognized 0.4 million and
 1.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Regulatory
agencies, as set forth in the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with
Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), encouraged financial
institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of
the effects of COVID-19. In this statement, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive
actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and that the agencies will not criticize institutions for
working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the revised statement provides that eligible loan modifications related
to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Under Section 4013 of the
CARES Act, banks may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if the modifications are related to COVID-19, executed
on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier
of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency. All short- term loan modifications made
on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not considered TDRs. Beginning
in March 2020, the Bank provided payment accommodations to customers, consisting of 60-day principal deferral to borrowers negatively
impacted by COVID-19. During 2020, the Bank processed approximately 0.7 million in principal deferments to 84 customers, with
an aggregate loan balance of 29.7 million. The principal deferments represented 0.24 of our total loan portfolio as of December
31, 2020. The Bank did not process any principal deferments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Bank has examined
the payment accommodations granted to borrowers in response to COVID-19 and classified 9 loans, with an aggregate loan balance
of 4.0 million, that were granted payment accommodations as TDRs given the continued financial difficulty of the customer, associated
industry risk, and multiple deferral requests. All other borrowers were current prior to relief, were not experiencing financial
difficulty prior to COVID-19, and the Bank determined they were not considered TDRs. As of December 31, 2021, 4 of the TDRs were
removed from TDR status due to improvement in financial condition and sustained performance under the restructured terms, 2 TDRs
were paid off through refinancing into new loans at market terms, and 1 TDR was paid off. Two loans with a balance of 0.5 million
remained in TDR status as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, of the 75 customers that received payment accommodations that were
not classified as TDRs, 41 customers, with an aggregate loan balance of 9.9 million, had paid their loan in full as of December
31, 2021. An additional loan was removed from TDR status during 2022. The remaining loan with a balance of 0.1 million is paying
as agreed as of December 31, 2022. There are no loans that received payment accommodation past due greater than 30 days. The Bank
will continue to examine payment accommodations as requested by borrowers. 

While
the effects of COVID-19 have impacted all industries to varying degrees, during 2020 the Bank assessed the retail and/or service,
food and beverage, and short-term rental industries in our geographic area as having a higher risk due to the possibility of the
primary source of repayment not materializing. These industries are dependent upon the hospitality industry and were affected
by the mandates issued by the Governor of South Carolina to limit occupancy or close for a period of time. Our loans in these
industries represented 3.96 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and were temporarily downgraded to our Watch 
category during 2020. In May 2021, due to improving economic conditions, increased vaccination rates and a continued reopening
of the South Carolina economy, these loans were upgraded to our Satisfactory category. 

Effects
of COVID-19 or its variants may still negatively impact management assumptions and estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses.
However, it is difficult to assess or predict how, and to what extent, COVID-19 will affect the Bank in the future. 

COMPARISON
OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 TO DECEMBER 31, 2021 

Net
income decreased 0.1 million or 1.3 to 6.66 million, or basic and diluted income per share of 1.20 and 1.18, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 6.74 million or basic and diluted income per share of 1.22 and 1.19, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to lower mortgage banking income and gains on sales of securities
largely offset by higher average earning asset balances coupled with increased asset yields in our investment securities and a reduction in the provision for loan losses. Our
returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1.01 and 15.26 , respectively, compared
to 1.14 and 12.30 , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Net
interest income increased 1.5 million or 8.74 to 18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 17.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher balances of average earning assets coupled with an increase
in asset yields on our investment securities and increased interest rates on variable rate loans and new originations and renewals
of fixed rate loans. 

14 

Average
earning assets increased 61.3 million or 10.81 to 628.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 567.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily related to an increase in the average balance of investment securities and
interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, loans. The increase in investment securities and interest-bearing
balances at the Federal Reserve reflect the deployment of excess funds resulting from a 77.0 million increase in average deposits
during the year. 

We
recorded a 75,000 reduction to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a provision for
loan losses of 120,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by the composition of our loan
portfolio in accordance with our allowance for loan loss methodology and our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses. The Board of Directors determined that this provision was appropriate based upon the adequacy of our reserve. Charge-offs
of 42,644 and recoveries of 31,878, together with the reduction in the allowance, resulted in an allowance for loan losses of
 4.3 million or 1.30 of total loans as of December 31, 2022. 

Other
income decreased 1.8 million or 46.62 to 2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 3.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Other income reflects lower mortgage banking income and decreases in gain on sales of securities of 0.2 million.
Our mortgage banking income decreased 1.6 million or 71.17 to 0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to decreased volume associated with the higher interest rate environment experienced
in 2022. Mortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates and the housing market. 

Other
expense increased 0.1 million or 0.77 to 12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 12.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. Salaries and employee benefits increased approximately 0.1 million, or 1.47 , due to increased benefits,
payroll taxes and other employee-related costs. Net occupancy expense increased approximately 0.1 million due to rent escalation
provisions in certain of our leases. Other operating expenses decreased 0.1 million, or 0.77 . 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s effective tax rate was 22.91 compared to 23.50 during the year ended December
31, 2021. 

COMPARISON
OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 TO DECEMBER 31, 2020 

Net
income increased 0.2 million or 4.40 to 6.7 million, or basic and diluted income per share of 1.22 and 1.19, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 6.5 million or basic and diluted income per share of 1.17 and 1.14, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher average earning asset balances coupled with a
decline in our cost of funds. Our returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 1.14 
and 12.30 , respectively, compared to 1.29 and 11.96 , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Net
interest income increased 0.5 million or 2.61 to 17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 16.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on PPP loans and investment
securities. Interest and fees on loans and investment securities increased 0.4 million or 2.35 to 17.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 from 16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as the result of higher balances of average earning
assets. 

Average
earning assets increased 86.6 million or 18.01 to 567.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 480.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020. This is primarily related to an increase in the average balance of investment securities and
interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, loans. The increase in investment securities and interest-bearing
balances at the Federal Reserve reflect the deployment of excess funds resulting from an 85.8 million increase in average deposits
during the year. 

The
provision to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 120,000 compared to 240,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the composition of our loan portfolio in accordance with our allowance
for loan loss methodology. The Board of Directors determined that this provision was appropriate based upon the adequacy of our
reserve. Charge-offs of 20,990 and recoveries of 92,283, together with the provision to the allowance, resulted in an allowance
for loan losses of 4.4 million or 1.43 of total loans as of December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses is 1.47 of total
loans net of PPP loans. 

Other
income increased 0.5 million or 13.61 to 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 3.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2020. Other income reflects increases in gain on sales of securities of 0.3 million and service charges and fees of 0.2 million.
Our mortgage banking income increased 46,700 or 2.06 to 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 due to elevated volume associated with a continuation of the low interest rate environment. Mortgage banking
income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates and the housing market. 

Other
expense increased 0.6 million or 5.45 to 12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 11.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. Salaries and employee benefits increased approximately 0.2 million, or 3.03 , due to increased benefits,
payroll taxes and other employee-related costs. Net occupancy expense increased approximately 0.2 million due to rent escalation
provisions in certain of our leases. Other operating expense increased 0.2 million, or 14.45 , due to certain loan-related costs
and higher FDIC insurance assessments resulting from an increase in deposit balances. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s effective tax rate was 23.50 compared to 23.33 during the year ended December
31, 2020. 

ASSET
AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

We
manage our assets and liabilities to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to enable management to fund deposit withdrawals, loan
demand, capital expenditures, reserve requirements, operating expenses, and dividends; and to manage daily operations on an ongoing
basis. Funds are primarily provided by the Bank through customer deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage
loan sales, the sale or maturity of securities, temporary investments and earnings. The Asset Liability/Investment Committee ALCO manages asset and liability procedures though the ultimate responsibility rests with the President/Chief Executive Officer. At
December 31, 2022, total assets decreased 3.81 to 653.3 million from 679.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and total deposits
decreased 1.73 to 598.7 million from 609.2 million as of December 31, 2021. 

15 

As
of December 31, 2022, earning assets, which are composed of U.S. Treasury, Government Sponsored Enterprises and Municipal
Securities in the amount of 271.2 million, interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve in the amount of 13.0 million
and total loans, including mortgage loans held for sale, in the amount of 331.8 million, constituted approximately 94.29 of
our total assets. 

The
yield on a majority of our earning assets adjusts in tandem with changes in the general level of interest rates. Some of the Company s
liabilities are issued with fixed terms and can be repriced only at maturity. 

MARKET
RISK 

Market
risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our risk consists primarily of interest rate
risk in our lending and investing activities as they relate to the funding by deposit and borrowing activities. 

Our
policy is to minimize interest rate risk between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at various maturities
and to attempt to maintain an asset sensitive position over a one-year period. By adhering to this policy, we anticipate that
our net interest margins will not be materially affected, unless there is an extraordinary and or precipitous change in interest
rates. The average net interest rate margin for 2022 decreased to 3.01 from 3.06 for 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our
net cumulative gap was liability sensitive for periods less than one year and asset sensitive for periods of one year or more.
The reason for the shift in sensitivity is the direct result of management s strategic decision to invest excess funds held
at the Federal Reserve into fixed rate investment securities that match our investment policy objectives. Management is aware
of this departure from policy and will continue to closely monitor our sensitivity position going forward. 

Since
the rates on most of our interest-bearing liabilities can vary on a daily basis, we continue to maintain a loan portfolio priced
predominately on a variable rate basis. However, in an effort to protect future earnings in a declining rate environment, we offer
certain fixed rates, interest rate floors, and terms primarily associated with real estate transactions. We seek stable, long-term
deposit relationships to fund our loan portfolio. Furthermore, we do not have any brokered deposits or internet deposits. 

At
December 31, 2022, the average maturity of the investment portfolio was 3.45 years with an average yield of 1.18 compared to
4.76 years with an average yield of 1.02 at December 31, 2021. 

We
do not take foreign exchange or commodity risks. In addition, we do not own mortgage-backed securities, nor do we have any exposure
to the sub-prime market or any other distressed debt instruments.

Proper
liquidity management is crucial to ensure that we are able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet
the credit needs of our existing customers. Investment securities are an important tool in our liquidity management. Our
primary liquid assets are cash and due from banks, investment securities available for sale, interest-bearing deposits at the
Federal Reserve, and mortgage loans held for sale. Our primary liquid assets accounted for 45.89 and 52.30 of total assets
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investment securities classified as available for sale, which are not pledged,
may be sold in response to changes in interest rates and liquidity needs. All of the investment securities presently owned
are classified as available for sale. Net cash provided by operations and deposits from customers have been the primary
sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2022, we had unused short-term lines of credit totaling approximately 41 million
(which can be withdrawn at the lender s option). Additional sources of funds available to us for liquidity include
increasing deposits by raising interest rates paid and selling mortgage loans held for sale. We also established a
Borrower-In-Custody arrangement with the Federal Reserve. This arrangement permits us to retain possession of assets pledged
as collateral to secure advances from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. At December 31, 2022, we could borrow up to 78.3
million. 

Our
core deposits consist of non-interest bearing demand accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, time deposits and savings
accounts. We closely monitor our reliance on certificates of deposit greater than 250,000 and other large deposits. We maintain
a Contingency Funding Plan CFP that identifies liquidity needs and weighs alternate courses of action designed
to address these needs in emergency situations. We perform a quarterly cash flow analysis and stress test the CFP to evaluate
the expected funding needs and funding capacity during a liquidity stress event. We believe our liquidity sources are adequate
to meet our operating needs and do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse effect
on our liquidity position. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our liquidity ratio was 48.09 and 56.43 , respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, we had
25 U.S. Treasury Notes and 77 Municipal Securities with an unrealized loss of 12.1 million and 3.4 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2021, we had fifteen U.S. Treasury Notes and nineteen Municipal Securities with an unrealized loss of 1.3 million and
 0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had no U.S. Treasury Notes or Municipal Securities with an unrealized loss.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 11 securities issued by Government-Sponsored Enterprises with an unrealized loss of 10.3 million
compared to nine Government-Sponsored Enterprises with an unrealized loss of 1.9 million as of December 31, 2021. The unrealized
losses on these securities are related to changes in the interest rate environment from the date of purchase. The contractual terms
of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment.
Therefore, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired. We have the ability to hold these investments until
market price recovery or maturity. 

The primary purpose of the
investment portfolio is to fund loan demand, manage fluctuations in deposits and liquidity, satisfy pledging requirements and generate
a favorable return on investment. In doing these things, our main objective is to adhere to sound investment practices. To that
end, all purchases and sales of investment securities are made through reputable securities dealers that have been approved by
the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of the Bank reviews the entire investment portfolio at each regular monthly meeting,
including any purchases, sales, calls, and maturities during the previous month. Furthermore, the Credit Department conducts a
financial underwriting assessment of all municipal securities and their corresponding municipalities annually and management reviews
the assessments. 

LOAN PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION 

We focus our lending activities
on small and middle market businesses, professionals and individuals in our geographic market. At December 31, 2022, outstanding
loans (including deferred loan fees of 159,434) totaled 331.0 million, which equaled 55.29 of total deposits and 50.66 of total
assets.

increased 24.3 million. This is primarily due to growth in our consumer real estate and commercial real estate portfolios. 

We had no foreign loans or loans to fund leveraged
buyouts at any time during the years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2022. 

The following table presents

IMPAIRED LOANS 

A loan is impaired when
it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based
on current information and events. All loans with a principal balance over 50,000 placed on non-accrual status are classified
as impaired. However, not all impaired loans are on non-accrual status nor do they all represent a loss. 

Impairment loss is measured by: 

a. The present value of the future cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or 

b. The fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 

The following is a schedule of our impaired loans
and non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2018 through 2022.

Beginning in March 2020,
the Bank provided payment accommodations to customers, consisting of 60-day principal deferral to borrowers negatively impacted
by COVID-19. During 2020, the Bank processed approximately 0.7 million in principal deferments to 84 customers, with an aggregate
loan balance of 29.7 million. The Bank did not process any principal deferments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The principal deferments represented 0.24 of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS 

According to GAAP, we are
required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as a troubled debt restructuring TDR ), when
appropriate. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if we, for economic or legal reasons related
to a borrower s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. Three factors
must always be present: 

1. An existing credit must formally be renewed, extended, or modified, 

2. The borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, and 

3. We grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider. 

The following is a schedule of our TDR s
including the number of loans represented.

The Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 310-20-35-9 allows a loan to be removed
from TDR status if the terms of the loan reflect current market rates and the loan has been performing under modified terms for
an extended period of time or under certain other circumstances. 

Nine TDRs with a balance
of 4.7 million at December 31, 2020 were removed from TDR status during the year ended December 31, 2021. Five TDRs with a balance
of 3.8 million were removed from TDR status due to improvement in financial condition and sustained performance under the restructured
terms, two TDRs with a balance of 0.5 million were paid off, and two TDRs with a balance of 0.4 million were paid off through
refinancing into new loans at market terms. One TDR with a balance of 33,300 at December 31, 2017 was removed from TDR status
during the year ended December 31, 2018 since, at the most recent renewal, the loan was amortized at market rate and no concessions
were granted. We do not know of any potential problem loans which will not meet their contractual obligations that are not otherwise
discussed herein. 

Regulatory agencies, as
set forth in the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected
by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), have encouraged financial institutions to
work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of
COVID-19. In this statement, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that
may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and that the agencies will not criticize institutions for working with
borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the revised statement provides that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19
may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act,
banks may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if the modifications are related to COVID-19, executed on a loan that
was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31,
2020 or 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency. All short- term loan modifications made on a good faith
basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not considered TDRs. Beginning in March 2020,
the Bank provided payment accommodations to customers, consisting of 60-day principal deferral to borrowers negatively impacted
by COVID-19. The Bank has examined the payment accommodations granted to borrowers in response to COVID-19 and classified 9 loans,
with an aggregate loan balance of 4.0 million, that were granted payment accommodations as TDRs given the continued financial
difficulty of the customer, associated industry risk, and multiple deferral requests. As of December 31, 2021, 4 of the TDRs were
removed from TDR status due to improvement in financial condition and sustained performance under the restructured terms, 2 TDRs
were paid off through refinancing into new loans at market terms, and 1 TDR was paid off. Two loans with a balance of 0.5 million
remained in TDR status as of December 31, 2021. An additional loan was removed from TDR status during 2022. The remaining loan with a balance of 0.1 million is paying as agreed as of
December 31, 2022. The Bank will continue to examine payment accommodations as requested by the borrowers. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 

The allowance for loan
losses represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses
(the allowance is reviewed by the Loan Committee and by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. For purposes
of this analysis, adequacy is defined as a level sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance
sheet date presented. To remain consistent with GAAP, the methodology employed for this analysis has been modified over the years
to reflect the economic environment and new accounting pronouncements. The Credit Department reviews this calculation on a quarterly
basis. In addition, an independent third party validates the allowance calculation on a periodic basis. The methodology is based
on a reserve model that is comprised of the three components listed below: 

1) Specific reserve analysis for impaired loans based on FASB ASC 310-10-35, Receivables - Overall 

2) General reserve analysis applying historical loss rates based on FASB ASC 450-20, Contingencies: Loss Contingencies 

3) Qualitative or environmental factors. 

Loans greater than 50,000 are
reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis if any of the following criteria are met: 

1) The loan is on non-accrual 

2) The loan is a troubled debt restructuring 

3) The loan is over 60 days past due 

4) The loan is rated substandard, doubtful, or loss 

5) Excessive principal extensions are executed 

6) If we are provided information that indicates we will not collect all principal and interest as scheduled 

Impairment is measured by
the present value of the future cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral
if the loan is collateral dependent. An impaired loan may not represent an expected loss. 

21 

A general reserve analysis
is performed on all loans, excluding impaired loans. This analysis includes a pool of loans that are reviewed for impairment but
are not found to be impaired. Loans are segregated into similar risk groups and a historical loss ratio is determined for each
group over a five-year period. The five-year average loss ratio by loan type is then used to calculate the estimated loss based
on the current balance of each group. 

Qualitative and environmental
loss factors are also applied against the portfolio, excluding impaired loans. These factors include external risk factors that
we believe are representative of our overall lending environment. We believe that the following factors create a more comprehensive
loss projection, which we can use to monitor the quality of the loan portfolio. 

1) Portfolio risk 

a) Levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans and changes in loan rating matrix 

b) Trends in volume and terms of loans 

c) Over-margined real estate lending risk 

2) National and local economic trends and conditions 

3) Effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting practices 

4) Experience, ability and depth of lending management staff 

5) Industry conditions 

6) Effects of changes in credit concentrations 

a) Loan concentration 

b) Geographic concentration 

c) Regulatory concentration 

7) Loan and credit administration risk 

a) Collateral documentation 

b) Insurance risk 

c) Maintenance of financial information risk 

Portfolio Risk 

 Portfolio risk includes
the levels and trends in delinquencies, impaired loans and changes in the loan rating matrix, trends in volume and terms of loans,
and over- margined real estate lending. We are satisfied with the stability of the past due and non-performing loans and believe
there has been no decline in the quality of our loan portfolio due to any trend in delinquent or adversely classified loans. Sizable
unsecured principal balances on a non-amortizing basis are monitored. Although the vast majority of our real estate loans are underwritten
on a cash flow basis, the secondary source of repayment is typically tied to our ability to realize the conversion of the collateral
to cash. Accordingly, we closely monitor loan to value ratios. The maximum collateral advance rate is 80 on all real estate transactions,
with the exception of raw land at 65 and land development at 70 . 

Occasionally, we extend
credit beyond our normal collateral advance margins in real estate lending. We refer to these loans as over-margined real estate
loans. These loans are
monitored and the balances reported to the Board of Directors every quarter. An excessive level of this practice (as a percentage
of capital) could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, competitive disadvantages and potential losses if forced to convert
the collateral. The consideration of over-margined real estate loans directly relates to the capacity of the borrower to repay.
We often request additional collateral to bring the loan to value ratio within the policy objectives and require a strong secondary
source of repayment. 

Although significantly under
our policy threshold of 100 of capital (currently approximately 38.8 million), the amount of over-margined real estate loans
currently totals approximately 2.9 million or approximately 0.88 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.5
million or approximately 0.48 of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. 

A credit rating matrix is used
to rate all extensions of credit and to provide a more specific picture of the risk each loan poses to the quality of the loan
portfolio. There are eight possible ratings used to determine the quality of each loan based on the following characteristics: cash
flow, collateral quality, guarantor strength, financial condition, management quality, operating performance, the relevancy of the
financial statements, historical loan performance, debt coverage ratio, and the borrower s leverage position. The matrix is
designed to meet our standards and expectations of loan quality. It is based on experience with similarly graded loans, industry
best practices, and regulatory guidance. Our loan portfolio is graded in its entirety, with the exception of PPP loans. Because PPP
loans were 100 guaranteed by the SBA and did not undergo the Bank s typical underwriting process, they were not
graded. There were no PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2022. 

National and local
economic trends and conditions 

 National and local economic
trends and conditions are constantly changing and both positively and negatively impact borrowers. Most macroeconomic conditions
are not controllable by us and are incorporated into the qualitative risk factors. Natural and environmental disasters, including
the rise of sea levels, political uncertainty, increasing levels of consumer price inflation, supply-chain disruptions and international
instability are a few of the trends and conditions that are currently affecting the national and local economies. Additionally,
the national and local economy has been affected by COVID-19 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These changes have
impacted borrowers ability, in many cases, to repay loans in a timely manner. On occasion, a loan s primary source
of repayment (i.e. personal income, cash flow, or lease income) may be eroded as a result of unemployment, lack of revenues, or
the inability of a tenant to make rent payments. 

Effects of changes
in risk selection and underwriting practices 

 The quality of our loan
portfolio is contingent upon our risk selection and underwriting practices. All new loans (except for mortgage loans in the
process of being sold to investors and loans secured by properly margined negotiable securities traded on an established
market or other cash collateral) with exposure over 300,000 are reviewed by the Loan Committee on a monthly basis. The Board
of Directors review credits over 750,000 monthly. Annual credit analyses are conducted on credits over 500,000 upon the
receipt of updated financial information. Prior to extensions of credit, significant loan opportunities go through sound
credit underwriting. Our Credit Department conducts a detailed cash flow analysis on each proposal using the most current
financial information. 

22 

Experience, ability
and depth of lending management staff 

 We have over 300 combined
years of lending experience among our lending staff. We are aware of the many challenges currently facing the banking industry.
As other banks look to increase earnings in the short term, we will continue to emphasize the need to maintain safe and sound lending
practices and core deposit growth managed with a long-term perspective. 

Industry conditions 

 There continues to be an
influx of new banks and consolidation of existing banks in our geographic area, which creates pricing competition. We believe that
our borrowing base is well established and therefore unsound price competition is not necessary. 

Effects of changes
in credit concentrations 

 The risks associated with
the effects of changes in credit concentration include loan, geographic and regulatory concentrations. As of December 31, 2022,
two Standard Industrial Code groups, activities related to real estate and redi-mix concrete, comprised more than 2 of our total
loans outstanding. 

Effects of changes
in geographic concentrations 

 We are located along the
east coast of the United States and on an earthquake fault line, increasing the chances that a natural disaster may impact our
borrowers and us. We have a Disaster Recovery Plan in place; however, the amount of time it would take for our customers to return
to normal operations is unknown. Our plan is reviewed and tested annually. 

Loan and credit
administration risk 

 Loan and credit administration
risk includes collateral documentation, insurance risk and maintaining financial information risk. 

The majority of our loan portfolio
is collateralized with a variety of our borrowers assets. The execution and monitoring of the documentation to properly
secure the loan is the responsibility of our lenders and loan department. We require insurance coverage naming us as the mortgagee
or loss payee. Although insurance risk is also considered collateral documentation risk, the actual coverage, amounts of coverage
and increased deductibles are important to management. 

Financial Information Risk
includes a function of time during which the borrower s financial condition may change; therefore, keeping financial information
up to date is important to us. Our policy requires all new loans (with a credit exposure of 10,000 or more), regardless of the
customer s history with us, to have updated financial information. In addition, we monitor appraisals closely as real estate
values are appreciating. 

Based on our analysis of
the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss model, we recorded a reduction in the allowance for loan loss of 0.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a provision for loan loss of 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. At December
31, 2022, the five-year average loss ratios were: 0.19 Commercial, 0.00 Commercial Real Estate Construction, -0.02 Commercial
Real Estate Other, -0.03 Consumer Real Estate, and 0.46 Consumer Other. 

With regard to jumbo loans, we obtain peer data for use to calculate historical loss ratios. At December 31, 2022, the 5-year average
loss for the jumbo loan portfolio was 0.01 . 

During the year ended December
31, 2022, charge-offs of 42,644 and recoveries of 31,878 were recorded to the allowance for loan losses, resulting in an allowance
for loan losses of 4.3 million or 1.30 of total loans at December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, charge-offs
of 20,990 and recoveries of 0.1 million were recorded to the allowance for loan losses, resulting in an allowance for loan losses
of 4.4 million or 1.43 of total loans at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, charge-offs of 0.3 million
and recoveries of 0.2 million were recorded to the allowance for loan losses, resulting in an allowance for loan losses of 4.2
million or 1.30 of total loans at December 31, 2020. We believe loss exposure in the portfolio is identified, reserved against,
and closely monitored to ensure that economic changes are promptly addressed in the analysis of reserve adequacy. 

The accrual of interest
is generally discontinued on loans which become 90 days past due as to principal or interest. The accrual of interest on some loans
may continue even though they are 90 days past due if the loans are well secured or in the process of collection and we deem it
appropriate. If non-accrual loans decrease their past due status to less than 30 days for a period of six to nine months, they
are reviewed individually to determine if they should be returned to accrual status. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were
no loans over 90 days past due still accruing interest.

We believe the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 is adequate to cover estimated losses in the loan portfolio;
however, assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment. Our judgments are based
on numerous assumptions about current events that we believe to be reasonable, but may or may not be valid. Thus, there can
be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in
the allowance will not be required. No assurance can be given that our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of
changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance,
thus adversely affecting our operating results. 

The following table presents
a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years.

The allowance is also subject
to examination testing by regulatory agencies, which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and
the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions and other adequacy tests. In addition, such regulatory agencies
could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination. 

The methodology used to
determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, which is included in other liabilities, is inherently similar to the methodology
used to determine the allowance for loan losses described above, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including
the probability of funding and historical loss ratio. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no provisions were recorded.
The balance for the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was 44,912 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

NONPERFORMING ASSETS

decreased 32.7 million to 223.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The higher balance in 2021 for these demand deposits was temporary
in nature. 

We fund growth through core
deposits. We do not have, nor do we rely on, Brokered Deposits or Internet Deposits. 

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS 

At December 31, 2022 and
2021, we had no outstanding federal funds purchased. We have a Borrower-In-Custody arrangement with the Federal Reserve. This arrangement
permits the Company to retain possession of loans pledged as collateral to secure advances from the Federal Reserve Discount Window.
Under this agreement, we may borrow up to 78.3 million. We established this arrangement as an additional source of liquidity. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had unused
short-term lines of credit totaling approximately 41 million (which are withdrawable at the lender s option). 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the normal course of
operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded in the financial statements,
or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit,
interest rate, and liquidity risk. We use such transactions for general corporate purposes or customer needs. General corporate
purpose transactions are used to help manage credit, interest rate and liquidity risk or to optimize capital. Customer transactions
are used to manage customer requests for funding. 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements
consist principally of commitments to extend credit described below. We estimate probable losses related to binding unfunded lending
commitments and record a reserve for unfunded lending commitments in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December
31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of this reserve was 44,912. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no interests in non-consolidated
special purpose entities. 

Commitments to extend
credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many
of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is
based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, negotiable
instruments, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and real estate. Commitments to extend credit, including unused lines
of credit, amounted to 145.4 million and 117.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

26 

Standby letters of credit
represent our obligation to a third-party contingent upon the failure of our customer to perform under the terms of an underlying
contract with the third party or obligates us to guarantee or stand as surety for the benefit of the third party. The underlying
contract may entail either financial or nonfinancial obligations and may involve such things as the shipment of goods, performance
of a contract, or repayment of an obligation. Under the terms of a standby letter, generally drafts will be drawn only when the
underlying event fails to occur as intended. We can seek recovery of the amounts paid from the borrower. Commitments under standby
letters of credit are usually for one year or less. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments related to standby
letters of credit at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 2.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively. 

We originate certain fixed rate residential
loans and commit these loans for sale. The commitments to originate fixed rate residential loans and the sales commitments
are freestanding derivative instruments. We had forward sales commitments, totaling 0.9 million at December 31, 2022, to
sell loans held for sale of 0.9 million, compared to forward sales commitments of 2.8 million at December 31, 2021, to sell
loans held for sale of 2.8 million. The fair value of these commitments was not significant at December 31, 2022 or 2021. We
had no embedded derivative instruments requiring separate accounting treatment. 

Once we sell certain fixed
rate residential loans, the loans are no longer reportable on our balance sheet. With most of these sales, we have an obligation
to repurchase the loan in the event of a default of principal or interest on the loan. This recourse period ranges from three to
nine months. Misrepresentation or fraud carries unlimited time for recourse. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse
was 8.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 30.8 million at December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, there were two loans and one loan repurchased, respectively. 

EFFECT OF INFLATION
AND CHANGING PRICES 

The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical
dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. 

Unlike most other industries,
the assets and liabilities of financial institutions like the Company are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates
generally have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices.
In addition, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services.
We strive to manage the relationship between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest
rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our capital needs have been
met to date through the 10.6 million in capital raised in our initial offering, the retention of earnings less dividends paid
and the exercise of options to purchase stock. Total shareholders equity at December 31, 2022 was 38.8 million. The rate
of asset growth since our inception has not negatively impacted our capital base. 

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board
approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s BCBS capital
guidelines for U.S. banks Basel III ). Following the actions by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC also approved
regulatory capital requirements on July 9, 2013. The FDIC s rule is identical in substance to the final rules issued by
the Federal Reserve Bank. 

The purpose of Basel III is to
improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital for all banking organizations. The minimum requirements for the quantity
and quality of capital were increased. The rule includes a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5 
and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. The rule also raised the minimum ratio
of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 to 6 and requires a minimum leverage ratio of 4 . In addition, the rule implemented
a strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and improved the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets
to enhance risk sensitivity. 

On November 4, 2019, the federal
banking agencies jointly issued a final rule on an optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking
organizations called the community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework effective on January 1, 2020. A qualifying community
banking organization is defined as having less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, a leverage ratio greater than 9 , off-balance
sheet exposures of 25 or less of total consolidated assets, and trading assets and liabilities of 5 or less of total consolidated assets.
Additionally, the qualifying community banking institution must be a non-advanced approaches FDIC supervised institution. The final rule
adopts Tier 1 capital and existing leverage ratio into the CBLR framework. The Bank adopted this rule as of September 30, 2020 and is
no longer subject to other capital and leverage requirements. A CBLR bank meeting qualifying criterion is deemed to have met the well
capitalized ratio requirements and be in compliance with the generally applicable capital rule. The Bank s CBLR as of December
31, 2022 was 9.03 . As of December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank were categorized as well capitalized. We believe,
as of December 31, 2022, that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. 

There are no current
conditions or events that we are aware of that would change the Company s or the Bank s capital adequacy category. 

Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the Company s and the Bank s capital ratios at December 31,
2022.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors
of Bank of South Carolina Corporation: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Bank of South Carolina Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the
related notes to the consolidated financial statements and schedules (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical audit matters communicated
below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

 As described in Note 4 to the
Company s financial statements, the Company has a gross loan portfolio of approximately 331.0 million and related allowance for
loan losses of approximately 4.3 million as of December 31, 2022. As described by the Company in Note 1, the evaluation of the allowance
for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes
available. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis and is based upon the Company s review of the collectability
of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s
ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. 

We identified the Company s
estimate of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of the allowance
for loan losses as a critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining
the qualitative factors. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions by the Company involves especially challenging auditor judgment
due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill
or knowledge needed. 

The primary procedures we performed
to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

We
evaluated the relevance and the reasonableness of assumptions related to evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions,
and other risk factors used in development of the qualitative factors for collectively evaluated loans. 

We validated the completeness
and accuracy of the underlying data used to develop the factors. 

We validated the mathematical
accuracy of the calculation. 

We
evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions and data used by the Company in developing the qualitative factors by comparing these data
points to internally developed and third-party sources, as well as other audit evidence gathered. 

Analytical
procedures were performed to evaluate the directional consistency of changes that occurred in the allowance for loan losses for loans
collectively evaluated for impairment. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2006.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

where it is estimated that we will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the terms of the loan agreement be recorded at the loan s fair value. Fair value may be determined based upon
the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or the fair value of the
collateral less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. 

Additional accounting
guidance allows us to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on an impaired loan. The guidance also requires additional
disclosures about how we estimate interest income related to our impaired loans. 

A loan is also considered
impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring TDR ). For this type of impaired loan, cash receipts
are typically applied to principal and interest receivable in accordance with the terms of the restructured loan agreement. Interest
income is recognized on these loans using the accrual method of accounting, provided they are performing in accordance with their
restructured terms. 

The allowance for loan
losses (the allowance is our estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is established
as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against
the allowance when we believe the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited
to the allowance. The allowance is evaluated on a regular basis and is based upon our periodic review of the collectability of
the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the
borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation
is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 

We believe that the allowance
is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio; however, there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods
will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required. No assurance can be
given that our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio, in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances,
will not require significant future additions to the allowance, thus adversely affecting our operating results. 

The allowance is also subject
to examination by regulatory agencies, which may consider factors such as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size
of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions and other adequacy tests. In addition, such regulatory agencies could require
us to adjust our allowance based on information available at the time of the examination. 

The methodology used to
determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, which is included in other liabilities, is inherently similar to the methodology
used to determine the allowance adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and
historical loss ratio. 

years for buildings and to years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
asset s useful life or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods when reasonably assured. The cost of maintenance
and repairs is charged to operating expense as incurred. 

Operating lease ROU assets
and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. The lease payments included in the present value are fixed payments and index-based variable lease payments. The Company
estimates the incremental borrowing rate, based on information available at the commencement of the lease, as most of the Company s
leases do not include an implicit rate. 

retail banking segment and therefore has not provided segment disclosures. 

In
March 2020, the FASB issued guidance that makes narrow-scope improvements to various aspects of the financial instrument guidance,
including the current expected credit losses (CECL) guidance issued in 2016. The amendments related to conforming amendments.
For public business entities, the amendments are effective upon issuance of this final ASU. For the amendments related to ASU
2016-13, public business entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer, excluding eligible smaller reporting companies (SRCs)
as defined by the SEC, should adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-13 during 2020. Early adoption will continue to be permitted. For
entities that have not yet adopted the guidance in ASU 2016-13, the effective dates and the transition requirements for these
amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASU 2016-13. 

The
Company is finalizing its evaluation of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and plans to adopt as of . The Company to-date
has sourced and tested required data from the Company s loan systems, tested data feeds to the model, contracted an
independent third party for model validation of the CECL model and process, determined appropriate segmentations of its portfolio,
selected a preliminary forecast period for reasonable and supportable forecasts, and has performed parallel runs of the model. The
Company is currently finalizing its assessment of current and forecasted macroeconomic factors, assumptions, testing, and
finalization of internal controls. The Company currently estimates a decrease in the allowance for loan losses between and
 upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the reserve for unfunded commitments. The Company will
finalize the adoption during the first quarter of 2023. 

In
March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings
and Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for creditors in
ASC 310-402 and amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs
by year of origination. The ASU also updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326 and adds enhanced
disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.
The amendments in ASU 2022-02 are effective upon the Company s adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

In
March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform
on Financial Reporting , which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference
rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB extended the sunset date of ASC 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
November 2021, the FASB added a topic to the Accounting Standards Codification, Government Assistance, to require certain annual
disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by
analogy to other accounting guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2021. The amendment became effective January 1, 2022 and did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements. 

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have
a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We
had million and million of loans pledged as collateral to secure funding with the Federal Reserve Bank FRB Discount Window at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

On
March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act was signed into law, which established
the Paycheck Protection Program PPP and allocated .0 billion of loans to be issued by financial institutions.
Under the program, the Small Business Administration SBA forgave loans, in whole or in part, made by approved
lenders to eligible borrowers for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the program. These
loans carried a fixed rate of and a term of , if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans were guaranteed
by the SBA and as long as the borrower submitted its loan forgiveness application within ten months of completion of the covered
period. The borrower was not required to make any payments until the forgiveness amount was remitted to the lender by the SBA.
The Bank received a processing fee from the SBA ranging from to based on the size of the loan. The fees are deferred and
amortized over the life of the loans in accordance with ASC 310-20. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement
Act PPP/ HCEA Act was signed into law on April 24, 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorized additional funding under
the CARES Act of .0 billion for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. On December 27, 2020, the
Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act Economic Aid Act was enacted, which reauthorized
lending under the PPP program through March 31, 2021, with an additional billion. Over the course of the PPP program, the
Bank extended loans with a total loan amount of million. Because these loans were guaranteed by the SBA and did
not undergo the Bank s typical underwriting process, they were not graded and did not have an associated allowance. 

Our
portfolio grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements
as scheduled. Our internal credit risk grading system is based on experience with similarly graded loans, industry best practices,
and regulatory guidance. Our portfolio is graded in its entirety, with the exception of the PPP loans. 

Our
internally assigned grades pursuant to the Board-approved lending policy are as follows: 

Excellent
 (1) The borrowing entity has more than adequate cash flow, unquestionable strength,
 strong earnings and capital, and where applicable, no overdrafts. 

Good
 (2) The borrowing entity has dependable cash flow, better than average financial
 condition, good capital and usually no overdrafts. 

Satisfactory
 (3) The borrowing entity has adequate cash flow, satisfactory financial condition,
 and explainable overdrafts (if any). 

Watch
 (4) The borrowing entity has generally adequate, yet inconsistent cash flow, cyclical
 earnings, weak capital, loan to/from stockholders, and infrequent overdrafts. The borrower
 has consistent yet sometimes unpredictable sales and growth. 

OAEM
 (5) The borrowing entity has marginal cash flow, occasional past dues, and frequent
 and unexpected working capital needs. 

Substandard
 (6) The borrowing entity has cash flow barely sufficient to service debt, deteriorated
 financial condition, and bankruptcy is a possibility. The borrowing entity has declining
 sales, rising costs, and may need to look for secondary source of repayment. 

Doubtful
 (7) The borrowing entity has negative cash flow. Survival of the business is at risk,
 full repayment is unlikely, and there are frequent and unexplained overdrafts. The borrowing
 entity shows declining trends and no operating profits. 

Loss
 (8) The borrowing entity has negative cash flow with no alternatives. Survival of
 the business is unlikely.

In
general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a troubled debt restructuring TDR if we, for
economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower that we would not
otherwise consider. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were 
TDRs with a balance of .0 million.
These TDRs were granted extended payment terms with no principal reduction. The structure of of
the loans changed to interest only. TDR was performing as agreed as of December 31, 2022, while the other TDR is not performing as agreed and we are considering further collection actions, including potential foreclosure proceedings. No other TDRs that were modified
within the previous twelve months defaulted during the following year for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and
2020. 

Regulatory
agencies, as set forth in the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with
Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), have encouraged financial
institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of
the effects of COVID-19. In this statement, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive
actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID- 19 and that the agencies will not criticize institutions
for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the revised statement provides that eligible loan modifications
related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Under Section 4013
of the CARES Act, banks may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if the modifications are related to COVID-19, executed
on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier
of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency. All short-term loan modifications made
on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not considered TDRs. Beginning
in March 2020, the Bank provided payment accommodations to customers, consisting of 60-day principal deferral to borrowers negatively
impacted by COVID-19. During 2020, the Bank processed approximately million in principal deferments to customers, with
an aggregate loan balance of million. The Bank did not process any principal deferments during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. The principal deferments represented of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The Bank has
examined the payment accommodations granted to borrowers in response to COVID-19 and classified loans, with an aggregate loan
balance of .0 million, that were granted payment accommodations as TDRs given the continued financial difficulty of the customer,
associated industry risk, and multiple deferral requests. All other borrowers were current prior to relief, were not experiencing
financial difficulty prior to COVID- 19, and the Bank determined they were not considered TDRs. As of December 31, 2021, of
the TDRs were removed from TDR status due to improvement in financial condition and sustained performance under the restructured
terms, TDRs were paid off through refinancing into new loans at market terms, and TDR was paid off. loans with a balance
of million remain in TDR status as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, of the customers that received payment accommodations
that were not classified as TDRs, customers, with an aggregate loan balance of million, have paid their loan in full as
of December 31, 2021. An additional loan was removed from TDR status during 2022. The remaining loan with a balance of million
is paying as agreed as of December 31, 2022. There are no loans that received payment accommodation past due greater than 30 days.
The Bank will continue to examine payment accommodations as requested by borrowers.

There
was a and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, associated
with the Company s state tax credits. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible and prior to their expiration governed by the income tax code. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods during which the
deferred income tax assets are expected to be deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize
the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amount
of the deferred income tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income during the carry forward period are reduced. 

The
Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or paid. 

The
Company has analyzed the tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns and concluded it has no liability related
to uncertain tax positions in accordance with applicable regulations.

letters of credit represent our obligation to a third-party contingent upon the failure by our customer to perform under the terms
of an underlying contract with the third party or obligates us to guarantee or stand as surety for the benefit of the third party.
The underlying contract may entail either financial or nonfinancial obligations and may involve such things as the shipment of
goods, performance of a contract, or repayment of an obligation. Under the terms of a standby letter, generally drafts will be
drawn only when the underlying event fails to occur as intended. We can seek recovery of the amounts paid from the borrower. Commitments
under standby letters of credit are usually for one year or less. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded no liability
for the current carrying amount of the obligation to perform as a guarantor; as such amounts are not considered material. The
maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments related to standby letters of credit at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was

are periodically granted to employees at a price not less than the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant. Employees
become 
vested after five years and then vest 
each year until fully vested. The right to exercise each such

Planning Committee will obtain approval from the Compensation Committee for any options granted to them. 

We
also have a stock incentive plan to provide equity incentive compensation to the Company s eligible independent directors. The
plan was approved by the shareholders in 2021 and has shares reserved. Under the 2021 plan, options may be granted to

Each independent director is eligible to participate in the 2021 plan if the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, determines
that such person has contributed or can be expected to contribute to our profits or growth. 

Option
awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s common stock at the date
of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes)
model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our common
stock. The expected term of the options granted shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant (the amount of time options
granted are expected to be outstanding). The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

Basel
III became effective on January 1, 2015 and its purpose is to improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital for all
banking organizations. The rule was phased in over a four-year period, with full implementation occurring on January 1, 2019. The
minimum requirements for the quantity and quality of capital were increased. The rule includes a new common equity Tier 1 capital
(as defined in the regulation) to risk-weighted assets ratio of 
and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 
of risk-weighted assets. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 
to 
and requires a minimum leverage ratio of .
In addition, the rule also implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and improves the methodology
for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. 

On
November 4, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule on an optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy
for qualifying community banking organizations called the community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework effective on
January 1, 2020. A qualifying community banking organization is defined as having less than 
billion in total consolidated assets, a leverage ratio greater than ,
off-balance sheet exposures of 
or less of total consolidated assets, and trading assets and liabilities of 
or less of total consolidated assets. Additionally, the qualifying community banking institution must be a non-advanced approaches
FDIC supervised institution. The final rule adopts Tier 1 capital and existing leverage ratio into the CBLR framework. The Bank
adopted this rule as of September 30, 2020 and is no longer subject to other capital and leverage requirements. Under the CBLR
framework, a qualifying community banking organization is deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements
and be in compliance with the generally applicable capital rule. As noted in the table below, the leverage ratio was below .0 at
December 31, 2021 and therefore we did not meet the "well capitalized" ratio requirements and was not in complinance.

believe that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject at December 31, 2022 and

Derivative
Instruments 

Derivative
instruments include interest rate lock commitments and forward sale commitments. These instruments are valued based on the change
in the value of the underlying loan between the commitment date and the end of the period. We classify these instruments as Level
3. 

We
had no embedded derivative instruments requiring separate accounting treatment. We had freestanding derivative instruments consisting
of fixed rate conforming loan commitments with interest rate locks and commitments to sell fixed rate conforming loans on a best-efforts
basis. We do not currently engage in hedging activities. Based on the short-term nature of mortgage loans to be sold (derivative
contract), our derivative instruments were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The
following paragraphs describe the valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 

Impaired
Loans 

Impaired
loans are carried at the lower of recorded investment or fair value. The fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to
sell is the most frequently used method. Typically, we review the most recent appraisal and, if it is over 12 to 18 months old,
we may request a new third party appraisal. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the loan, including the location
of the collateral, the date of the most recent appraisal and the value of the collateral relative to the recorded investment in
the loan, we may order an independent appraisal immediately or, in some instances, may elect to perform an internal analysis.
Specifically, as an example, in situations where the collateral on a nonperforming commercial real estate loan is out of our primary
market area, we would typically order an independent appraisal immediately, at the earlier of the date the loan becomes nonperforming
or immediately following the determination that the loan is impaired. 

However,
as a second example, on a nonperforming commercial real estate loan where we are familiar with the property and surrounding areas
and where the original appraisal value far exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, we may perform an internal analysis whereby
the previous appraisal value would be reviewed considering recent current conditions, and known recent sales or listings of similar
properties in the area, and any other relevant economic trends. This analysis may result in the call for a new appraisal. These
valuations are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. 

In
accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, impaired loans, where an allowance is established based on the fair value
of collateral, require classification in the fair value hierarchy. These impaired loans are classified as Level 3. Impaired loans
measured using discounted future cash flows are not deemed to be measured at fair value. 

Mortgage
Loans to be Sold 

Mortgage
loans to be sold are carried at the lower of cost or market value. The fair values of mortgage loans to be sold are based on current
market rates from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. Carrying value approximates fair
value. These loans are classified as Level 2.

There
were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. 

to for Sales Commissions and Other Holding Costs 

Accounting
standards require disclosure of fair value information for all of our assets and liabilities that are considered financial instruments,
whether or not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. 

Under
the accounting standard, fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value
of anticipated future business and the value of the assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments. Accordingly, the
aggregate fair value amounts of existing financial instruments do not represent the underlying value of those instruments on our
books. 

The
following paragraphs describe the methods and assumptions we use in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: 

a. Cash
 and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank 

The
carrying value approximates fair value. All instruments mature within 90 days and do not present unanticipated credit concerns. 

b. Investment
 securities available for sale 

Investment
securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices,
if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based
valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment
assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. 

c. Loans 

The
fair value of the Company s loan portfolio includes a credit risk assumption in the determination of the fair value of its
loans. This credit risk assumption is intended to approximate the fair value that a market participant would realize in a hypothetical
orderly transaction. The Company s loan portfolio is initially fair valued using a segmented approach. The Company divides
its loan portfolio into the following categories: variable rate loans, impaired loans and all other loans. The results are then
adjusted to account for credit risk as described above. However, under the new guidance, the Company believes a further credit
risk discount must be applied through the use of a discounted cash flow model to compensate for illiquidity risk, based on certain
assumptions included within the discounted cash flow model, primarily the use of discount rates that better capture inherent credit
risk over the lifetime of a loan. Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Liabilities , this consideration of enhanced credit risk provides an estimated exit price for the Company s loan
portfolio. 

For
variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values approximate carrying values.
Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. 

d. Deposits 

The
estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is equal to the carrying amount. The fair value of time deposits is estimated
by discounting contractual cash flows, using interest rates currently being offered on the deposit products. The fair value estimates
for deposits do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities as compared
to the cost of alternative forms of funding (deposit base intangibles). 

e. Accrued
 interest receivable and payable 

Since
these financial instruments will typically be received or paid within three months, the carrying amounts of such instruments are
deemed a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

f. Loan
 commitments 

Estimates
of the fair value of these off-balance sheet items are not made because of the short-term nature of these arrangements and the
credit standing on the counterparties.

 9A. Controls
 and Procedures 

An
evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) was carried out as of December 31, 2022
under the supervision and with the participation of the Bank of South Carolina Corporation s management, including its
President/Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer/Executive Vice President and several other members of the
Company s senior management. Based upon that evaluation, Bank of South Carolina Corporation s management, including the
President/Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer/Executive Vice President concluded that, as of December 31, 2022,
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information the Company is required to
disclose in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act has been (i) accumulated and communicated to management (including
the President/Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer/Executive Vice President) to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of published financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including the President/Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer/Executive Vice President, the Company s management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the 2013 framework established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting was effective. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report is not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to the final ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the Company to provide only
management s report in its annual report. 

The
Audit and Compliance Committee, composed entirely of independent Directors, meets periodically with management, the Company s
Audit Compliance Officer, and Elliott Davis, LLC (separately and jointly) to discuss audit, financial and related matters.
Elliott Davis, LLC and the Audit Compliance Officer have direct access to the Audit and Compliance Committee.

office to any other place within the limits of the County of Charleston, South Carolina, without the approval of the shareholders.

from time to time require, without the approval of the shareholders. 

ARTICLE
II - SHAREHOLDERS 

1. Annual
Meeting . 

The
regular annual meeting of the Shareholders shall be held on the second Tuesday of April in each year for the purpose of electing
Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting
shall be a legal or banking holiday in the State of South Carolina, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business
day. If the election of Directors shall not be held on the day designated herein for any annual meeting of the Shareholders, or
at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of the Shareholders
as soon thereafter as possible. 

2. Special
Meetings . 

Special
meetings of the Shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the President
or by a majority of the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the President at the request of the holders of not less than
ten (10 percent of all the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting. 

3. Place
of Meeting . 

The
Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, as the place of
meeting for any annual or for any special meeting called by the Directors. A waiver of notice signed by all Shareholders entitled
to vote at a meeting may designate any place, either within or without the State, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, as the
place for holding such meeting. If no designation is made or if a special meeting be otherwise called, the place of meeting shall
be the principal office of the Corporation. 

4. Notice
of Meeting . 

Written
or printed notice, stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting, and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten (10) days nor more than fifty (50) days before the date
of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the President or the Secretary or the officer or persons
calling the meeting, to each Shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to
be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the Shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock
transfer books of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. 

When
a meeting is adjourned, for whatever reason, for thirty (30) days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as provided
by this section. Notice of a meeting adjourned for less than thirty (30) days need not be given if the time and place of the adjourned
meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact
any business which might have been transacted at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken. 

5. Closing
of Transfer Books or Fixing of Record Date . 

For
the purpose of determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment thereof,
or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of Shareholders for any other
proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination
of Shareholders, such date, in any case, to be not more than fifty (50) days and, in case of a meeting of Shareholders, not less
than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of Shareholders, is to be taken.
If no record date is fixed for the determination of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders,
or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which
the Resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for
such determination of Shareholders. When a determination of Shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of Shareholders has been
made, as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, unless a new record date is fixed
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5. 

6. Voting
Lists . 

The
officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall, in advance of each meeting of
Shareholders, prepare a complete list of the Shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting of Shareholders or adjournment thereof.
Such lists shall be arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each Shareholder. The
requirement of a list shall be satisfied, and no list need be prepared, if the record of Shareholders readily shows, in alphabetical
order or by alphabetical index, and by classes or series, if any, the information required to appear in a list of Shareholders.
For a period commencing upon the date when notice of the meeting is given, and, in no event, less than ten (10) days prior to
the date of the meeting, such list of Shareholders shall be kept on file at the registered office of the Corporation or at its
principal place of business or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar, and shall be subject to inspection by any Shareholder
at any time during usual business hours.

of the existing management of the Corporation, shall be made in writing and shall be delivered or mailed to the President of the
Corporation, not less than fourteen (14) days nor more than fifty (50) days prior to any meeting of shareholders called for the
election of directors, provided, however, that if less than twenty-one (21) days notice of the meeting is given to shareholders,
such nomination shall be mailed or delivered to the President of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the seventh
(7th) day following the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed. Such notification shall contain the following information
to the extent known to the notifying shareholder: (a) the name and address of each proposed nominee; (b) the principal occupation
of each proposed nominee; (c) the total number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that will be voted for each proposed
nominee; (d) the name and residence address of the notifying shareholder; and (e) the number of shares of capital stock of the

8. Quorum . 

At
any meeting of Shareholders, fifty (50 percent of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in
person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the meeting of Shareholders. If less than said number of the outstanding shares
are presented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The Shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue
to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

all meetings of Shareholders, a Shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or his duly authorized attorney

Shares
standing in the name of a Shareholder-corporation may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy, as the by-laws of such Shareholder-corporation

In the absence of any such designation, the chairman of the board, president, any vice-president, secretary, and treasurer of
the Shareholder-corporation shall be presumed to possess, in that order, authority to vote such shares, unless prior to such vote,

exist or is vested in some other officer or person. In case of conflicting representation of the Shareholder-corporation, the
shares shall be voted by the senior officer, in the order stated. 

Shares

shares which stand of record in the name of the person for whom he is such fiduciary. 

A
minor may vote, in person or by proxy, shares which stand of record in his name, and may not thereafter disaffirm or avoid such
vote. 

Shares
held by a person as custodian for a minor under the South Carolina Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (Sections 20-7-140 to 20-7-270,
South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, as amended) may be voted by the custodian, subject to applicable provisions of that act. 

Shares
held by or under the control of a trustee in bankruptcy or receiver or liquidator, may be voted by him without the transfer thereof
into his name if authority to do so is conferred by statute or is authorized by the court which appointed such trustee, receiver,
or liquidator. An assignee for the benefit of creditors may vote shares standing in the name of the assignor, unless otherwise
provided in the instrument of assignment. 

A
shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred on the records
of the Corporation into the name of the pledgee or a nominee of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote
the shares so long as they stand of record in the pledgee s name. 

- 4 - 

Shares
standing in the name of a partnership may be voted by any partner and shares standing in the name of a limited partnership may
be voted by any general partner. 

Shares
standing in the name of a person as life tenant may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy. 

12. Informal
Action by Shareholders . 

Any
action required to be taken at a meeting of the Shareholders or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the Shareholders
may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the Shareholders
entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof, and is filed with the Secretary of the Corporation as part of the
corporate records. 

13. Cumulative
Voting . 

At
each election for Directors, every Shareholder entitled to vote at such election shall have the right to vote, in person or by
proxy, the number of shares owned by him for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election he has
a right to vote, or to cumulate his votes by giving one (1) candidate as many votes as the number of such Directors multiplied
by the number of his shares shall equal, or by distributing such votes on the same principal among any number of candidates. A
Shareholder who intends to vote his shares as provided in this Section shall either (1) give written notice of such intention
to the President or other officer of the Corporation not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time fixed for the meeting,
or (2) announce his intention in such meeting before the voting for Directors shall commence; and all Shareholders entitled to
vote at such meeting shall, without further notice, be entitled to cumulate their votes.

as they may deem proper, not inconsistent with these By-Laws, and the Laws of this State. 

2. Number,
Tenure, and Qualifications . 

The
initial number of Directors of the Corporation shall be nineteen (19). Each Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting

minimum of fifteen (15). Each Director, during the full term of his directorship, shall own a minimum of one hundred (100) shares
of unencumbered and unpledged shares of stock of this Corporation. 

3. Regular
Meetings . 

A
regular meeting of the Directors shall be held, without other notice than this By-Law, immediately after and at the same place
at the annual meeting of Shareholders. The Directors may provide, by Resolution, the time and place for the holding of additional
regular meetings without other notice than such Resolution. 

4. Special
Meetings . 

Special
meetings of the Directors may be called by or at the request of the President of the Corporation or by a majority of the Directors.

United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. If notice be given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to
be delivered when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company. Notice of a meeting of Directors need not be given to a
Director who signs a waiver of notice, either before or after the meeting. Attendance of a Director at a meeting shall, of itself,
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting
at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. 

- 6 - 

6. Quorum .

 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES

Bank of South Carolina Corporation 10-K 

E xhibit
4.1 

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 

 REGISTERED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE 

 SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

The
following description sets forth certain material terms and provisions of the securities of Bank of South Carolina Corporation
(the Company, we, us, or our that are registered under Section 12 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The following summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of our articles of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated
bylaws, copies of which are filed with or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this
Exhibit 4.1 is a part. We encourage you to read our articles of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws
for additional information. 

Description
of Common Stock, No Par Value per Share 

General.
 Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share, to receive dividends when and if declared by our Board of
Directors and to share ratably in the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to our shareholders in the event
of liquidation. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. All outstanding
shares of our common stock are, upon issuance and payment therefor, duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. The holders
of our common stock have cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, subject to certain advance notice
requirements set forth in the bylaws and applicable provisions of the South Carolina Business Corporation Act. Directors are elected
by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. On
all other matters, assuming a quorum is present and unless otherwise provided by law, action on a matter is approved if the votes
cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. 

The
issuance of additional shares of our common stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control
of the Company. 

Dividends.
 As a South Carolina corporation, we are not directly subject to the restrictions on the payment of cash dividends applicable
to our subsidiary bank. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve has issued a
policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve s view
that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company s net income for the past
year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the holding company s
capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 

Holders
of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such cash dividends as the board of directors may declare out of legally
available funds. However, our payment of cash dividends will be subject to the restrictions of South Carolina law applicable to
the declaration of distributions to shareholders by a business corporation. Under such provisions, distributions, including cash
dividends, may not be paid if, after giving effect to such cash dividend or other distribution, a corporation would not be able
to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than
the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy certain preferential liquidation rights. Our
ability to pay cash dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock is, at the present time and for the foreseeable future,
largely dependent upon the amount of cash dividends that our subsidiary bank pays to us. 

1 

Regulatory
Restrictions on Ownership . The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA ), requires any bank
holding company, as defined in the BHCA, to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring 5 or more of our
common stock. Any person, other than a bank holding company, is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before
acquiring 10 or more of our common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act. Generally, any company (as defined under the BHCA)
that owns or controls 25 or more of our common stock, or a company that owns or controls 5 or more if such company otherwise
exercises a controlling influence over us, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the BHCA. 

Charter
and Bylaw Provisions Having Potential Anti-Takeover Effects 

The
following paragraphs summarize certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws
that may have the effect, or be used as a means, of delaying or preventing attempts to acquire or take control of the Company,
or to remove or replace incumbent directors, that are not first approved by our board of directors, even if those proposed actions
are favored by our shareholders. All references to our articles of incorporation reference such articles as amended to date. 

Authorized
Shares . Our Board of Directors is authorized to approve the issuance of shares of our common stock from time to time. Our
Board of Directors has considerable flexibility to effect, among other transactions, financings, acquisitions, stock dividends,
stock splits, and grants of stock options. However, the board s authority also could be used, consistent with the board s
fiduciary duty, to deter future attempts to gain control of the Company by issuing additional common stock to persons friendly
to management in order to attempt to block a tender offer, merger, or other transaction by which a third party seeks to gain control. 

Advance
Notice of Director Nominations . Our bylaws provide that in order to be eligible for consideration at a meeting of shareholders,
all nominations for election to the Board of Directors, other than those made by our nominating committee, must be made in writing
and delivered or mailed to the President/Chief Executive Officer of the Company not less than 14 days or no more than 50 days
prior to any meeting of shareholders calling for election of directors; provided however, that if less than 21 days notice
of the meeting is given to shareholders, such nomination shall be mailed or delivered to the President/Chief Executive Officer
of the Company not later than the close of business on the 7th day following the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed.
Only shareholders entitled to vote in the election for directors may make nominations to our Board of Directors. 

2 

Special
Meetings of Shareholders . Our bylaws provide that, unless otherwise prescribed by law, special meetings of our shareholders
(1) may be called only by (a) a majority of our Board of Directors, or (b) the president of the Company, and (2) shall be called
by the president of the Company at the request of holders of not less than ten percent (10 of all the outstanding shares of
the Company entitled to vote at such a meeting. 

Removal
of Directors; Filling Vacancies. Our bylaws provide that any or all of our directors may be removed for cause by vote of the
shareholders or by action of the Board of Directors. Directors may be removed without cause only by vote of the shareholders.
Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors
for any reason, except the removal of directors without cause, may be filled by a vote of a majority of the directors then in
office. Vacancies occurring by reason of the removal of directors without cause must be filled by vote of the shareholders. A
director elected to fill a vacancy caused by resignation, death, or removal shall be elected to hold office for the unexpired
term of his or her predecessor. 

Amendment
of Bylaws . Our bylaws provide that the holders of a majority of shares entitled to elect directors may alter, amend, or repeal
the bylaws or adopt new bylaws, provided that the Board of Directors may alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws or adopt new bylaws,
subject to the right of the shareholders as stated above to alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws or adopt new bylaws.
