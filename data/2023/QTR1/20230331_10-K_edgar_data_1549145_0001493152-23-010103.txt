ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Background 

Business
Overview 

Blue
Biofuels, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on March 28, 2012, as Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. Since December 2013, Blue Biofuels,
Inc. (the Company has been a technology company focused on emerging technologies in renewable energy, biofuels, and lignin. 

In
early 2018, the Company s chief executive officer CEO Ben Slager invented a new technology system referred to as
Cellulose-to-Sugar or CTS, and the Company filed a process patent application for this technology. Mr. Slager has since further developed
the system with laboratory personnel. The CTS patent was awarded in 2021 in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 10,994,255) and also in
El Salvador. The Company also filed an application for this patent in other major jurisdictions of the world including the European Patent
Organization, Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, and the Russian Federation. The
patent applications are currently pending in all of these international jurisdictions. In addition to this patent, the Company has received
one additional patent (for which it has also applied for in all the above mentioned jurisdictions), one continuation patent pending,
and provisional patent applications for two additional patents that are currently pending. 

Mr.
Slager has since further developed the system with the technical staff of the Company. The patented CTS process is a continuous mechanical/chemical
dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar and lignin, as compared to the prior batch process that the Company previously
licensed. The CTS process creates molecular contact between two reactive solid components instead of other systems where the reaction
takes place between two liquid or gas components in a batch process. The reactants are (1) the feedstock, which is broken down into its
components being sugars and lignin; (2) a catalyst, which is cost effective and abundantly available in the market from regular suppliers;
it is separated from reactor components and reused. The CTS mechanical/chemical process allows for exact process control to ensure that
all the material passing through it does so on the optimum reaction parameters through which optimal efficiency is achieved. 

CTS
is different from other commercial processes that are used to convert cellulose into sugar. Other processes use enzymatic batch reactors
that take up to weeks to convert cellulose to sugars. CTS can convert any cellulosic material including grasses and agricultural
waste into sugars in less than a minute of conversion time. The sugars are subsequently processed into biofuels using off-the-shelf
technologies. CTS is environmentally friendly in that it recycles the water and catalyst, and it has a near zero carbon footprint: the
amount of added atmospheric carbon created by burning the biofuels produced by the CTS system was absorbed by the plant-based feedstock
while growing and is merely released back into the atmosphere. No extra CO2 is released into the atmosphere in our system. This is to
be distinguished from fossil fuels because new CO2 is released when fossil fuels are burned. 

The
CTS system converts plant-based feedstock into one primary product, soluble sugars, which can be further processed into cellulosic ethanol
and other biofuels like jet fuel, and potentially into bio chemicals. 

CTS
has different co-products than other processes. Our primary co-product is pure lignin. Other industries like the paper industry produce
lignin that is contaminated by chemicals like sulfur. Other cellulosic ethanol processes do not yield chemically clean high purity lignin
because their processes chemically alter or contaminate the lignin. Most ethanol producers use corn, not cellulose, and the co-products
of corn ethanol production are distillers grains animal feed and corn oil. Our lignin can potentially be used in ion exchange resins
or specialty chemicals. Lignin can also be burned as a renewable fuel. 

At
a commercial scale, our management expects to be able to produce ethanol at a lower cost per gallon than existing commercial corn or
cellulosic ethanol producers due to the fact that the CTS process is robust, uncomplicated and efficient, and is expected to use low-cost
feedstocks and have a potentially high value by-product. We believe a significant difference between CTS ethanol and corn ethanol is
the wide range of abundantly available feedstocks that CTS can process compared to just corn as the feedstock. The CTS feedstocks are
nonfood and have much lower costs than corn. In addition, while in corn ethanol only the corn kernels are used, CTS uses the whole plant
or its waste products, meaning it could obtain much higher yields per acre. Estimated yields for corn are about 400-600 gallons of ethanol
per acre per year and for king grass in conjunction with our CTS process it could be up to 3000-3500 gallons per acre per year. The Company
also expects to potentially receive a highly valued D3 RIN for each gallon of ethanol it produces. 

3 

The
promise of the then newly developed CTS technology made it worthwhile to financially restructure the Company through Chapter 11 in 2018.
Prior management had taken on various toxic notes other debts that the Company could not pay at that time. The Company s
new board and management determined that a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was its only plausible alternative to save the company as a going
concern for the benefit of creditors and stockholders. The Company voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 on October 22, 2018, in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida. Management fought, eliminated, and restructured millions in debts and disputed
debts, and exited Chapter 11 on September 18, 2019, while keeping all classes, including the shareholders, unimpaired. The Company s
debts were either voided, renegotiated down and paid off, or renegotiated to be paid out of future revenues 1,820,630) or renegotiated
to be paid out of future profits 917,502). These are reflected on the Company s financial statements. A complete copy of the
Plan of Reorganization was filed as Exhibit 2(a) of the Company s 2020 financial statements. Having paid all debts that needed
to be paid, the bankruptcy case was closed on October 25, 2019. 

The
Company has built several prototypes of the CTS system to further develop the process. The Company finalized its parameter optimization
when it was able to convert 99 of the cellulosic material into soluble sugars suitable for further processing into cellulosic ethanol.
In 2022, the Company partnered with K.R. Komarek to build its CTS machines going forward. Komarek is an industry leading manufacturing
company that builds briquetting machines and compaction/granulation systems with throughput capacities up to 50 tons per hour. 

The
Company has begun successful testing on a Komarek-made machine at a throughput processing rate of 2.5 tons per day. The Company has designed
a pilot plant around that machine and is in the process of completing the buildout of the plant. The Company anticipates having the pilot
plant completed in Q1, 2023 and anticipates to continue testing it and optimizing parameters and sugar production in the first half of
2023. This pilot plant is designed to show successful volume production and scalability. 

The
Company expects to engage an engineering firm to design a semi-commercial scale pilot plant that integrates a larger CTS system into
the pre-processing and post-processing elements of the plant. It is anticipated that the semi-commercial plant will have the capacity
to produce sugar at a rate sufficient to make around 500,000 1,000,000 gallons of ethanol per year. The goal of the semi-commercial
plant is to provide operating cost estimates of a full commercial volume system. Due to its mechanical nature and modularity, we anticipate
that one plant would have multiple modular CTS systems, and that the semi-commercial plant would contain one such module. The Company
expects to have the semi-commercial system ready in 2024. 

Commencing
commercial production will require project financing. The project financing will either be for bolting on our CTS system into an existing
ethanol facility of a future potential joint venture partner, or for acquiring an ethanol facility and converting that to cellulosic
ethanol production using our CTS system, or for setting up a production facility for converting ethanol into jet fuel using the Vertimass
Process that the Company has licensed. 

The
Company has licensed the Vertimass Process to convert ethanol (from the CTS process) into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). There is no
up-front or annual fee until we are converting ethanol into SAF. The license agreement with Vertimass is the subject of a confidentiality
agreement between the parties. The Company aims to start engineering of a first pilot plant to convert up to 500,000 gallons of ethanol
into jet fuel and other fuels. 

The
Company s strategy is to diversify its product portfolio to include a number of product lines. These potentially include (1) biofuels
 such as ethanol, or converting ethanol into higher biofuels like sustainable aviation fuel and the like; (2) selling sulfur-free
lignin to ion exchange resin producers; and (3) making specialty chemicals from lignin. We believe these, and other markets, could potentially
provide for highly profitable products. 

Management
believes that retrofitting existing plants with the CTS technology or delivering cellulosic sugar to existing ethanol plants to enable
them to make cellulosic ethanol, may achieve more rapid commercialization than building new plants. After its first plant is profitable,
the Company intends to grow with additional plants in the United States and explore international growth by either licensing the technology
or forming joint ventures with foreign domestic partners to build plants. 

4 

The
ethanol industry is competitive with over 200 ethanol plants in the United States alone. Currently, the vast majority use corn as the
feedstock. Their profitability depends highly on the fluctuations between the price of corn and the price of ethanol. Since the Company
does not plan to use corn, and plans on having long-term purchase agreements with cellulosic suppliers, we anticipate that our profitability
will be more consistent. 

Any
new biofuels plant that is built would require various government permits. In particular, renewable fuels are subject to rigorous testing
and premarket approval requirements by the EPA s Office of Transportation and Air Quality and regulatory authorities in other countries.
In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, storage
and use of renewable fuels. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes
and regulations requires the expenditure of resources. The Company anticipates raising the necessary capital for this as a part of its
project-based financing. 

The
Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included the Renewable Fuel Standard Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
mandates a certain amount of renewable fuel be blended into the transportation fuel used by all vehicles in the country. This Program
provides monetary incentives to companies that produce renewable transportation fuel, and establishes Renewable Identification Numbers
(RINs) or credits for each gallon of renewable transportation fuel produced in the United States, and breaks down those fuels into different
D-codes depending on the source of the renewable fuel. D3 is the code for renewable ethanol that comes from cellulosic materials. The
EPA s current RIN volume targets for cellulosic ethanol include 720 million gallons for 2023, 1.42 billion gallons for 2024, and
2.13 billion gallons for 2025 (the D3 mandate). This mandate has increased every year and is statutorily mandated to increase in the
future and become a larger portion of the full renewable fuels mandate, if and when cellulosic biofuels can be produced profitably in
larger quantities than they are now. The RFS mandate for 2022 called for 20.77 billion gallons of total renewable fuel, 15 billion from
conventional biofuels (corn ethanol) and 5.77 billion from advanced biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels. The blend wall 
(or upper limit to the amount of ethanol that can be blended into U.S. gasoline and automobile performance and comply with the Clean
Air Act) of limiting ethanol content in gasoline to 10 , limits the total amount of ethanol consumed in the United States. Recent proposals
may make 15 blending available year around. The value of the D3 RIN fluctuates, but as of this filing, it is approximately 1.95 per
gallon of ethanol. To profit from these incentives, the Company plans to apply for these D3 RIN credits as it brings its first plant
into commercial operation. 

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization.
As of this date, the Company has not generated any material revenues from its business.

as applicable, may exercise any Stock Option granted to him or her to the extent that such Stock Option is exercisable on the date of
such death or disability. All outstanding and unexercised Stock Options of an option holder will be cancelled in the event that such
person ceases to be an Eligible Person by reason of cause. 

Stock
Appreciation Rights may be granted either on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with all or part of any Stock Option granted under
the Plan. Stock Appreciation Rights granted on a stand-alone basis may be exercisable only at such time or times and to such extent as
determined by the administrator of the Plan. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in conjunction with all or part of any Stock Option may
be exercisable only at the time or times and to the extent that the Stock Options to which they relate are exercisable. Upon the exercise
of a Stock Appreciation Right, a holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, Purchaser Shares or both, which in the aggregate
is equal in value to the difference in the fair market value of the Purchaser Shares at the date of exercise less the fair market value
of the Purchaser Shares at the date of grant. 

Stock
Awards may be directly issued under the Plan, subject to such terms, conditions, performance requirements, restrictions, forfeiture provisions,
contingencies and limitations as the administrator of the Plan may determine. 

Subject
to adjustment as provided in the Plan, the aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be delivered under the Plan shall not
exceed a number equal to 15 of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. The maximum number of shares of common stock
which may be delivered under the Plan shall automatically increase by a number sufficient to cause the number of shares of common stock
covered by the Plan to equal 15 of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding, assuming for this purpose the conversion
into common stock of all outstanding securities that are convertible by their terms (directly or indirectly) into common stock. The exercise
price per share of common stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall be determined by the administrator of the Plan; provided, however,
that the exercise price per share shall be not less than the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) per share on the date the Stock
Option is granted, or if the Stock Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option and is granted to an individual who is
a Ten Percent Holder (as defined in the Plan), not less than 110 of such Fair Market Value per share. The term of each Stock Option
shall be fixed by the administrator of the Plan, but no Incentive Stock Option shall be exercisable more than 10 years (or five years
in the case of an individual who is a Ten Percent Holder) after the date the Incentive Stock Option is granted.

cautionary statement. 

Business
Overview 

Blue
Biofuels, Inc (the Company is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy, biofuels,
and bioplastics technologies sectors. 

In
early 2018, our chief executive officer CEO Ben Slager invented a new technology system referred to as Cellulose-to-Sugar
or CTS, and the Company filed, and received, two patents for this technology. The CTS process is a continuous mechanical/chemical dry
process for converting cellulose material into sugar and lignin. 

The
CTS system converts plant-based feedstock into one primary product, soluble sugars, which can be further processed into cellulosic ethanol
and other biofuels like jet fuel, and potentially into bio chemicals. 

The
primary co-product of the CTS system is sulfur-free lignin. Our lignin potentially can be used in ion exchange resins or specialty chemicals.
Lignin can also be burned as a renewable fuel. 

In
2022, the Company partnered with K.R. Komarek to build its CTS machines going forward. Komarek is an industry leading manufacturing company
that builds briquetting machines and compaction/granulation systems with throughput capacities up to 50 tons per hour. The Company has
begun successful testing on a Komarek-made machine at a throughput processing rate of 2.5 tons per day. The Company has designed a pilot
plant around that machine and is in the process of completing the buildout of the plant. We anticipate having the pilot plant completed
in Q1, 2023 and anticipate to continue testing it and optimizing parameters and sugar production in the first half of 2023. This pilot
plant is designed to show successful volume production and scalability. 

The
Company expects to engage an engineering firm to design a semi-commercial scale pilot plant that integrates a larger CTS system into
the pre-processing and post-processing elements of the plant. It is anticipated that the semi-commercial plant will have the capacity
to produce sugar at a rate sufficient to make around 500,000 1,000,000 gallons of ethanol per year. The goal of the semi-commercial
plant is to provide operating cost estimates of a full commercial volume system. Due to its mechanical nature and modularity, we anticipate
that one plant would have multiple modular CTS systems, and that the semi-commercial plant would contain one such module. The Company
expects to have the semi-commercial system ready in 2024. 

10 

Plan
of Operation 

The
Company s strategy is to diversify its product portfolio to include a number of product lines. These potentially include (1) biofuels
 such as ethanol, or converting ethanol into higher biofuels like jet-fuel and the like; (2) selling sulfur-free lignin to ion
exchange resin producers; or, (3) using the sugars and lignin to make biochemicals. We believe that one or more of these co-products
could potentially be profitable for the Company. 

Our
goal is to develop our CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to either enter into a joint venture with or acquire existing
corn ethanol plants to install the CTS technology. The Company is also looking into converting ethanol to jet fuel. To minimize dilution
to shareholders, we will seek project-based financing to build (or acquire and retrofit) or joint venture with existing ethanol producers
to produce cellulosic ethanol and lignin and other specialty chemicals from our CTS system. We believe retrofitting existing plants with
the CTS technology may achieve more rapid commercialization than building new plants. If its first plant is profitable, the Company intends
to grow with additional plants in the United States and explore international growth by either licensing the technology or forming joint
ventures with foreign domestic partners to build plants ourselves. 

The
Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included the Renewable Fuel Standard Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA ),
mandates a certain amount of renewable fuel be blended into the transportation fuel used by all vehicles in the country. This Program
provides monetary incentives to companies that produce renewable transportation fuel, and establishes Renewable Identification Numbers RINs or credits for each gallon of renewable transportation fuel produced in the United States, and breaks down those
fuels into different D-codes depending on the source of the renewable fuel. D3 is the code for renewable ethanol that comes from cellulosic
materials. (D6 is for corn ethanol). The value of the D3 RIN fluctuates, but as of this filing, it is approximately 1.95 per gallon
of ethanol. To profit from these incentives, the Company plans to apply for these D3 RIN credits as it brings its first plant into commercial
operation. 

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization.
As of this date, the Company has generated 194,319 in revenue, however it has not generated any revenues from its core business.

Results
of Operations 

Comparison
of the year ended December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2021 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized 0 in revenue and also 0 in 2021. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s general and administrative expenses increased by 507,011 to 1,541,959 from 1,034,948
in 2021. This increase is primarily due to the vesting and expensing of options in 2022 valued at 526,636, as compared to 31,104 non-cash
stock compensation in 2021. 

Interest
expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2022 by 4,366 to 29,406 from 33,772 in 2021. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a loan forgiveness of 0 versus 66,330 in 2021. 

Research
and Development 

The
Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the amounts charged
to research and development expenses were 2,350,218 and 1,103,436, respectively. The increase is largely due to the vesting of options
in 2022 valued at 1,038,953, versus 0 in 2021. 

11 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had 211,901 in cash and total stockholders equity December 31, 2022, was negative 2,356,917.
As of December 31, 2021 the Company had 1,164,664 in cash and total stockholders equity at December 31, 2021 was negative 1,396,046.
Total debt, including advances, accounts payable and other notes payable at December 31, 2022, together with interest payable thereon
and contingent liabilities, was 3,462,835 an increase of 228,542 from December 31, 2021, where it stood at 3,234,293. This increase
is primarily attributable to a renewal of the lease which increased liabilities by 108,809. 2,738,132 of the remaining debt was renegotiated
to be payable out of future revenue or future profits and otherwise does not come due. 

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s operating expenses increased 1,760,408 to 3,932,276 from 2,171,868 in
2021. This increase can primarily be attributed to equity based compensation of 1,565,589 in 2022 due to the vesting of options. 

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s investing activities used 205,502 in cash. This can be attributed to 138,170
used to purchase machinery and equipment, and 67,350 in patent costs. These are to be compared with 233,132 in cash used in fiscal
year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of 216,390 used to purchase machinery and equipment, and 16,742 in patent expenses. 

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated an aggregate of 1,288,900 through its financing activities, which is
a decrease of 2,287,567 from 3,576,467 raised during fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease from the prior year can be
attributed to 1,168,000 raised in private placements as compared to 2,260,750 in 2021, and 120,900 received from the exercise of warrants
as compared to 1,315,717 in 2021. 

Capital
Resources 

At
this time, the Company has limited liquidity and capital resources. To continue funding its operations, the Company will need to generate
revenue or obtain additional financing for current and future operations. The Company anticipates needing around 15 million to optimize
and scale up its CTS system to be commercially ready. The Company anticipates reaching this stage in around 12-18 months. There is no
guarantee that we will achieve all of the additional funding that is needed. 

As
of the date of filing, the Company has raised 655,001 through a private placement and the exercise of warrants in 2023, 1,288,900 in
2022, through the issuance of common stock and the exercise of warrants and options, in addition to 14,826,952 raised through the end
of 2021 through its private placement offerings, and in addition to capital raised through debt or convertible notes. However, there
is no guarantee that the company will be able to raise any additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company. 

The
inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company to implement
its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to re-evaluate and revise
its operations. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company has incurred losses since inception, and it may be unable to raise further capital. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a working
capital deficit of 383,700 and had incurred accumulated losses of 52,781,586 since its inception. The Company expects to incur significant
additional losses in connection with its continued start-up activities. As disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, there is
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and its need
to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient
revenues from its operations to pay its operating expenses. 

Equity 

As
of December 31, 2022, shareholders equity was negative (2,356,917). 

There
were 289,941,623 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 

There
were no preferred shares outstanding. 

The
Company has paid no dividends.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the U.S. U.S. GAAP and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company s majority-owned
subsidiaries over which the Company exercised control, if any, and there are currently none. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its then-existing subsidiaries, after elimination
of intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but has the ability to
exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. The Company s proportionate
share of net income or loss of the entity is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the dates presented and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Significant
estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates of impairment assessment
of identifiable intangible assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Estimates are based on past experience and other considerations
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Stock
Compensation 

The
Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payments under the relevant authoritative accounting guidance. Share-based payments include
any remuneration paid by the Company in shares of the Company s common stock or financial instruments that grant the recipient
the right to acquire shares of the Company s common stock. For share-based payments to employees, which consist only of awards
made under the stock option plan described below, the Company accounts for the payments in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic
718, Stock Compensation (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)). Share-based payments to consultants, service providers
and other non-employees are accounted for under in accordance with ASC Topic 718, ASC Topic 505, Equity Payments to Non-Employees 
or other applicable authoritative guidance. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may
not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable,
the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows, excluding interest costs, expected
to be generated by the asset group and their ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
value, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value
of the asset group. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. The
Company monitors its investment for impairment at least annually and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value if it determines
that an impairment charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information.

Biofuels, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Biofuels, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated the financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has not generated any significant revenue since inception and has incurred losses since inception. As of December
31, 2022, the Company has incurred losses of 52,781,586. The Company expects to incur significant additional losses and liabilities
in connection with its start-up and commercialization activities. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern. Continuation as a going concern is dependent on the ability to raise additional capital
and financing, though there is no assurance of success. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. The Company expects to incur significant
additional losses and liabilities in connection with its start-up and commercialization activities. These factors, among others, raise
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become
due and to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to pay its operating expenses. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability and classifications of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result
from this uncertainty. There are no assurances that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

Management
believes that the Company s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash from operating
activities, and obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations,
or sell additional shares of stock or borrow additional funds. The Company s inability to obtain additional cash could have a material
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, and its ability to continue in existence. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel
and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to shelter-in-place, and created significant disruption
of the financial markets. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how
it will impact our supply chain, employees, and potential future customers. Our office and lab have remained open during the pandemic.
Nevertheless, the pandemic slowed our ability to commercialize our process in two ways: by adversely affecting our ability to raise capital,
and by adversely affecting the supply chain of laboratory equipment and various parts of upgrades to our CTS system, which slowed the
development of our prototypes. Supply chain issues also delayed the delivery of various parts of our pilot plant. The extent to which
our operations may be further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain
and cannot be accurately predicted. We may experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including
as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), access to supplies, capital, and fundamental support services (such as shipping
and transportation). Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due
to any resulting economic recession or depression. Furthermore, the effects of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and
the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.

As
of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had approximately and of Federal net operating loss carryovers NOLs to offset taxable income, if any, in future years which begin to expire in . . 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment,
management has established a full valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because
it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

There
were no changes in the Company s independent registered accounting firm, nor any disagreements between the Company and its independent
registered accounting firm. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures
refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision
of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as of December 31, 2022. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficient. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)).
The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, the Company determined that there were no control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses. The Company has an independent
financial expert on its Audit Committee and an Audit Committee consisting entirely of independent directors; the Company backs up all
financial data and material agreements in the cloud so that in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to fire or other unmitigated
factors, the Company should still retain all of its material financial data and agreements. 

As
a result, management has concluded that the Company maintains effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Material
weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we discover such conditions, we intend to
remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation, as needed. 

All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The Company has an independent financial expert
on its Audit Committee, and the Company now backs up all financial data and material agreements in the cloud so that in the event of
theft, misplacement, or loss due to fire or other unmitigated factors, the Company should still retain all of its material financial
data and agreements. In addition, the Company now has multiple persons reviewing and reconciling the bank account and our financial data. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

over 725 biodigesters impacting more than 94 of the qualifying concentrated animal feeding operations in Mexico and Brazil. The construction
and operation of these biodigesters dramatically improved each farms local environment impact while also lowering their carbon intensity.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

The
Company s board of directors has a compensation committee consisting entirely of independent directors, with Peter Zimeri as chair
and Edmund Burke and Charles Sills as the other members. The Company s compensation philosophy is based on its belief that its
compensation programs should be aligned with stockholders interests and business objectives; reward performance; and be externally
competitive and internally equitable. The Company seeks to achieve three objectives, which serve as guidelines in making compensation
decisions: 

1. 
 Providing a total compensation
 package which is competitive and therefore enables it to attract and retain, high-caliber executive personnel; 

2. 
 Integrating compensation
 programs with its short-term and long-term strategic plan and business objectives; and 

3. 
 Encouraging achievement
 of business objectives and enhancement of stockholder value by providing executive management log-term incentive through equity ownership. 

The
Company may compensate its officers with cash compensation, common stock and common stock options. The Company has not established any
quantifiable criteria with respect to the level of compensation, stock grants or options. Rather, the Board of Directors and its compensation
committee will evaluate cash, stock grants and stock options paid to executives in similarly situated companies. 

With
respect to stock grants and options which may be issued to the Company s officers and directors, the Board and its compensation
committee will consider an overall compensation package that includes both cash and stock-based compensation which would be in line with
the Company s overall operations and compensation levels paid to similarly situated companies. Under the Company s 2012 Employee,
Director Stock Plan, the administrator can provide for the grant of non-qualified stock options Non-Qualified Stock Options ),
incentive stock options ISOs , together with Non-Qualified Stock Options referred to herein as Stock Options ),
stock appreciation rights SARs ), restricted stock Restricted Stock and registered stock Registered
