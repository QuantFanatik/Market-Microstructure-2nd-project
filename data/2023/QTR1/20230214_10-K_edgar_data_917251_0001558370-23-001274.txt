 PART I Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words anticipate, estimate, should, expect, believe, intend, may, will, seek, could, project or similar expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Company s control and which could materially affect the Company s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance or future achievements or events. Currently, one of the most significant factors, however, is the adverse effect of macroeconomic conditions and of the current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, on the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance of the Company and its tenants, the real estate market and the global economy and financial markets. The extent to which macroeconomic trends and COVID-19 impact the Company and its tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in this report, as well as the risks set forth below, as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of macroeconomic conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: changes in general economic, financial and real estate market conditions; the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, tenants under their leases and the potential resulting vacancies; the Company s concentration with certain tenants and in certain markets, which may make the Company more susceptible to adverse events; changes in the Company s business strategy; risks that the Company s acquisition and development projects will fail to perform as expected; adverse changes and disruption in the retail sector and the financing stability of the Company s tenants, which could impact tenants ability to pay rent and expense reimbursement; the Company s ability to pay dividends; risks relating to information technology and cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other related business disruptions; loss of key management personnel; the potential need to fund improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flow; financing risks, such as the inability to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all; the level and volatility of interest rates; the Company s ability to renew or re-lease space as leases expire; limitations in the Company s tenants leases on real estate tax, insurance and operating cost reimbursement obligations; loss or bankruptcy of one or more of the Company s major tenants, and bankruptcy laws that may limit the Company s remedies if a tenant becomes bankrupt and rejects its leases; potential liability for environmental contamination, which could result in substantial costs; the Company s level of indebtedness, which could reduce funds available for other business purposes and reduce the Company s operational flexibility; covenants in the Company s credit agreements and unsecured notes, which could limit the Company s flexibility and adversely affect its financial condition; credit market developments that may reduce availability under the Company s revolving credit facility; an increase in market interest rates which could raise the Company s interest costs on existing and future debt; a decrease in interest rates, which may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate or adversely affect the Company s results of operations; the Company s hedging strategies, which may not be successful in mitigating the Company s risks associated with interest rates; legislative or regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing real estate investment trusts REITs the Company s ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and the limitations imposed on its business by its status as a REIT; and the Company s failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect the Company s operations and ability to make distributions. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the terms registrant, the Company, Agree Realty, we, our or us refer to Agree Realty Corporation and all of its consolidated subsidiaries, including its majority owned operating partnership, Agree Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership ). Agree Realty has elected to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries which are collectively referred to herein as the TRS.

 Item 1: Business General The Company is a fully integrated REIT primarily focused on the ownership, acquisition, development and management of retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants. The Company was founded in 1971 by its current Executive Chairman, Richard Agree, and its common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE in 1994. The Company s assets are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, directly or indirectly, the Operating Partnership of which the Company is the sole general partner and in which it held a 99.6 common interest as of December 31, 2022. Under the agreement of limited partnership of the Operating Partnership, the Company, as the sole general partner, has exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s portfolio consisted of 1,839 properties located in 48 states and totaling approximately 38.1 million square feet of Gross Leasable Area GLA ). The portfolio was approximately 99.7 leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 8.8 years. A significant majority of the Company s properties are leased to national tenants and approximately 67.8 of our annualized base rent was derived from tenants, or parent entities thereof, with an investment grade credit rating from S P Global Ratings, Moody s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Substantially all of our tenants are subject to net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 76 full-time employees, covering acquisitions, development, legal, asset management, accounting, finance, administrative and executive functions. The Company was incorporated in December 1993 under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Company believes that it has operated, and it intends to continue to operate, in such a manner to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ). In order to maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company must, among other things, distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income each year and meet asset and income tests. Additionally, its charter limits ownership of the Company, directly or constructively, by any single person to 9.8 of the value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of its outstanding common stock and 9.8 of the value of the aggregate of all of its outstanding stock, subject to certain exceptions. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income that is distributed currently to its stockholders. The Company s principal executive offices are located at 70 E. Long Lake Road, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48304 and its telephone number is (248) 737-4190. The Company s website is www.agreerealty.com. The Company s reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and can be accessed through this site, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such reports. These filings are also available on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. The Company s website also contains copies of its corporate governance guidelines and code of business conduct and ethics, as well as the charters of its audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees. The information on the Company s website is not part of this report. Recent Developments For a discussion of business developments that occurred in 2022, see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations later in this report. Certain summarized highlights are contained below. Investments and Disposition Activity During 2022, the Company completed approximately 1.62 billion of investments in net leased retail real estate, including acquisition and closing costs. Total investment volume includes the acquisition of 434 properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1.6 billion and the completed development of seven properties for an aggregate cost of approximately 22.5 million. These 441 properties are net leased to tenants operating in 27 sectors and are located in 43 states. These assets are 100 leased for a weighted average lease term of approximately 10.2 years.

 During 2022, the Company sold seven assets for net proceeds of 44.9 million. Leasing During 2022, excluding properties that were sold, the Company executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 850,000 square feet of GLA throughout its portfolio. The annualized base contractual rent associated with these new leases, extensions or options is approximately 8.6 million. Dividends The Company increased its monthly dividend per common share from 0.227 to 0.234 in April 2022 and further increased the monthly dividend per common share to 0.240 in October 2022. The December 2022 dividend per share of 0.240 represents an annualized dividend of 2.88 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.1 based on the last reported sales price of our common stock listed on the NYSE of 70.93 on December 30, 2022. The Company has routinely paid cash dividends to our common shareholders. Common cash dividends were paid quarterly for 107 consecutive quarters between 1994 and 2020 prior to moving to monthly common cash dividends in 2021. We have since paid 25 consecutive monthly dividends. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying regular dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of common dividends, that we will continue our recent pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period. In addition to its common dividends, the Company paid monthly cash dividends on its 4.25 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Financing Equity During 2022, the Company completed two follow-on public offerings totaling 11,500,000 shares of common stock under its shelf registration statement, in connection with forward sale agreements. Upon settlement, these offerings are anticipated to raise total net proceeds of 767.4 million after deducting fees and expenses and making certain other adjustments as provided in the equity distribution agreements. During 2022, the Company settled 7,350,000 shares of common stock under these forward sale agreements, realizing net proceeds of 492.9 million. In addition, the Company settled 5,750,000 shares of common stock under a forward settlement agreement related to a follow-on public offering from December 2021, realizing net proceeds of 368.7 million. In September 2022, the Company entered into a new 750 million at-the-market ATM program (the 2022 ATM Program through which the Company, from time to time, may sell shares of common stock and/or enter into forward sale agreements. During 2022, the Company settled 5,453,975 shares of common stock under predecessor ATM programs, generating net proceeds of 379.1 million. Additionally, the Company completed forward sale agreements under the 2022 ATM Program for 4,350,232 shares of common stock, for anticipated future net proceeds of 300.9 million. The Company has settled 245,591 shares of these forward sale agreements as of December 31, 2022 for net proceeds of approximately 18.1 million, after deducting fees and expenses. The Company is required to settle these forward agreements by various dates between November and December 2023. After considering the 4,350,232 shares of common stock subject to forward sale agreements under the 2022 ATM Program, the Company had approximately 446.6 million of availability remaining under the 2022 ATM Program as of December 31, 2022.

 Debt In April 2022, and in connection with a four-property acquisition, the Company assumed an interest only, mortgage note payable with a principal balance of 42.3 million, stated interest rate of 3.63 , and maturity in December 2029. In August 2022, the Operating Partnership completed an underwritten public offering of 300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.80 Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Senior Unsecured Public Notes ). The 2032 Senior Unsecured Public Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. Considering the effect of terminated swap agreements relating to these notes, the blended all-in rates for the 300 million principal amount is 3.96 . In November 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement which converted the interest rate on its 1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility from a spread over LIBOR to a spread over Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points. No other changes were made to the Revolving Credit Facility as a result of the amendment. Business Strategies Our primary business objectives are to capitalize on distinct market positioning in the retail net lease space, focus on 21st century industry-leading retailers through our external growth platforms, leverage our real estate acumen and relationships to identify superior risk-adjusted opportunities, maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure that enables growth, and provide consistent, high-quality earnings growth and a well-covered growing dividend. The following is a discussion of our investment, financing and asset management strategies. Investment We are primarily focused on the long-term, fee simple ownership of properties net leased to national or large, regional retailers operating in sectors we believe to be more e-commerce and recession resistant than other retail sectors. Our leases are typically long-term net leases that require the tenant to pay all property operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. We believe that a diversified portfolio of such properties provides for stable and predictable cash flow. We seek to expand and enhance our portfolio by identifying the best risk-adjusted investment opportunities across our three external growth platforms: development, Partner Capital Solutions PCS and acquisitions. Development: We have been developing retail properties since the formation of our predecessor company in 1971 and our development platform seeks to employ our capabilities to direct all aspects of the development process, including site selection, land acquisition, lease negotiation, due diligence, design and construction. Our developments are typically build-to-suit projects that result in fee simple ownership of the property upon completion. Partner Capital Solutions: We launched our PCS program in April 2012. Our PCS program allows us to acquire properties or development opportunities by partnering with private developers or retailers on their in-process developments. We offer construction expertise and access to capital to facilitate the successful completion of their projects. We typically take fee simple ownership of PCS projects upon completion. Acquisitions: Our acquisitions platform was launched in April 2010 in order to expand our investment capabilities by pursuing opportunities that meet both our real estate and return on investment criteria. We believe that development and PCS projects have the potential to generate superior risk-adjusted returns on investment in properties that are substantially similar to those we acquire.

 We focus on four core principles that underlie our investment criteria: Omni-channel critical (e-commerce resistance), focusing on leading operators that have matured in omni-channel structure or those in e-commerce resistant sectors; Recession resistance, emphasizing a balanced portfolio with exposure to counter-cyclical sectors and retailers with strong credit profiles; Avoidance of private equity sponsorship, emphasizing leading operators with strong balance sheets and minimizing exposure to the possibility of such sponsorship overleveraging their acquisitions and reducing retailers abilities to invest in their businesses; and Adherence to strong real estate fundamentals and fungible buildings, protecting against unforeseen changes to our investment philosophies. Each platform leverages the Company s real estate acumen to pursue investments in net lease retail real estate. Factors that we consider when evaluating an investment include but are not limited to: Overall market-specific characteristics, such as demographics, market rents, competition and retail synergy; Asset-specific characteristics, such as the age, size, location, zoning, use and environmental history, accessibility, physical condition, signage and visibility of the property; Tenant-specific characteristics, including but not limited to the financial profile, operating history, business plan, size, market positioning, geographic footprint, management team, industry and/or sector-specific trends and other characteristics specific to the tenant and parent thereof; Unit-level operating characteristics, including store sales performance and profitability, if available; Lease-specific terms, including term of the lease, rent to be paid by the tenant and other tenancy considerations; and Transaction considerations, such as purchase price, seller profile and other non-financial terms. 
 Financing We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides us with the flexibility to manage our business and pursue our growth strategies, while allowing us to service our debt requirements and generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We believe these objectives are best achieved by a capital structure that consists primarily of common equity and prudent amounts of preferred equity and debt financing. However, we may raise capital in any form and under terms that we deem acceptable and in the best interest of our stockholders. We have previously utilized common and preferred stock equity offerings, secured mortgage borrowings, unsecured bank borrowings, private placements and public offerings of senior unsecured notes and the sale of properties to meet our capital requirements. We continually evaluate our financing policies on an on-going basis in light of current economic conditions, access to various capital markets, relative costs of equity and debt securities, the market value of our properties and other factors. We occasionally sell common stock through forward sale agreements, enabling the Company to set the price of shares upon pricing the offering while delaying the issuance of shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s ratio of total debt to enterprise value, assuming the conversion of common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership Operating Partnership Common Units into shares of common stock, was approximately 23.0 , and its ratio of total debt to total gross assets (before accumulated depreciation) was approximately 27.9 . As of December 31, 2022, our total debt outstanding before deferred financing costs and original issue discount was 1.96 billion, including 50.4 million of secured mortgage debt that had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.94 and a weighted average maturity of 6.2 years, 1.81 billion of unsecured borrowings that had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.31 (including the effects of previously settled, forward interest rate swap agreements) and a weighted average

Table of Contents 
 maturity of 7.8 years, and 100.0 million of floating rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.14 . Certain financial agreements to which the Company is a party contain covenants that limit its ability to incur debt under certain circumstances; however, our organizational documents do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. As such, we may modify our borrowing policies at any time without stockholder approval. Asset Management We maintain a proactive leasing and capital improvement program that, combined with the quality and locations of our properties, has made our properties attractive to tenants. We intend to continue to hold our properties for long-term investment and, accordingly, place a strong emphasis on the quality of construction and an on-going program of regular and preventative maintenance. Our properties are designed and built to require minimal capital improvements other than renovations or alterations, typically paid for by tenants. Personnel from our corporate headquarters conduct regular inspections of each property, maintain regular contact with major tenants and engage in consistent dialogue to understand store performance and tenant sustainability. We have a management information system designed to provide our management with the operating data necessary to make informed business decisions on a timely basis. This system provides us rapid access to lease data, tenants sales history, cash flow budgets and forecasts. Such a system helps us to maximize cash flow from operations and closely monitor corporate expenses. Competition The U.S. commercial real estate investment market is a highly competitive industry. We actively compete with many entities engaged in the acquisition, development and operation of commercial properties. As such, we compete with other investors for a limited supply of properties and financing for these properties. Investors include traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity firms, institutional investment funds, insurance companies and private individuals, many of which have greater financial resources than we do and the ability to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in our acquisition, development and leasing activities in the future. Significant Tenants No tenant accounted for more than 10.0 of our annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022. See Item 2 Properties for additional information on our top tenants and the composition of our tenant base. Regulation Environmental Investments in real property create the potential for environmental liability on the part of the owner or operator of such real property. If hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from a property, the owner or operator of the property may under certain statutory schemes be held strictly liable for all costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances. We have obtained a Phase I environmental study (which involves inspection without soil sampling or ground water analysis) conducted by independent environmental consultants on each of our properties and, in certain instances, have conducted additional investigation, including Phase II environmental assessments. We have no knowledge of any hazardous substances existing on our properties in violation of any applicable laws; however, no assurance can be given that such substances are not currently located on any of our properties. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, we have not received notice from any governmental authority of any noncompliance, liability or other claim in connection with any of our properties.

 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Our properties, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively, the ADA ). Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with the ADA. Our tenants will typically have primary responsibility for complying with the ADA, but we may incur costs if the tenant does not comply. As of December 31, 2022, we have not received notice from any governmental authority, nor are we otherwise aware, of any non-compliance with the ADA that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Human Capital Team Members and Values As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 76 full-time team members covering acquisitions, development, legal, asset management, accounting, finance, administrative, and executive functions as compared to 57 full-time team members as of December 31, 2021. The increased headcount is attributable to the Company s need to support its current and future portfolio growth. Our core values are the foundation of our Company culture and include: We are a team. We all roll up our sleeves and dig in, no matter the task. We achieve results by making consistent, disciplined decisions. We have a resilient mindset to achieve and exceed our goals. We push ourselves to be the best we can at our position and embrace the opportunities that new challenges present. We work to attract the best talent externally to meet the current and future demands of our business. We utilize social media, professional recruiters and other organizations to find motivated and talented team members and employ competency-based behavioral interviewing techniques. Talent Management Professional development is a cornerstone of our talent management system, and we diligently work to develop talent from within. We emphasize professional development through both technical and soft-skill development and training. To empower team members to reach their potential, the Company provides a range of on-the-job training and mentoring, knowledge sharing, continuing education and lunch-and-learn programs. Our talent management practices include the utilization of our core competency frameworks, professional development plans, career pathing and succession planning and carefully designed promotion and internal mobility opportunities. Our team members goal setting and performance feedback processes include formal quarterly and annual reviews and self and team leader reviews, as well as ongoing one-on-one meetings with team leaders. Professional development plans based on critical competencies are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along established timelines. Financial and Health Wellness As part of our compensation philosophy, we offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for team members in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include wages and incentives, but also health, welfare, and retirement benefits. Our compensation philosophies include: Total compensation that is both fair and competitive. The Company seeks fairness in total compensation with reference to external and internal comparisons. Attract, retain and motivate team members. Compensation is used to achieve business objectives by attracting, retaining and motivating top talent.

The Agree Wellness Program affords team members paid time off and holidays, fully equipped on-site fitness amenities, and leaves of absence for specified events. Insurance coverages are provided for all team members and their dependents, including medical, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance. The Company pays 100 of medical, short-term, long-term, and life insurance premiums for team members and their families. COVID-19 During 2022, we have continued to focus on the safety of our team members in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so we have: When warranted, closed our offices for non-essential functions and offered remote work flexibility; Provided personal protective equipment and maintained cleaning protocols; Maintained regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures; Continued screening of any team members and vendors at our offices; Maintained protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure; and Continued employing protocols regarding required masks and social distancing Environmental, Social and Governance ESG As part of the Company s commitment to continuously improving our understanding of and performance across material ESG topics, the Company engaged a third-party consultant in 2022 to help identify opportunities for improvement across our programs, policies, and disclosures to meet the expectations of our stakeholders. This process resulted in a three-year action plan and roadmap for the Company to enhance its ESG program through oversight structures, risk management, policies, data collection, reporting, and stakeholder engagement. Environmental Sustainability The Company, through its team members, understands that corporate and environmental responsibility is an ongoing endeavor and embraces responsibility to being a steward of the environment, using natural resources carefully, and meeting the goals of its tenant partners. We remain committed to using our time, talents, resources and relationships to grow in a manner that makes the world and the environment better for future generations. The Company s focus on industry leading, national and super-regional retailers provides for long-term relationships with some of the most environmentally conscientious retailers in the world. This is particularly meaningful because the Company s portfolio is primarily comprised of properties that are leased to tenants under long-term net leases where the tenant is generally responsible for maintaining the property and implementing environmentally responsible practices. We are proud to know that our tenants have pioneered the use of environmentally-preferable solutions in their business practices in many ways. In 2022, the Company enhanced its engagement with its retail partners on shared sustainability initiatives, introduced green lease language into its standard lease forms, and executed leases that contained green clauses with several tenants. Additionally, the Company s award-winning headquarters utilize green technologies including programmable thermostats, Low-E window glass, LEED HVAC systems and LED occupancy-sensored lighting.

Team members are compensated for their performance and rewarded for their outstanding work. Alignment of individual, team, corporate and stockholder objectives provides for continuity, teamwork and increased collaboration. Our team members are paid commensurate with their qualifications, responsibilities, productivity, quality of work and adherence to our core values. The Agree Culture Committee is composed of team members from departments throughout the organization. The Company s Culture Committee hosts a variety of events that are focused on team building and camaraderie as well as contributing to the communities in which they live. Governance Fiduciary Duties and Ethics We believe that nothing is more important than a company s reputation for integrity and serving as a responsible fiduciary for its stockholders. We are committed to managing the Company for the benefit of our stockholders and are focused on maintaining good corporate governance. Our Board has nine directors, seven of whom are independent. Five new independent directors have been added since 2018. Independent directors meet regularly, without the presence of officers or team members. A Lead Independent Director was appointed in 2019. The Board has adopted an insider trading policy that applies to all directors, officers and team members. The Company does not have a stockholder rights plan poison pill and maintains stock ownership guidelines for directors and named executive officers requiring specified levels of stock ownership. Time-vested stock grants to officers and team members vest over a five-year period to provide long-term alignment, while performance-based stock grants to named executive officers utilize total shareholder return, with the amount of the grants intended to increase as total returns to stockholders increase, further enhancing alignment. Our board of directors has established a succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer to cover emergencies and other occurrences. Finally, the Company annually submits say-on-pay advisory votes to its stockholders. Available Information We make available free of charge through our website at www.agreerealty.com all reports we electronically file with, or furnish to, the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These filings are also accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Item 1A: Risk Factors The following factors and other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere in future SEC reports. You should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this report, as well as any reports, amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the

 aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations Economic and financial conditions may have a negative effect on our business and operations. Changes in global or national economic conditions, such as a market downturn or a disruption in the capital markets, may cause, among other things, a significant tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rate of default and bankruptcy and lower consumer spending and business spending, which could adversely affect our business and operations. Potential consequences of changes in economic and financial conditions include: Changes in the performance of our tenants, which may result in lower rent and lower recoverable expenses that the tenant can afford to pay and tenant defaults under the leases; Current or potential tenants may delay or postpone entering into long-term net leases with us; The ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable may be limited or unavailable, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from acquisition and development activities, reduce our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders and increase our future interest expense; Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions; The recognition of impairment charges on or reduced values of our properties, which may adversely affect our results of operations or limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices and may reduce the availability of buyer financing; and One or more lenders under our revolving credit facility could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all. We are also limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn given certain fixed costs and commitments associated with our operations, which could materially impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. Our business is significantly dependent on single tenant properties. We focus our development and investment activities on ownership of real properties that are primarily net leased to a single tenant. Therefore, the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, a single tenant under its lease and the potential resulting vacancy is likely to cause a significant reduction in our operating cash flows from that property and a significant reduction in the value of the property and could cause a significant impairment loss. In addition, we would be responsible for all of the operating costs of a property following a vacancy at a single tenant building. Because our properties have generally been built to suit a particular tenant s specific needs and desires, we may also incur significant losses to make the leased premises ready for another tenant and experience difficulty or a significant delay in releasing such property. Bankruptcy laws will limit our remedies if a tenant becomes bankrupt and rejects its leases. If a tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent, that could diminish the income we receive from that tenant s leases. We may not be able to evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leasehold with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be an unsecured claim subject to statutory limitations, and therefore any amounts received in bankruptcy are likely to be substantially less valuable than the remaining rent we otherwise were owed under the leases. In addition, any payment on a claim we have for unpaid past rent could be substantially less than the amount owed.

 Our portfolio is concentrated in certain states, which makes us more susceptible to adverse events in these areas. Our properties are located in 48 states throughout the United States and in particular, the state of Texas (where 124 properties out of 1,839 properties are located, or 7.3 of our annualized base rent was derived as of December 31, 2022), Ohio (122 properties, or 5.7 of our annualized base rent) Florida (116 properties, or 5.6 of our annualized base rent), Michigan (101 properties, or 5.6 of our annualized base rent), and Illinois (106 properties, or 5.5 of our annualized rent). An economic downturn or other adverse events or conditions such as natural disasters in any of these areas, or any other area where we may have significant concentration in the future, could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to our company. Our tenants are concentrated in certain retail sectors, which makes us susceptible to adverse conditions impacting these sectors. As of December 31, 2022, 9.1 , 8.9 and 8.9 of our annualized contractual base rent and interest were derived from tenants operating in the home improvement, grocery store, and tire and auto service sectors, respectively. Similarly, we have concentrations in other sectors such as dollar stores, convenience stores, and general merchandise. Any decrease in consumer demand for the products and services offered by our tenants operating in any industries for which we have concentrations could have an adverse effect on our tenants revenues, costs and results of operations, thereby adversely affecting their ability to meet their lease obligations to us. As we continue to invest in properties, our portfolio may become more or less concentrated by industry sector. There are risks associated with our development and acquisition activities. We intend to continue the development of new properties and to consider possible acquisitions of existing properties. We anticipate that our new developments will be financed under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing that will result in a risk that permanent fixed rate financing on newly developed projects might not be available or would be available only on disadvantageous terms. In addition, new project development is subject to a number of risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase anticipated project costs. Furthermore, new project commencement risks also include receipt of zoning, occupancy, other required governmental permits and authorizations and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. If permanent debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms to finance new development or acquisitions undertaken without permanent financing, further development activities or acquisitions might be curtailed, or cash available for distribution might be adversely affected. Acquisitions entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment. Loss of revenues from tenants would reduce the Company s cash flow. Our tenants encounter significant macroeconomic, governmental and competitive forces. Adverse changes in consumer spending or consumer preferences for particular goods, services or store-based retailing could severely impact their ability to pay rent. Shifts from in-store to online shopping could increase due to changing consumer shopping patterns as well as the increase in consumer adoption and use of mobile electronic devices. This expansion of e-commerce could have an adverse impact on our tenant s ongoing viability. The default, financial distress, bankruptcy or liquidation of one or more of our tenants could cause substantial vacancies in our property portfolio or impact our tenants ability to pay rent. Vacancies reduce our revenues, increase property expenses and could decrease the value of each vacant property. Upon the expiration of a lease, the tenant may choose not to renew the lease, renegotiate the economics of any option period(s) as a condition of exercising one or more of them, and/or we may not be able to release the vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such renewal or re-leasing. These risks could be exacerbated by a deterioration in the financial condition of any major tenant with leases in multiple locations. The availability and timing of cash dividends is uncertain. We expect to continue to pay regular dividends to our stockholders. However, we bear all expenses incurred by our operations, and our funds generated by operations, after deducting these expenses, may not be sufficient to cover desired 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 levels of dividends to our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that sufficient funds will be available to pay dividends. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions, or other limitations under our indebtedness, annual dividend requirements or the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Further, we may issue new shares of common stock as compensation to our team members or in connection with public offerings or acquisitions. Any future issuances may substantially increase the cash required to pay dividends at current or higher levels. Any preferred shares we may offer may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common stock. Conversely, payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer. If we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common stock, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares. We face risks relating to information technology and cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes and we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide infrastructure and security for processing, transmitting and storing information. Any failure, inadequacy or interruption could materially harm our business. Furthermore, our business is subject to risks from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. Cybersecurity incidents could cause operational interruption, damage to our business relationships, private data exposure (including personally identifiable information, or proprietary and confidential information, of ours and our team members, as well as third parties) and affect the efficiency of our business operations. Any such incidents could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information and reduce the benefits of our technologies. Further, while we carry cyber liability insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses related to such events. Our environmental, social and governance commitments could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance. From time to time we communicate our strategies, commitments and targets related to sustainability and other environmental, social and governance matters. These strategies, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, and we may be unable to achieve them. We may from time to time incur additional expense to meet such targets. Any failure to meet these sustainability targets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to our strategies, commitments and targets, or our ability to achieve them. Any scrutiny of our sustainability disclosures or our failure to achieve related strategies, commitments and targets could negatively impact our reputation or performance.

 General Real Estate Risk Our performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets. There are risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. Although many of our leases contain terms that obligate the tenants to bear substantially all of the costs of operating our properties, investing in real estate involves a number of risks. Income from and the value of our properties may be adversely affected by: Changes in general or local economic conditions; The attractiveness of our properties to potential tenants; Changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area; Bankruptcies, financial difficulties or lease defaults by our tenants; Changes in operating costs and expense and our ability to control rents; Our ability to lease properties at favorable rental rates; Our ability to sell a property when we desire to do so at a favorable price; Property damage or casualty loss; Impacts of climate change; The potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time; Changes in or increased costs of compliance with governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including changes in the ADA and similar regulations and tax, real estate, environmental and zoning laws, and our potential liability thereunder. Economic and financial market conditions have and may continue to exacerbate many of the foregoing risks. If a tenant fails to perform on its lease covenants, that would not excuse us from meeting any mortgage debt obligation secured by the property and could require us to fund reserves in favor of our mortgage lenders, thereby reducing funds available for payment of cash dividends on our shares of common stock. The fact that real estate investments are relatively illiquid may reduce economic returns to investors. We may desire to sell a property in the future because of changes in market conditions or poor tenant performance or to avail ourselves of other opportunities. We may also be required to sell a property in the future to meet secured debt obligations or to avoid a secured debt loan default. Real estate properties cannot generally be sold quickly, and we cannot assure you that we could always obtain a favorable price. We may be required to invest in the restoration or modification of a property before we can sell it, or we may need to obtain landlord consent to sell certain assets in which we have a leasehold interest in the land underlying the buildings. This lack of liquidity may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire significantly affects our business. We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration of leases for space located in our properties, the premises may not be re-let or the terms of re-letting (including the cost of concessions to tenants) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If a tenant does not renew its lease or if a tenant defaults on its lease obligations, there is no assurance we could obtain a substitute tenant on acceptable terms. If we cannot obtain another tenant with comparable building structural space and configuration needs, we may be required to modify the property for a different use, which may involve a significant capital expenditure and a delay in re-leasing the property. Further, if we are unable to re-let promptly all or a substantial portion of our retail space or if the rental rates upon such re-letting were significantly lower than expected rates, our net income and ability to make expected distributions to stockholders would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants in any of our properties upon the expiration of their leases.

 Our leases contain certain limitations on tenants real estate tax, insurance and operating cost reimbursement obligations. Our tenants under net leases generally are responsible for paying the real estate taxes, insurance costs and operating costs associated with the leased property. However, certain leases contain limitations on the tenant s cost reimbursement obligations and, therefore, there are costs which may be incurred and which will not be reimbursed in full by tenants. This could reduce our operating cash flows from those properties and could reduce the value of those properties. Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be required to investigate and clean up any release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties, regardless of our knowledge or actual responsibility, simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. This potential liability results from the following: As owner, we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; The law may impose clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; Even if more than one person is responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and Governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs. 
 These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property. The presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or lease an affected property. In addition, some environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination. We own and may in the future acquire properties that will be operated as convenience stores with gas station facilities. The operation of convenience stores with gas station facilities at our properties will create additional environmental concerns. Similarly, we may lease properties to users or producers of other hazardous materials. We require that the tenants who operate these facilities do so in material compliance with current laws and regulations. A majority of our leases require our tenants to comply with environmental laws and to indemnify us against environmental liability arising from the operation of the properties. However, we could be subject to strict liability under environmental laws because we own the properties. There are certain losses, including losses from environmental liabilities, that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. There is also a risk that tenants may not satisfy their environmental compliance and indemnification obligations under the leases. Any of these events could substantially increase our cost of operations, require us to fund environmental indemnities in favor of our secured lenders and reduce our ability to service our secured debt and pay dividends to stockholders and any debt security interest payments. Environmental problems at any properties could also put us in default under loans secured by those properties, as well as loans secured by unaffected properties. Uninsured losses relating to real property may adversely affect our returns. Our leases generally require tenants to carry comprehensive liability and extended coverage insurance on our properties. However, there are certain losses, including losses from environmental liabilities, terrorist acts or catastrophic acts of nature, that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If there is an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insurance limits, we could lose both the revenues generated by the affected property and the capital we have invested in the property. In the event of a substantial unreimbursed loss, we would remain obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property.

 Risks Related to Our Debt Financings Our level of indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial position, including reducing funds available for other business purposes and reducing our operational flexibility, and we may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms. At December 31, 2022, our ratio of total debt to enterprise value (assuming conversion of Operating Partnership Common Units into shares of common stock) was approximately 23.0 . Incurring substantial debt may adversely affect our business and operating results by: Requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal, which reduces the amount available for distributions, acquisitions and capital expenditures; Making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions; Requiring us to agree to less favorable terms, including higher interest rates, in order to incur additional debt, and otherwise limiting our ability to borrow for operations, working capital or to finance acquisitions in the future; or Limiting our flexibility in conducting our business, including our ability to finance or refinance our assets, contribute assets to joint ventures or sell assets as needed, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms. 
 In addition, the use of leverage presents an additional element of risk in the event that (1) the cash flow from lease payments on our properties is insufficient to meet debt obligations, (2) we are unable to refinance our debt obligations as necessary or on as favorable terms, (3) there is an increase in interest rates, (4) we default on our financial obligations or (5) debt service requirements increase. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the property could be foreclosed upon with a consequential loss of income and asset value to us. We generally intend to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness (including construction or acquisition financing) to total market capitalization of 65 or less. Nevertheless, we may operate with debt levels which are in excess of 65 of total market capitalization for extended periods of time. If our debt capitalization policy were changed, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our operating cash flow and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders, and could result in an increased risk of default on our obligations. Covenants in our credit agreements and note purchase agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of the financing agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. Our financing agreements contain certain cross-default provisions which could be triggered in the event that we default on our other indebtedness. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the revolving credit facility in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default. If our properties were foreclosed upon, or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flows and our financial condition would be adversely affected. Our unsecured revolving credit facility, certain term loan agreements and certain note purchase agreements contain various restrictive corporate covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, our unsecured revolving credit facility, certain term loan agreements and certain note purchase agreements have unencumbered pool covenants, which include a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio and a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. Furthermore, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us.

 An increase in market interest rates could raise our interest costs on existing and future debt or adversely affect our stock price, and a decrease in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate or adversely affect our results of operations. Our interest costs for any new debt and our current debt obligations may rise if interest rates increase. This increased cost could make the financing of any new acquisition more expensive as well as lower our current period earnings. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access third parties have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay to lease our assets and limit our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. An increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates and could reduce the overall returns on your investment. We use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. These instruments involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable, and that we may have to post collateral to enter into hedging transactions, which we may lose if we are unable to honor our obligations. These instruments may also generate income that may not be treated as qualifying REIT income for purposes of the REIT income tests. In addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of our hedging strategies. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. Moreover, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses that may reduce the overall return on your investment. Future offerings of debt and equity may not be available to us or may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We expect to continue to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities in the future, which could include classes or series of preferred stock, common stock and senior or subordinated notes. Our ability to raise additional capital may be restricted at a time when we would like or need, including as a result of market conditions. Future market dislocations could cause us to seek sources of potentially less attractive capital and impact our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. All debt securities and other borrowings, as well as all classes or series of preferred stock, will be senior to our common stock in a liquidation of our company. Additional equity offerings could dilute our stockholders equity and reduce the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of an additional offering of our common stock and the value of our properties, our stockholders may experience dilution in both the book value and fair value of their shares. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur, and this could materially and adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities . In addition, we may issue preferred stock or other securities convertible into equity securities with a distribution preference or a liquidation preference that may limit our ability to make distributions on our common stock. Our ability to estimate the amount, timing or nature of additional offerings is limited as these factors will depend upon market conditions and other factors.

 Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure Our charter, bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. Our charter contains 9.8 ownership limits. Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT and contains provisions that limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 9.8 (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock and no more than 9.8 (in value) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, any person from the ownership limits. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limits may delay or impede, and we may use the ownership limits deliberately to delay or impede, a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. We have a staggered board. Our directors are divided into three classes serving three-year staggered terms. The staggering of our board of directors may discourage offers for the Company or make an acquisition more difficult, even when an acquisition may be viewed to be in the best interest of our stockholders. We could issue stock without stockholder approval. Our board of directors could, without stockholder approval, issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock. In addition, our board of directors could, without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of such classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could establish a series of stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be viewed to be in the best interest of our stockholders. Provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company. Certain provisions of Maryland law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under certain circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares, including: Business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter would require the recommendation of our board of directors and impose special appraisal rights and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and Control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. 
 The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.

Additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL, permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or our bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price. Our charter, our bylaws, the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be viewed to be in the best interest of our stockholders. An officer and director may have interests that conflict with the interests of stockholders. An officer and member of our board of directors owns Operating Partnership Units. This individual may have personal interests that conflict with the interests of our stockholders with respect to business decisions affecting us and the Operating Partnership, such as interests in the timing and pricing of property sales or refinancing in order to obtain favorable tax treatment. Federal Income Tax Risks Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy numerous income, asset and other tests, thus having to forego investments we might otherwise make and hindering our investment performance. Failure to qualify as a REIT could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions. We will be subject to increased taxation if we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Although we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, no assurance can be given that we will remain so qualified. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and applicable treasury regulations is also increased in the context of a REIT that holds its assets in partnership form. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. Additionally, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the approval of our stockholders. A REIT that annually distributes at least 90 of its taxable income to its stockholders generally is not taxed at the corporate level on such distributed income. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS that we qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will face tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of cash dividends: We would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. We may be subject to increased state and local taxes. Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be treated as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify. 
 In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required to pay dividends (other than any mandatory dividends on any preferred shares we may offer). As a result of these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.

 U.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which we operate, our stock and our results of operations, both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to anticipate. Changes to the federal income tax laws are proposed regularly. Additionally, the REIT rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. If enacted, certain such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. In particular, H.R. 1, which took effect for taxable years that began on or after January 1, 2018 (subject to certain exceptions), as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act made many significant changes to the federal income tax laws that profoundly impacted the taxation of individuals, corporations (both regular C corporations as well as corporations that have elected to be taxed as REITs), and the taxation of taxpayers with overseas assets and operations. A number of changes that affect non-corporate taxpayers will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts to extend them. These changes impact us and our stockholders in various ways, some of which are adverse or potentially adverse compared to prior law. While the IRS has issued some guidance with respect to certain of the new provisions, there are numerous interpretive issues that will require further guidance, and technical corrections legislation may be needed to clarify certain aspects of the new law and give proper effect to Congressional intent. There can be no assurance, however, that technical clarifications or further changes needed to prevent unintended or unforeseen tax consequences will be enacted by Congress. In addition, while certain elements of tax reform legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact the geographic markets in which we operate, the tenants that populate our properties and the customers who frequent our properties in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to anticipate. Other legislative proposals could be enacted in the future that could affect REITs and their stockholders. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of these tax law changes and any other potential tax law changes on an investment in our common stock. Changes in tax laws may prevent us from maintaining our qualification as a REIT. As we have previously described, we intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. However, this intended qualification is based on the tax laws that are currently in effect. We are unable to predict any future changes in the tax laws that would adversely affect our status as a REIT. If there is a change in the tax law that prevents us from qualifying as a REIT or that requires REITs generally to pay corporate level income taxes, we may not be able to make the same level of distributions to our stockholders. Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. In order to qualify as a REIT, at least 75 of the value of our assets must consist of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investments in securities (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) cannot include more than 10 of the voting securities or 10 of the value of all securities, of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the total value of our assets (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) can consist of securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20 of the total value of our assets can be represented by one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. We may have to borrow funds or sell assets to meet our distribution requirements. Subject to some adjustments that are unique to REITs, a REIT generally must distribute 90 of its taxable income. For the purpose of determining taxable income, we may be required to accrue interest, rent and other items treated as earned for tax purposes but that we have not yet received. In addition, we may be required not to accrue as expenses for tax purposes some expenses that actually have been paid, including, for example, payments of principal on our debt, or some of our deductions might be disallowed by the IRS. As a result, we could have taxable income in excess of cash available for distribution. If this occurs, we may have to borrow funds or liquidate some of our assets in order to meet the distribution requirement applicable to a REIT.

 Our ownership of and relationship with our TRSs will be limited, and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our REIT status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax. A REIT may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Overall, no more than 20 of the value of a REIT s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. A TRS will typically pay federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. In addition, the TRS rules impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. Our TRSs will pay federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but will not be required to be distributed to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 20 limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above. Liquidation of our assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification. To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any gain if we sell assets in transactions that are considered to be prohibited transactions, which are explained in the risk factor below. We may be subject to other tax liabilities even if we qualify as a REIT. Even if we remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, we will be subject to federal income tax on any of our REIT taxable income (including capital gains) that we do not distribute annually to our stockholders. Additionally, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. Moreover, if we have net income from prohibited transactions, that income will be subject to a 100 tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale. While we will undertake sales of assets if those assets become inconsistent with our long-term strategic or return objectives, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise. The need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that might otherwise be in our best interest to sell. In addition, any net taxable income earned directly by our TRSs, or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our TRSs, will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax. To the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal, state and local taxes, we will have less cash available for distributions to our stockholders. Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates on dividend income from regular corporations. The maximum federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable by non-REIT corporations to certain non-corporate U.S. stockholders is generally 20 and a 3.8 Medicare tax may also apply. Dividends paid by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Commencing with taxable years that began on or after January 1, 2018 and continuing through 2025, H.R. 1 temporarily reduced the effective tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends (i.e., dividends other than capital gain dividends and dividends attributable to certain qualified dividend income received by us) for U.S. holders of our common stock that are individuals, estates or trusts by permitting such holders to claim a deduction in determining their taxable income equal to 20 of any such dividends they receive. Taking into account H.R. 1 s reduction in the maximum individual federal income tax rate from 39.6 to 37 , this results in a maximum effective rate of regular income tax on ordinary REIT dividends of 29.6 through 2025 (as compared to the 20 maximum federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income received from a non-REIT corporation). The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT

 corporations that pay distributions. This could materially and adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets that is clearly identified in the manner specified in the Internal Revenue Code does not constitute gross income, and is not counted for purposes of income tests that apply to us as a REIT. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRSs will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRSs. General Risks Loss of our key personnel could materially impair our ability to operate successfully. Our continued success and our ability to manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of key personnel. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities and our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and industry personnel, which could materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report financial results, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Disclosure controls and procedures are processes designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is communicated to management and reported in a timely manner. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in continuing to maintain adequate control over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities. In addition, as our business continues to grow, and as we continue to make significant acquisitions, our internal controls will become more complex and may require significantly more resources to ensure that our disclosure controls and procedures remain effective. Moreover, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls and procedures may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our reputation and operating results could be materially adversely affected, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could result in a reduction in the trading price of our common stock. The market price and trading volume of shares of our common stock may fluctuate or decline. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including: Broad market fluctuations; Market reaction to any additional indebtedness we incur or debt or equity securities we or the Operating Partnership issue in the future; Additions or departures of key management personnel;

 Changes in our credit ratings; The financial condition, performance and prospects of our tenants; Changes in market interest rates; and The realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. Those factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. It is impossible to provide any assurance that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future, and it may be difficult for holders to resell shares of our common stock at prices they find attractive, or at all. The COVID-19 pandemic, its variants, and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. The COVID-19 pandemic, including continued spread of new variants, has had, and other pandemics in the future could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, could also have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, among other factors: A complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government or tenant action; Reduced economic activity could severely impact our tenants businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; Reduced economic activity could result in a prolonged recession, which could negatively impact consumer discretionary spending; Difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, potential impacts to our credit ratings, and a prolonged severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis and our tenants ability to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us; Negative impacts to our future compliance with financial covenants of our Revolving Credit Facility and other debt agreements could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and pay dividends; Any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; A decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; A deteriorati on in our or our tenants ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants; and The potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during this disruption. 
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, impacts our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impacts on our business. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic, of a future pandemic, presents a material uncertainty and risk with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.

 Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments There are no unresolved staff comments. Item 2: Properties As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of 1,839 properties located in 48 states and totaling approximately 38.1 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio was approximately 99.7 leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 8.8 years. A significant majority of our properties are leased to national tenants and approximately 67.8 of our annualized base rent was derived from tenants, or parents thereof, with an investment grade credit rating. Substantially all of our tenants are subject to net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on fixed amounts or increases in the consumer price index and certain leases provide for additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a specified level.

Item 4: Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5: Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information and Dividend Policy Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol ADC. At February 13, 2023, there were 90,173,424 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding which were held by approximately 139 stockholders of record. The number of stockholders of record does not reflect persons or entities that held their shares in nominee or street name. In addition, at February 13, 2023 there were 347,619 outstanding Operating Partnership Common Units held by a limited partner other than our Company. The Operating Partnership Common Units are exchangeable into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. We intend to continue to declare regular dividends. However, our distributions are determined by our board of directors and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. We have historically paid cash dividends, although we may choose to pay a portion in stock dividends in the future. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains to our stockholders, as well as meet certain other requirements. We must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized; or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date during such period and paid during January of the following year. Such distributions are treated for REIT tax purposes as paid by us and received by our stockholders on December 31 of the year in which they are declared. In addition, at our election, a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. These distributions qualify as dividends paid for the 90 REIT distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid.

Item 6: [Reserved] Item 7: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1A Risk Factors above. Also refer to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional discussion of our financial condition and results of operations, including a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Overview The Company is a fully integrated REIT primarily focused on the ownership, acquisition, development and management of retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants. The Company was founded in 1971 by its current Executive Chairman, Richard Agree, and its common stock was listed on the NYSE in 1994. The Company s assets are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, directly or indirectly, the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the sole general partner and in which the Company held a 99.6 common interest as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 1-Organization in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the ownership structure. Under the agreement of limited partnership of the Operating Partnership, the Company, as the sole general partner, has exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s portfolio consisted of 1,839 properties located in 48 states and totaling approximately 38.1 million square feet of GLA. The Company s portfolio was approximately 99.7 leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 8.8 years. A significant majority of the Company s properties are leased to national tenants and approximately 67.8 of our annualized base rent was derived from tenants, or parent entities thereof, with an investment grade credit rating from S P Global Ratings, Moody s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1994. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. Results of Operations Overall The Company s real estate investment portfolio grew from approximately 4.37 billion in net investment amount representing 1,404 properties with 29.1 million square feet of gross leasable space as of December 31, 2021 to

Table of Contents 
 approximately 5.74 billion in net investment amount representing 1,839 properties with 38.1 million square feet of gross leasable space at December 31, 2022. The Company s real estate investments were made throughout the periods presented and were not all outstanding for the entire period; accordingly, a portion of the increase in rental income between periods is related to recognizing revenue in 2022 on acquisitions that were made during 2021. Similarly, the full rental income impact of acquisitions made during 2022 will not be seen until 2023. Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired 434 retail net lease assets for approximately 1.6 billion, which includes acquisition and closing costs. These properties are located in 43 states and are leased to tenants operating in 27 diverse retail sectors for a weighted average lease term of approximately 10.2 years. The underwritten weighted-average capitalization rate on the acquisitions was 6.2 . 1 Dispositions During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold seven assets for net proceeds of 44.9 million. The weighted-average capitalization rate on the dispositions was 6.5 . 1 Development and Partner Capital Solutions During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company commenced 28 development or PCS projects. At December 31, 2022 the Company had 24 development or Partner Capital Solutions projects under construction. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2022 to Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Year Ended Variance December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in dollars) (percentage) Rental Income 429,632 339,067 90,565 27 Real Estate Tax Expense 32,079 25,513 6,566 26 Property Operating Expense 18,585 13,996 4,589 33 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 133,570 95,729 37,841 40 The variances in rental income, real estate tax expense, property operating expense and depreciation and amortization expense shown above were due to the acquisition and the ownership of an increased number of properties during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 , as further described under Results of Operations - Overall above . General and administrative expenses increased 4.6 million, or 18 , to 30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of increased employee headcount and increased compensation costs. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 7.0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 7.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision for impairment decreased to 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provisions for impairment are recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through operations plus estimated disposition proceeds and are not necessarily comparable period-to-period. Interest expense increased 13.0 million, or 26 , to 63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 50.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of higher levels of borrowings in 2022 in comparison to 2021, as well as higher interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 1 When used within this discussion, weighted average capitalization rate for acquisitions and dispositions is defined by the Company as the sum of contractual fixed annual rents computed on a straight-line basis over the primary lease terms and anticipated annual net tenant recoveries, divided by the purchase and sale prices for occupied properties.

 Borrowings increased in order to finance the acquisition and development of additional properties (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt below). Gain on sale of assets decreased to 5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gains on sales of assets are dependent on the levels of disposition activity and the assets basis relative to their sales prices. As a result, such gains are not necessarily comparable period-to-period. Income tax expense increased 0.5 million, or 19 , to 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in income tax expense was due to the acquisitions and the ownership of an increased number of properties during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, partially offset by additional tax expense of approximately 0.5 million recognized during 2021 relating to the true-up of expense upon filing of the 2020 annual tax returns. In May 2021, the Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2028 Senior Unsecured Public Notes and the 2033 Senior Unsecured Public Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under its unsecured term loans and settle the related swap agreements. The Company incurred a charge of 14.6 million upon this repayment and settlement, including swap termination costs of 13.4 million and the write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs of 1.2 million. Net income increased 30.1 million, or 25 , to 153.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the growth of our portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2022, and the repayment and settlement charge in 2021 discussed above. After allocation of income to non-controlling interest and preferred stockholders, net income attributable to common stockholders increased 24.9 million, or 21 to 145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 120.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The allocation of income to the preferred stockholders began upon the September 2021 issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s principal demands for funds include payment of operating expenses, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, dividends and distributions to its stockholders and holders of the units of the Operating Partnership (the Operating Partnership Common Units ), and future property acquisitions and development. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through cash provided from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, available cash and cash equivalents, including cash held in escrow, was 28.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 100.0 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility and 900.0 million was available for future borrowings, subject to its compliance with covenants. The Company anticipates funding its long-term capital needs through cash provided from operations, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, the issuance of debt and common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity. We continually evaluate alternative financing and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs, is uncertain and cannot be predicted and could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Capitalization As of December 31, 2022, the Company s total enterprise value was approximately 8.53 billion. Total enterprise value consisted of 6.42 billion of common equity (based on the December 31, 2022 closing price of Company common stock on the NYSE of 70.93 per share and assuming the conversion of Operating Partnership Common Units), 175 million of preferred equity (stated at liquidation value), and 1.96 billion of total debt including (i) 100.0 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility; (ii) 1.81 billion of senior unsecured notes; (iii) 50.4 million of mortgage notes payable;

 less 28.9 million cash, cash equivalents, and cash held in escrow. The Company s ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 23.0 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership consisted of a 0.4 common ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership Common Units may, under certain circumstances, be exchanged for shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Company, as sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, has the option to settle exchanged Operating Partnership Common Units held by others for cash based on the current trading price of our shares. Assuming the exchange of all Operating Partnership Common Units, there would have been 90,521,043 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022. Equity Shelf Registration The Company has filed with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, registering an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and guarantees of debt securities of the Operating Partnership, as well as an unspecified amount of debt securities of the Operating Partnership, at an indeterminate aggregate initial offering price. The Company may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. Common Stock Offerings In May 2022, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase 750,000 shares in connection with forward sale agreements.

During 2022, the Company settled 1,600,000 shares of common stock under the forward sale agreements, realizing net proceeds of 106.2 million. Preferred Stock Offering As of December 31, 2022, we had 7,000,000 depositary shares (the Depositary Shares outstanding, each representing 1/1,000th of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares are payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month (or, if not on a business day, on the next succeeding business day).

The Revolving Credit Facility will mature in January 2026 with Company options to extend the maturity date to January 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility s interest rate is based on a pricing grid with a range of 72.5 to 140 basis points over SOFR, determined by the Company s credit ratings and leverage ratio, plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points. The margins for the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to improvement based on the Company s leverage ratio, provided its credit ratings meet a certain threshold. Based on the Company s credit ratings and leverage ratio at the time of closing, pricing on the Revolving Credit Facility was 87.5 basis points over SOFR. In connection with the Company s ongoing environmental, social and governance ESG initiatives, pricing may be reduced if specific ESG ratings are achieved.

The Company was in compliance with all of its material loan covenants and obligations as of December 31, 2022. Cash Flows Operating -- Most of the Company s cash from operations is generated by rental income from its investment portfolio. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 115.8 million over 2021, primarily due to the increase in the size of the Company s real estate investment portfolio, as well as an increase in cash received upon settlement of outstanding interest rate swap agreements. Investing -- Net cash used in investing activities was 229.4 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. Acquisitions of properties during 2022 were 177.8 million higher than 2021, due to overall increases in the level of acquisition activity. Development costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 were 40.4 million higher than 2021, due to the increased number of development projects ongoing in 2022 as compared to 2021. Proceeds from asset sales decreased by 11.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Proceeds from asset sales are dependent on levels of disposition activity and the specific assets sold. Proceeds from asset sales are not necessarily comparable period-to-period. Financing -- Net cash provided by financing activities was 59.9 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock decreased 170.3 million due to the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock during September 2021 and no such preferred stock issuance in 2022. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased by 513.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, primarily to fund the increased level of acquisitions and ongoing developments in 2022. Net cash used related to the Revolving Credit Facility increased 128.0 million due to net repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility of 60 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net borrowings of 68.0 million during 2021. Cash used to repay mortgage notes payable increased 23.7 million during 2022 primarily due to the repayment of a mortgage note payable with a principal balance outstanding of 23.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 the annual common dividend rate, partially offset by the change from paying a quarterly dividend to paying a monthly dividend beginning in 2021. The Company distributed 7.4 million to preferred shareholders in 2022 compared to 1.5 million during 2021 as the preferred stock was issued in September 2021. In addition, the number of common shares outstanding increased in 2022 and 2021 due to the issuance of approximately 18.8 million and 11.2 million shares of common stock during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Further, the Company s declared dividend rate increased 7.7 to 2.805 per common share in 2022, up from 2.604 per common share in 2021.

Dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2022 included the monthly dividends declared in December 2021 through November 2022 while dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2021 included the quarterly dividend declared in December 2020 and the monthly dividends declared in January 2021 through November 2021.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the consolidated financial statements for a summary and anticipated impact of each accounting pronouncement on the Company s financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires the Company s management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Management bases estimates on the best information available at the time, its experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting principles would have been applied, resulting in different presentations of the consolidated financial statements. From time-to-time, the Company may re-evaluate its estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of the Company s critical accounting policies is included below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate The acquisition of property for investment purposes is typically accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to land, building, assumed debt, if any, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values and without giving rise to goodwill. In making estimates of fair values, the Company may use various sources, including data provided by independent third parties, as well as information obtained by the Company as a result of due diligence, including expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. Certain estimates, including those around market land values and market rental rates, are inherently subjective. While estimates of market land values and market rental rates are based on available market data, the application of market data to the unique nature of properties acquired may require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses. Impairments We review our real estate investments for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Events or circumstances that may occur include, but are not limited to, significant changes in real estate market conditions, estimated residual values, our ability or expectation to re-lease properties that are vacant or become vacant or a change in the anticipated holding period for a property. Identification of such events may involve certain assumptions, estimates, and significant judgment. Management determines whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), including the residual value of the real estate, to the carrying cost of the individual asset. Impairments are measured to the extent the current book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less disposition costs for any assets classified as held for sale. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions and/or purchase offers received from third parties. The Company may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. The expected cash flows of a property are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change, including (1) changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates and/or market conditions, (2) competition from other retail, (3)

 increases in operating costs, (4) bankruptcy and/or other changes in a tenant s condition and (5) expected holding period. These factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a property to change, and, as a result, an impairment could be considered to have occurred. Determination of the fair value of a property for purposes of measuring impairment may involve significant judgment. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Funds from Operations FFO or Nareit FFO FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. Nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate assets and/or changes in control, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and any impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operation. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the Company s operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Further, while the Company adheres to the Nareit definition of FFO, its presentation of FFO is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that all REITs may not use the same definition. Core Funds from Operations Core FFO The Company defines Core FFO as Nareit FFO with the addback of (i) noncash amortization of acquisition purchase price related to above- and below- market lease intangibles and discount on assumed mortgage debt and (ii) certain infrequently occurring items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that its measure of Core FFO facilitates useful comparison of performance to its peers who predominantly transact in sale-leaseback transactions and are thereby not required by GAAP to allocate purchase price to lease intangibles. Unlike many of its peers, the Company has acquired the substantial majority of its net-leased properties through acquisitions of properties from third parties or in connection with the acquisitions of ground leases from third parties. Core FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the Company s operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Further, the Company s presentation of Core FFO is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that all REITs may not use the same definition. Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO further adjusts FFO and Core FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income computed in accordance with GAAP. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Company s performance, however, AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance, or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The Company s computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore may not be comparable to such other REITs.

 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing activities. There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements. The Company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal payments presented in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt, by year of expected maturity, to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Average interest rates shown reflect the impact of the swap agreements described later in this section. 

2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Mortgage Notes Payable 5,527 963 1,026 629 42,250 50,395 Average Interest Rate 5.22 6.27 6.27 6.27 3.63 Revolving Credit Facility (1) 100,000 100,000 Average Interest Rate 5.14 Senior Unsecured Notes 50,000 50,000 1,710,000 1,810,000 Average Interest Rate 4.16 4.26 3.25 

 (1) The balloon payment balance includes the balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in January 2026, with options to extend the maturity date by six months up to two times, for a maximum maturity of January 2027. 
 The fair value is estimated to be 45.4 million and 1.54 billion for mortgage notes payable and senior unsecured notes, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility approximates its book value as its variable rate debt. The table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2022; it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, the Company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates. The Company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when the Company deems such conversion advantageous. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates, they also expose the Company to the risks that the other parties to the agreements will not perform. The Company could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under GAAP guidance. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, and the Company did not have any derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022.

 Item 9A: Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a15-(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our Company; 2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Agree Realty Corporation Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agree Realty Corporation (a Maryland corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 14, 2023

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Agree Realty Corporation Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agree Realty Corporation (a Maryland corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Fair value measurements used in the purchase price allocation of real estate acquisitions As described further in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the acquisition of property for investment purposes is typically accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including land, building, assumed debt, if any, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values and without giving rise to goodwill. During 2022, the Company purchased 434 retail net lease assets for approximately 1.6 billion. We identified the fair value measurements used in the purchase price allocation of real estate acquisitions as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination that the fair value measurements used in the purchase price allocation of real estate acquisitions are a critical audit matter is that auditing management s determination of fair value is

 challenging due to the high degree of auditor judgment necessary in evaluating certain assumptions made by management. Those significant assumptions include market land value and market rent. Our audit procedures related to the fair value measurements used in the purchase price allocation of real estate acquisitions included the following, among others. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquisitions, including controls over the selection and review of inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. For a selection of real estate acquisitions, our real estate valuation professionals evaluated the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value by comparing the Company s market land and market rent values to independently developed ranges using relevant market data derived from industry transaction databases and published industry reports. For a selection of real estate acquisitions and leases, we compared the Company s market land and market rent values to independently developed ranges for reasonableness and to consider if management bias was present. Our procedures included performing sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2013. February 14, 2023

 million and million, respectively. To the extent any of the tenants under these leases become unable to pay their contractual cash rents, the Company may be required to write down the straight-line rent receivable from those tenants, which would reduce rental income. The Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area where the property is located. In the event that collectability with respect to any tenant changes, the Company recognizes an adjustment to rental revenue. The Company s review of collectability of charges under its operating leases also includes any accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting rental revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had leases across tenants where collection is no longer considered probable. For these tenants, the Company is recording rental income on a cash basis and has written off any outstanding receivables, including straight-line rent receivables. Adjustments to rental revenue related to potentially uncollectible charges under these tenant leases resulted in a reduction to Rental Income and Net Income of million for the year-ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the tenant-specific collectability assessment performed, the Company may also recognize a general allowance, as a reduction to rental revenue, for its operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the potential for settlement of arrears. There was general allowance as of December 31, 2022 and million was recognized as of December 31, 2021. The Company s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. A portion of the Company s operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental revenue in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued, and the related revenue is earned. The balance of unbilled operating cost reimbursement receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was million and million, respectively. Unbilled operating cost reimbursement receivable is reflected in Accounts Receivable - Tenants, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has adopted the practical expedient in FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases ASC 842 that allows lessors to combine non-lease components with the lease components when the timing and patterns of transfer for the lease and non-lease components are the same and the lease is classified as an operating lease. As a result, all rentals and reimbursements pursuant to tenant leases are reflected as one line, Rental Income, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

 derivative outstanding as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company entered into an amendment to its Revolving Credit Facility which converted the interest rate from a spread over LIBOR to a spread over Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR subsequent to the termination of the LIBOR-indexed derivatives (see Note 5 Debt ). Going forward, the Company does not expect the guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (Topic 820) ASU 2022-03 ). ASU 2022-03 clarifies that contractual sale restrictions on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, are not considered in measuring the fair value of equity securities. In addition, the amendment requires the disclosure of: (1) the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions reflected in the balance sheet, (2) the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions, and (3) any circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendment is applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact of the guidance. leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of approximately years. A significant majority of its properties are leased to national tenants and approximately of its annualized base rent was derived from tenants, or parent entities thereof, with an investment grade credit rating from S P Global Ratings, Moody s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Substantially all of the Company s tenants are subject to net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and actual property operating expenses incurred, including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, the Company s tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on fixed amounts or increases in the consumer price index and certain leases provide for additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a specified level. Certain of the Company s properties are subject to leases under which it retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the property.

 Derivative liabilities - interest rate swaps December 31, 2021 Derivative assets - interest rate swaps Derivative liabilities - interest rate swaps Other Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, cash held in escrow, receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The Company estimated the fair value of its debt based on its incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements with the same remaining maturity and on the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made for other debt.

Unless otherwise directed by such L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to an L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) such L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided , however , that such L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.04(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the applicable L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

 (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, such L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

If the Borrower fails to so reimburse an L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

In such event, each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.04 .
 (iv) Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer.

No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse an L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of any L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(ii) , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the applicable L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Effective Federal Funds Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Loan Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of an L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Effective Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

At all times during the Availability Period (including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article V is not met), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Percentage, a per annum commitment fee equal to the daily aggregate amount of the Commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility Fee. Such fee shall be computed on a daily basis and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The Borrower acknowledges that such fee is a bona fide commitment fee and is intended as reasonable compensation to the Lenders for committing to make funds available to the Borrower as described herein and for no other purposes.
 (b) Other Fees . The Borrower shall pay to certain of the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts (i) fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters and (ii) such other fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at
 51 

the times specified.

(a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). ] Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.13(a) , bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 (b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower, the inaccurate reporting of the Credit Rating or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Pricing Level as determined by the Leverage Ratio calculated by the Borrower or the Credit Rating reported as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper determination of the Pricing Level would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.04(c)(iii) , 2.04(h) or 2.09(b) or under Article IX . The Borrower s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
 2.12 Evidence of Debt. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to any of its Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) , each Revolving Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and
 52 

Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 2.13 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent s Clawback. (a) General . All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its applicable share as provided herein of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
 (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Effective Federal Funds Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or an L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the 53 

Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Effective Federal Funds Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due. (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 (d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c) .
 (e) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
 2.14 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or in the case of a Revolving Lender, the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it, resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans, and if applicable, subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans, of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that:
 (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
 (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.17 , or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee
 54 

or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 2.15 Extension of Maturity Date. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall have the option to extend the Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the Applicable Maturity Date twice, each time, for an additional six (6) months from the Applicable Maturity Date (the Extension Option ), subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

 (ii) As of the date of the Borrower s request to exercise the Extension Option and as of the Applicable Maturity Date no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, provided that if such Default requires the giving of notice by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.01 , such notice shall have been given;
 (iii) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Applicable Maturity Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such extension (such certification to confirm that such resolutions remain in effect and have not been modified since the adoption thereof) and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article VI and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of the Borrower s request to exercise the Extension Option and as of the Applicable Maturity Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.15 , the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 6.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) , respectively, of Section 7.01 , and (B) no Default has occurred and is continuing;
 (iv) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Compliance Certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations required to show that the Loan Parties are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement;
 (v) No later than the Applicable Maturity Date the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent (for the pro rata benefit of the Revolving Lenders) an extension fee in the amount of 0.0625 of the then-current Commitments; and
 (vi) The Borrower shall have paid all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and all reasonable fees and expenses paid to third party consultants (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such extension.
 55

 1,750,000,000 (as reduced by the amount of any permanent reduction of the Commitments under the Facility). Each such Increase Request must be an aggregate minimum amount of 10,000,000 and integral multiples of 5,000,000 in excess thereof. The Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, shall manage all aspects of the syndication of such increase in the Commitments, including decisions as to the selection of the existing Lenders and/or other banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders to be approached with respect to such increase in Commitments, and the allocations of the increase in the Commitments, among such existing Lenders and/or other banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders. Promptly after delivery of the Increase Request to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall enter into an engagement letter with the Administrative Agent for the Facility governing, among other things, the syndication of such increase in the Commitments, and which shall include, among other things, the fees of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent with respect to such Increase Request. Any additional Commitments established pursuant to this Section shall be regarded as Commitments hereunder and accordingly shall have the same maturity date as, bear interest at the same rates as, and otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions of, the Loans of the Facility outstanding hereunder at the time such additional Commitments are established. No Lender shall be obligated in any way whatsoever to increase its Commitment or provide a new Commitment, as applicable, and any new Lender becoming a party to this Agreement in connection with any such requested increase must be an Eligible Assignee.

 56 

Borrower shall pay such fees to the Administrative Agent, for its own account and for the benefit of the Lenders providing such additional Commitments, as determined at the time of such increase. (c) If in connection with an Increase Request, a new Revolving Lender becomes a party to this Agreement or any existing Revolving Lender is increasing its Commitment, such Lender shall on the date it becomes a Revolving Lender hereunder (or in the case of an existing Revolving Lender, increases its Commitment) (and as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Revolving Lenders its Applicable Revolving Percentage (determined with respect to the Revolving Lenders respective Commitments after giving effect to the requested increase of Commitments) of any outstanding Revolving Loans, by making available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such other Revolving Lenders, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans to be purchased by such Lender. The Borrower shall pay to the Revolving Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Revolving Lenders under Section 3.05 as a result of any resulting prepayment of any such Revolving Loans.
 
 (d) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.14 or 11.01 to the contrary. 2.17 Cash Collateral. 
 (a) Certain Credit Support Events . Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or an L/C Issuer (i) if such L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Revolving Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, an L/C Issuer or a Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender).
 (b) Grant of Security Interest .

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. 
 
 (c) Application . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.17 or Sections 2.04 , 2.05 , 2.06 , 2.18 or 9.02 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.

satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. (iii) Certain Fees . A Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender (x) shall be entitled to receive a facility fee pursuant to Section 2.10(a) for any period during which such Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans funded by such Revolving Lender and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.04(h) . With respect to any facility fee not required to be paid to a Defaulting Lender pursuant to subclause (x) of the foregoing sentence, the Borrower shall (A) be required to pay to each of the L/C Issuers and the Swing Line Lenders, as applicable, the amount of such fee allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (B) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender.
 
 (iv) Reallocation of Applicable Revolving Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure . During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 2.05 , the Applicable Revolving Percentage of each such non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided , that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each such non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of that Lender.
 (b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and solely in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, the Swing Line Lenders and the L/C Issuers, agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Committed Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders (without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) ), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.
 2.19 Reallocation on the Closing Date . The Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Revolving Lender agree that upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, the amount of each of the Commitments of such Revolving Lender is as set forth on Schedule 1.01(A) attached hereto.
 59

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(b) If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate SOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan or (ii) the Eurodollar the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Term SOFR Loan or the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate with respect to a proposed Daily Simple SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate SOFR Loans of the affected Type or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
