Overview 

We are a specialty finance
company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and,
to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger
vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories
or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating
sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions
and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts
directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment
purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans
from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as automobile contracts. 

We were incorporated and began
our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have purchased a total of approximately 20.0 billion of automobile
contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately 822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions
in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2022 are shown
in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties.

Our principal executive offices
are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting
functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches.
We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, and Illinois branches. 

Most of our contract acquisitions
volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish
relationships with dealers through our employee sales representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract
purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our sales representatives represent us exclusively. They
may work from our Irvine branch, our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in
their geographic area. Our sales representatives present dealers with a sales package, which includes our promotional material containing
the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation
relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we had 90 sales representatives, and in that month, we received applications
from 8,078 dealers in 47 states. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 75 of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that
sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. 

We also solicit credit applications
directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified
applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive
loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer
of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. 

1 

During the year ended December
31, 2022 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 3.2 of our total acquisitions and represented
2.7 of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one
of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and
demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022 approximately 91 of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 9 consisted
of financing for new cars. 

We generally solicit applications
with the intent of originating contracts to hold as investments in our own portfolio. However, in May 2021 we began purchasing some contracts
for immediate sale to a third-party to whom we refer applications that do not meet our lending criteria. We service all such contracts
on behalf of the third-party. 

For contracts we originate
for our own portfolio, we generally finance them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which
we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes
to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 95 term
securitizations of approximately 17.7 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit
facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December
31, 2022, we had two such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of 200 million. 

Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry 

Automobile financing is the
second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants
choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant s
business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less
credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. 

Traditional automobile finance
companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend
to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime
segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger
financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company
having a dominant position in the market. 

Our automobile financing programs
are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers
who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged
in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. 

Coronavirus Pandemic 

In December 2019, a new strain
of coronavirus (the COVID-19 virus originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout
the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report
to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as the pandemic. In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied
with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking
various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10 of
our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2022, most of
our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic.

Contract Acquisitions 

When a retail automobile buyer
elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer
will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer s decision to choose a financing
source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged
to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency, and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround
time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to
us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. For the year ended December
31, 2022, we received 2.5 million applications. Approximately 63 of all applications came through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership
application aggregator), 36 via another aggregator, Route One and 1 via our website. A portion of the DealerTrack and Route One volume
are applications from our pass-through arrangements with other lenders who send us applications from their dealers in cases where those
lenders choose not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, such pass-through applications represented 13 
of our total applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision
within seconds on approximately 99 of those applications. 

Upon receipt an application,
if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history and
an alternative data credit score provided by a major credit reporting bureau. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning
system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the applicant and structure of the automobile financing contract
meets our criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. For applications
that do not meet our criteria, we may forward them to one or more business partners who also invest in subprime automobile contracts.
In the case of one third-party partner, as described above, we may purchase contracts they approve, followed by immediate resale to them,
after which we retain the servicing. If this third-party declines the application, we advise the dealer that we will not purchase the
contract. Other partners to whom we refer applications may or may not choose to purchase such contracts by working directly with the dealers
who submitted the applications. Unless otherwise notated, contract origination and managed portfolio data discussed herein includes third-party
contracts. 

Dealers with which we do business
are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, no dealer accounted for as much as 1 of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. 

Under our direct lending platform,
the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications
and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as
described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether we would grant them credit and on what terms. 

The following table sets forth
the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records)
during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

We purchase automobile contracts
from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee,
which may be comprised of multiple components and which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay.
The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based
on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average
net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on contracts purchased for our own portfolio for
the periods shown:

Our pricing strategy is driven
by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and maximizing our risk adjusted yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees
are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has been robust over the periods presented, and by our pricing strategy.
We make changes to our pricing algorithm based on our volume goals, our own costs for borrowing and periodic recalibration of our risk-based
scoring models. 

We have offered eight different
financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the sub-prime credit
spectrum and are labeled as follows: 

First Time Buyer 
 This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the
applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value
ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. 

Mercury / Delta 
 This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit.
As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down
payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. 

4 

Standard 
 This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing
credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta
programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. 

Alpha 
This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition,
the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and
dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. 

Alpha Plus 
This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as
auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower
than the Alpha program. 

Super Alpha 
 This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing
credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer
acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. 

Preferred 
- This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing
credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat
higher than the Super Alpha program. 

Meta - This
program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a stronger history of recent performing credit than
the Preferred program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than
the Preferred program. 

Our upper credit tier products,
which are our Meta, Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 80 of our new contract acquisitions
for our own portfolio in 2022, 75 in 2021, and 75 in 2020, measured by aggregate amount financed.

We attempt to control misrepresentation
regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining
professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer
agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract if the dealer breaches its
representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources
to satisfy their repurchase obligations to us. 

Contract Funding 

For automobile contracts that
we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under
our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a
first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our funding criteria. In addition, each automobile
contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may,
nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required
by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. 

Our technology and human expertise
provides for a 360-degree evaluation of an applicant s employment and residence stability, income level and affordability, and creditworthiness
in relation to the desired collateral securing the automobile contract. This perspective is used to assign application and structure allowances
and limits related to price, term, amount of down payment, monthly payment, and interest rate; type of vehicle; and principal amount of
the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle. 

Specifically, our funding
guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115 of wholesale book value in the case
of used vehicles or to 115 of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when
the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer s casualty policy in the
event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 12 model years old or have more
than 200,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 78 months, although we consider the program, amount financed, and mileage
as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from
time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our funding staff verify the customer's employment,
income, residency, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus
and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms
of the related automobile contract. During this welcome call, 
we also ask the customer a series of open-ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. 

Credit Scoring . We
use proprietary scoring models to assign two internal credit scores at the time the application is received. These proprietary
scores are used to help determine whether we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either
to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety
of parameters including traditional and alternative credit history, data derived from other sources such as house/rental payment, length
of employment, residence stability and total income. When the dealer proposes a structure for the contract, our scores consider various
deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value, payment to income, make and model, vehicle class, and mileage. We
have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio.
We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the
risk inherent in the sub-prime market. 

Characteristics of Contracts. All
the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All
automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination,
of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Dealer Compliance . The
dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration
of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile
contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle
in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state
registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer to rectify
the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. 

Coronavirus Pandemic 

Beginning in April 2020, we
experienced a decrease in monthly contract purchase volumes which continued through December 2020. Since January 2021, our contract purchase
levels have returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic levels. 

Servicing and Collections 

We currently service all automobile
contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts we service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on
the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; contacting obligors whose
payments are late; accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action
to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; skip tracing; repossessing and liquidating the
collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral.
For contracts that we securitize, we are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5 per annum computed as
a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts . The servicing fee is included
in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. For contracts we service
for third parties, we receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5 , and certain other incentive fees tied to credit performance. 

Collection Procedures. We
believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection
approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers
to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active
collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance
of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations,
which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection
activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers.
We engage a nearshore third-party call center to supplement the efforts the collectors in our five branch locations. As of December 31,
2022, our nearshore partner had approximately 33 agents assigned to our portfolio. 

We attempt to make telephonic
contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our risk-based assessment of
the customer s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send
automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message
instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our customers can contact us via a toll-free number where they may choose to speak with
a collector or to use our automated voice response system to access information about their account or to make a payment. They may respond
to our collector s text messages or chat with one of our collectors while logged into our website. Our contact priorities may be
based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer
the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector attempts to get the customer to make an electronic
payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer
makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the
payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the
payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector s queue
for subsequent contacts. 

7 

If a customer fails to make
or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will
review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision
will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific
circumstances. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of repossessions is incorporated
into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value,
we suspend interest accruals on contracts where the vehicle has been repossessed and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance
to other assets. In addition, we apply a specific reserve to such contracts so that the net balance represents the estimated remaining
balance after the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle are applied, net of related costs. 

If we elect to repossess the
vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law.
Upon repossession it is stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Prior to sale,
the customer has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the contract in full. In some cases, we may return the vehicle to the customer
if they pay all, or what we deem to be a sufficient amount, of the past due amount. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally
resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to
the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation
in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency
for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize
in collecting such accounts. 

Contracts originated since
January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of late payments is incorporated into the estimated net yield on
those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals
on contracts once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent. We do not recognize additional interest income until
the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower, regardless of their stage
of delinquency are first applied to outstanding accrued interest and then to principal reduction. 

We generally charge off the
balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past
due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle
has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference
between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. 

Credit Experience 

Our primary method of monitoring
ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related
trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early
in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months,
after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was
25 months, 23 months, and 23 months as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our financial results
are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as
pandemic, recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted
average age of the receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession, and net credit loss experience
of all such automobile contracts that we own as of the respective dates shown.

amount of all automobile contracts we purchased, including automobile contracts we subsequently sold in securitization transactions that
we continue to service. The table does not include certain contracts we have serviced for third parties on which we earn servicing fees
only, and have no credit risk. 
 
 (2) We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90 of a contractually due payment by the following
due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on
the number of days payments are contractually past due. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not included. The delinquency
aging categories shown in the tables reflect the effect of extensions. 

(3) Amount in repossession represents the contract balance on financed vehicles that have been repossessed but not yet liquidated. 

(4) We do not recognize interest income on accounts past due more than 90 days.

Extensions 

In certain circumstances we
will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be
permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than eight over the life of the contract. The only modification
of terms is to advance the obligor s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension,
and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a
reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant
delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. 

The basic question in deciding to grant an extension
is whether we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being
able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed
without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime
losses, getting the obligor s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize
us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary
problem that may be resolved with an extension. 

The credit assessment for granting an extension
is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments
the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2)
whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making
regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and
(4) the obligor s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is
a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to
offering the extension to the obligor. During 2020 we incorporated an algorithmic extension score card which provides our staff with an
objective and quantitative assessment of whether or not a obligor is a good candidate for an extension, based on the current circumstances
of the account. The extension score card was developed by our internal risk management team and is derived from the post-extension performance
of accounts in our managed portfolio. 

After receiving an extension,
an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs.
We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables.
The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2022, for accounts that received extensions from 2012 through 2021: 

Period of Extension 
 # of Extensions Granted 
 Active or Paid Off at December
 31, 2022 
 Active or Paid Off at December
 31, 2022 
 Charged Off > 6 Months
 After Extension 
 Charged Off > 6 Months
 After Extension 
 Charged Off 

We view these results as a
confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off
as of December 31, 2022 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment
in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted, and we would have likely incurred a substantial
loss and no additional interest revenue. 

11 

For extension accounts that
ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful.
In such cases, despite the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have
received. 

Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below:

Non-Accrual Receivables 

It is not uncommon for our
obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection
efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist
our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations to avoid losing their vehicle
to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely
than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior
to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are
greater than 90 days past due. 

If an obligor exceeds the
90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days
delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting
purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest
and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his
delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the
contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. 

12 

Our policy for placing a contract
on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension
was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly
current). 

Securitization of Automobile Contracts 

Throughout the period for which
information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis
through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification
of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries,
and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may
be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. 

When structured to be treated
as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and
the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize
interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record
as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for
finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that
internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables
because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. 

Since 1994 we have conducted
95 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of those securitizations
are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning
of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020.
In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets
in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. 

Our history of term securitizations, over the most
recent ten years, is summarized in the table below:

From time to time we have
also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16,
2018, we completed a 40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest
financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased 40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen
CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80 interest in a CPS affiliate that owns
the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes 2018-1 Notes ), issued by CPS Auto
Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595 . The remaining balance on the notes were paid in full on
February 16, 2022. 

On June 30, 2021, we completed
a 50.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction,
qualified institutional buyers purchased 50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in three CPS securitizations
consecutively conducted from January 2018 through July 2018, and an 80 interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in
the eight CPS securitizations conducted from December 2018 through September 2020. The sold notes 2021-1 Notes ), issued
by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86 . As of December 31, 2022, the notes had a principal
balance of 50.0 million. 

Generally, prior to a securitization
transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term
funding capacity is 400 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility
was most recently renewed in July 2022, extending the revolving period to July 2024, with an optional amortization period through July
2025. In addition, the capacity was doubled from 100 million to 200 million at the July 2022 renewal. 

In November 2015, we entered
into another 100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January
2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2026. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from 100 million to
 200 million. 

In a securitization and in
our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations
and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or
warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid
interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at
a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will
bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. 

Whether a securitization is
treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to
release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such
releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of
securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless
of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. 

Certain of our securitization
transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results.
Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain
securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default
if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

14 

Competition 

The automobile financing business
is highly competitive. We compete with several national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition,
competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions
providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile
manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel
and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital
in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger,
more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments
and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers
and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers,
which we do not offer. 

We believe that the principal
competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly
payment amount made available to the dealer s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness
of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness
of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile
contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying
automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. 

Regulation 

Numerous federal and state
consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain
disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is
required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations
on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide
certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation
of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us
and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date
of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts
and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be
obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have
the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including
our methods of collection. 

We are subject to supervision
and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB ), a federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority
over non-banks, including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies
from engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services,
and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority
to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. 

The Dodd-Frank Act and related
regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive
balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank
Act s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the
entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services
industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. 

15 

In addition to the CFPB, other
state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism
for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our
business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that
the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. 

We believe that we are currently
in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will
be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material
adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement
of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements
than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented
nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in
litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these
actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection
with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Human Capital 

We rely on our employees for
everything we do. To make our business work, we seek to supply them with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed. In addition to
new hire training, we provide mentor programs and management workshops. 

Workforce Allocation and
Diversity We had 792 employees as of December 31, 2022. Our employee population was 66 female, and 67 self-identified as ethnically
diverse (defined as all EEOC classifications other than white). Broken out by function, our human capital was allocated thus: 11 were
senior management personnel; 407 were servicing personnel; 182 were automobile contract origination personnel; 127 were sales personnel
and program development (78 of whom were sales representatives); 65 were various administrative personnel including human resources, legal,
accounting and systems. 

Compensation and benefits 
Our compensation policy is to be market competitive. We offer a benefits and wellness package that includes healthcare coverage, defined
contribution retirement benefits, and other components. 

Employee Engagement 
Our means of evaluating our human capital resources include, on an individual basis, annual performance reviews and annual meetings with
senior management on or close to the employee s anniversary date. On an aggregate basis, a new hire survey and department
round table meetings. The feedback from the meetings and survey results are reviewed by senior management and used to assist in reviewing
our human capital strategies, programs, and practices. Other metrics used in human capital management include average employee tenure
and annual turnover rate. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our business, operating results
and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could
decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in
which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below,
we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations
and the value of our common stock. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial
Debt. 

To service our existing substantial
indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful
financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond
our control. These factors include, without limitation: 

the economic and competitive conditions in the asset-backed securities market; 
 
 the performance of our current and future automobile contracts; 
 
 the performance of our residual interests from our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities; 
 
 any operating difficulties or pricing pressures we may experience; 
 
 our ability to obtain credit enhancement for our securitizations; 
 
 our ability to establish and maintain dealer relationships; 
 
 the passage of laws or regulations that affect us adversely; 
 
 our ability to compete with our competitors; and 
 
 our ability to acquire and finance automobile contracts. 

Depending upon the outcome
of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy
all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our
debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness
or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could
require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. 

We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. 

We have historically funded
our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations
and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not
be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the
capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization
due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently
we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through
January 2023. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
have been from time to time in the past and may be in the future materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of
cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: 

acquire automobile contracts; 
 
 fund overcollateralization in warehouse credit facilities and securitizations; 
 
 pay securitization fees and expenses; 
 
 fund spread accounts in connection with securitizations; 
 
 satisfy working capital requirements and pay operating expenses; 
 
 pay taxes; and 
 
 pay interest expense. 

17 

Historically we have matched our liquidity needs
to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There
can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. 

Periods of Significant Losses. 

From time to time throughout
our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending
with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole,
for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a
decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31,
1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31,
2005. 

We expect to earn quarterly
profits during 2023; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking
statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption Forward-Looking Statements in this report.
We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the Risk Factors section of this report,
and also under the caption Forward-Looking Statements. One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income
in each of the eleven fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, although not in every quarter within that period. 

Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability
to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. 

We depend on various financing
sources, including credit facilities, our securitization program and other secured and unsecured debt issuances, to finance our business
operations. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and
contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are warehoused until
they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under
one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is 400 million, comprising
two credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of 200 million. Both warehouse credit facilities have a revolving period during
which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further
advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity . 

Our access to financing sources
depends upon our financial position, general market conditions, availability of bank liquidity, the bank regulatory environment, our compliance
with covenants imposed under our financing agreements, the credit quality of the collateral we can pledge to support secured financings,
and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to maintain warehouse or securitization financing on acceptable terms, we might
curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. 

Our Substantial Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial
Health and Prevent Us From Fulfilling Our Obligations Under Our Existing Indebtedness 

We currently have and will
continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,469.0 million of debt
outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of 2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included 285.3 million of warehouse
lines of credit, 49.6 million of residual interest financing debt and 25.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. Our ability to make
payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, and our ability
to enter into additional credit facilities and securitization transactions as well as other debt financings, which, to a certain extent,
are subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control. 

If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flows in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to obtain
additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained
on acceptable terms. The inability to service or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. 

18 

The degree to which we are leveraged creates risks,
including: 

we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness; 
 
 we may find it more difficult to fund future credit enhancement requirements, operating costs, tax payments, capital expenditures
or general corporate expenditures; 
 
 we may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to payments on our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing
the funds available for operations and future business opportunities; and 
 
 increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry and capital markets conditions. 
 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and 
 
 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds. 

Although we believe we are
able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits,
our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various
remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our
earnings. 

Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize
Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. 

We depend upon our ability
to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By permanent financing 
we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment
as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against
the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made
to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction
will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors
beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: 

market conditions; 
 
 the approval by all parties of the terms of the securitization; 
 
 our ability to acquire a sufficient number of automobile contracts for securitization. 

During 2008 and 2009 we observed
adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization
transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for
asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables.
We experienced improvements in the capital markets from 2010 through 2019, during which time we completed 36 securitizations. In April
2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which
our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular
quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2023. However, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse,
we would expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual
Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. 

When we finance our automobile
contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed.
Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest
represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal
paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts
and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility.
We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as excess spread cash flows. 

19 

Under the financial structures
we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to
the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization
trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. 

While the specific terms and
mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread
cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency,
defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In
the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse
credit facility: 

may require increased credit enhancement, including an increase in the amount required to be on deposit in the spread account to be
accumulated for the particular pool; and 

in certain circumstances, may permit affected parties to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the securitized or warehoused
contracts from us to an unaffiliated servicer. 

We typically retain residual
interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual
interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on
how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile
contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests,
or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such a reduction,
if it should occur, could have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Our Results of Operations May be Affected by Changing Economic
Conditions 

We are subject to changes
in general economic conditions that are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults,
repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods also may be accompanied by increased unemployment rates, inflation, decreased
demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding receivables, which weakens collateral values and increases
the amount of a loss in the event of default. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, declining stock market values, unstable real estate
values, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit, changes in vehicle ownership trends and other factors
that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease demand for automobiles as well as weaken
collateral values on certain types of automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase
without a corresponding increase in our revenue. No assurance can be given that the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ
will afford adequate protection against these risks. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, defaults, repossessions or losses
or increased servicing costs could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into
future financing transactions. 

We sell repossessed automobiles
at wholesale auction markets located throughout the United States. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result in, or increase,
a loss upon our disposition of repossessed vehicles and we may be unable to collect the resulting deficiency balances. Depressed wholesale
prices for used automobiles may result from manufacturer incentives or discounts on new vehicles, financial difficulties of new vehicle
manufacturers, discontinuance of vehicle brands and models, increased used vehicle inventory resulting from significant liquidations of
rental or fleet inventories and increased trade-ins due to promotional programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, higher
gasoline prices may decrease the wholesale auction values of certain types of vehicles. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from the
depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or low retail demand could result in higher
losses for us. Further, we are dependent on the efficient operation of the wholesale auction markets. If the operations of the wholesale
auction markets are disrupted, as they were during the recent COVID 19 pandemic, we may be unable to sell our used vehicles at sufficient
volume and/or pricing. 

20 

The number of delinquencies,
defaults, losses and repossessions on sub-prime automobile receivables has historically been significantly influenced by the employment
status of obligors on automobile loan contracts. Any general weakness in the economy may affect sub-prime obligors more strongly than
the population as a whole. 

Furthermore, the global financial
markets have at times experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt
of various countries. Concerns regarding sovereign debt may spread to other countries at any time. There can be no assurance that this
uncertainty relating to the sovereign debt of various countries will not lead to further disruption of the financial and credit markets
in the United States, which could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into
future financing transactions. 

A deterioration in economic
conditions and certain economic factors, such as reduced business activity, high unemployment, interest rates, housing prices, energy
prices (including the price of gasoline), increased consumer indebtedness (including of obligors on the receivables), lack of available
credit, the rate of inflation (such as the recent increase in inflation) and consumer perceptions of the economy, as well as other factors,
such as terrorist events, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, public health emergencies, extreme weather conditions or significant changes in
the geopolitical environment (such as the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia) and/or public policy, including increased
state, local or federal taxation, could adversely affect the ability and willingness of obligors to meet their payment obligations under
the receivables we originate. Our operating results could be adversely affected if obligors are unable to make timely payments on their
receivables or if we elect to, or are required to, implement forbearance programs in connection with obligors suffering a hardship (including
hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic conditions). 

The above described negative
economic factors, as well as others, have also historically resulted in decreased consumer demand for motor vehicles, which may result
in an increase in the inventory of used motor vehicles and depress the price at which repossessed motor vehicles may be sold or delay
the timing of those sales. If the default rate on our receivables increases and the price at which the vehicles may be sold at auction
declines, our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions may be adversely
affected. 

If Interest Rates Rise, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

Our principal means of financing
our portfolio of automobile contracts is to issue asset-backed notes in securitizations. The interest payable on such notes is our largest
expense. Although such expense is fixed with respect to issued securitization trust debt, the terms of future securitizations may vary. 

The credit spread between
the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. The Federal Reserve
increased interest rates multiple times in 2022, once in early 2023, and is expected to continue to raise rates further in 2023. If interest
rates on risk-free debt continue to increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased
interest expense, If interest rates in general should rise, our expenses would likewise rise, to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. 

If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors,
Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

The automobile financing business
is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential
competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies,
credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with
major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors
and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including
greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources
which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital
relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide
other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not
offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase
automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available
to us. 

21 

If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile
Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

We are dependent upon establishing
and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1 of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements
we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase.
The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or
the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience
Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

We specialize in the purchase
and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low
income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses
than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting
criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime
customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. 

If automobile contracts that
we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity,
depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the
automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing
an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile
contract and the related costs of recovery. 

For our receivables originated
prior to January 2018, we maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our
estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated.. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses
in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Receivables originated since
January 2018 are recorded at fair value and incorporate estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses. If actual credit
losses were to exceed our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a fair value adjustment to those
receivables or reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. 

In addition, under the terms
of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that
are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse
credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. 

If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts,
Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. 

We are entitled to receive
servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities
and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: 

our failure generally to observe and perform our responsibilities and other covenants; 
 
 certain bankruptcy events; or 
 
 the occurrence of certain events of default under the documents governing the facilities. 

The loss of our servicing
rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to
a material portion of our managed portfolio. 

22 

If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

Our senior management team
averages over 20 years of service with us. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of
our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part
upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for
such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse
general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform
in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect
our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 

If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations
May Be Impaired. 

Failure to materially comply
with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business
is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: 

require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications; 
 
 limit the interest rates, fees and other charges we are allowed to charge; 
 
 limit or prescribe certain other terms of our automobile contracts; 
 
 require specific disclosures to our customers; 
 
 define our rights to repossess and sell collateral; and 
 
 maintain safeguards designed to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information. 

Our industry is also at times
investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the
assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission FTC have the authority
to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at their own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek
monetary penalties. The FTC conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to
which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. A host of
state and local governmental agencies have jurisdiction over material portions of our business, and might take action adverse to us. No
assurance can be given as to whether any of such hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. 

If we fail to comply with
applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or
the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules
or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore,
judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences
as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result
in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

We believe that we are in
compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse
effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: 

applicable laws and regulations; 
 
 changes in existing laws or regulations; 
 
 changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations; or 
 
 any additional laws or regulations that may be enacted in the future. 

23 

Changes in Law and Regulations May Have
an Adverse Effect on Our Business. 

Existing law, regulations and
interpretations may change in ways that increase our costs of compliance. 

In addition to direct costs,
such compliance requires changes in forms, processes, procedures, controls and in the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance
may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the
protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys 
fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. 

At this time, it is difficult
to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations
may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For
example, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental,
governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may adopt new investment policies
or otherwise impose new expectations that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors, any or all of which
may have negative effects on our business and/or reputation. 

Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity
and Increase Our Capital Requirements. 

Securitizations of automobile
receivables executed after December 2016 have been and will be subject to risk retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors
of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS
issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Because
the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage, our securitization structures may require more capital
of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. 

If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of
Operations May Be Impaired. 

We operate in a litigious
society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits
under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws.
Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both
the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation,
and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the FTC, the CFPB and other governmental bodies relating to our activities.
The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive
damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts
that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies
in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters
involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements
of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or
investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management s attention from the operation of our business.
Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial
conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and
statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a
plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant
in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry
and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial.
The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. 

24 

While we intend to vigorously
defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could
be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. 

Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations,
regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. 

From time to time there are
negative news stories about the sub-prime credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory
actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally
could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. 

If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or
Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

We are dependent on our receivables
originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage
or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events.
A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our
systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third
parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation
and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions
in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
financial conditions and cash flows. 

A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure
of confidential information or subject us to liability 

We hold in our systems confidential
financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although
we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can
be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. 

It is possible that we may
not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security
breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can
originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external
service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. 

Such persons may also attempt
to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or
that of our customers. 

These risks may increase in
the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products
and applications. 

A successful penetration of
the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential
information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss
to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could
have a material adverse effect on us. 

25 

Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit
Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. 

The terms of our existing
credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and
our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities,
results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain
transactions, including the following: 

incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness; 
 
 making capital expenditures in excess of agreed upon amounts; 
 
 paying dividends or other distributions to our shareholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock or subordinated
obligations; 
 
 making investments; 
 
 creating or permitting liens on our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries; 
 
 issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries; 
 
 transferring or selling our assets; 
 
 engaging in mergers or consolidations; 
 
 permitting a change of control of our company; 
 
 liquidating, winding up or dissolving our company; 
 
 changing our name or the nature of our business, or the names or nature of the business of our subsidiaries; and 
 
 engaging in transactions with our affiliates outside the normal course of business. 

These restrictions may limit
our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply
with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding
from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become
immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement,
would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness
could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even
if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our
indebtedness as it becomes due. 

In addition, the transaction
documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend
or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption,
retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the
time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to
the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect
of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. 

Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting 

Receivables we ve
acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. 

If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from
Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. 

We
recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based
the terms of the receivables and our estimates at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables. Such estimates
include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were
to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates,
we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. 

26 

If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from
Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. 

We
re-evaluate the recorded value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield
a value materially different from the previous recorded value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed
our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we
might be required to adjust the recorded value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce
our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. 

If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market
Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Recorded Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value
for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. 

The
fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as
ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates
of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our recorded
value, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly
reduce our income and book value. 

Risks Related to General Factors 

If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States
Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

Our business is directly related
to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions.
Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime
customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic
conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Ohio, Texas,
and Florida, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession
could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The
timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the
dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. 

The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Have Adverse Effects 

The COVID-19 virus has spread the pandemic throughout the world. The pandemic has had adverse effects on the economy of the United States (notably a significant decrease in employment)
and the global economy in general. The long-term effects of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the pandemic are
unknown. The extent to which obligors on our automobile contracts may be adversely affected by the pandemic (including a resurgence due
to variants of COVID-19), by loss of employment, and by related efforts of governments to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout
the nation and world cannot be predicted. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the ability of obligors to make timely
payments to us. 

Finally, and depending on the extent to which
the pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described
in this Risk Factors section, such as those related to our business or operations, the ability or willingness of our customers
to make timely payments, and risks of geographic concentrations. 

27 

Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural
Disasters. 

Our automobile contracts are
geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake
in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material
number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either
case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in
our revenues or the cash flows available to us. 

Effect of Social, Economic and Other Factors on Losses. 

The ability of our customers to make payments
on automobile contracts will be affected by a variety of social and economic factors, most notably the extent to which our customers remain
gainfully employed. Other economic factors include interest rates, general unemployment levels, the rate of inflation, adjustments in
monthly mortgage payments and consumer perceptions of economic conditions generally and the effect of government stimulus programs and
consumer protection/payment relief efforts implemented in connection with the COVID-19 virus. Social factors include changes in consumer
confidence levels, consumer attitudes toward bankruptcy and the repayment of indebtedness and consumer perceptions of political events
and shifts, which may be affected by the pandemic. We are generally unable to determine whether or to what extent economic or social factors
will affect the performance of our portfolio of automobile contracts, but caution that a recession or depression in local, regional or
national economies would be expected to increase delinquencies and losses, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. 

If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our
Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. 

Our profitability is largely
determined by the difference, or spread, between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we
acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations.
In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed
securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in
the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when
purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that
such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing
interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings
and cash flows. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. 

Our stock is thinly-traded,
which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our
common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common
stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December
31, 2022, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 6.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 31 . 

We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. 

We have never declared or
paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends
in the foreseeable future. See Dividend Policy .

Forward-Looking Statements 

Discussions of certain matters
contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among
other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing
the words will,

performance and achievements may differ materially from the results, performance and achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking
statements. The discussion under Risk Factors 
identifies some of the factors that might cause such a difference, including the following: 

unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plague; 

mandates imposed in reaction to such events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity; 

changes in general economic conditions; 

changes in performance of our automobile contracts; 

increases in interest rates; 

our ability to generate sufficient operating and financing cash flows; 

competition; 

level of losses incurred on contracts in our managed portfolio; and 

adverse decisions by courts or regulators

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

Not applicable. 

Item 2. Properties 

Our principal executive offices
are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated
lessor. The annual base rent is approximately 1.8 million through 2023. 

Our operating headquarters
are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 69,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated
lessor. The annual base rent is approximately 2.5 million through 2024. 

The remaining three regional
servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Oak
Brook, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2023 to 2029. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately
 1.4 million.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved
in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers
can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes
allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which
we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. 

Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency
judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were
not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed.
The defendant s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis,
not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. In April 2022, a
motion for certification of a class was filed but has not been ruled upon. It is reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims
will be on a class basis. 

Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018,
a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified
our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective
provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney
fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date
of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to
our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. 

Massachusetts Civil Investigative
Demand . In September 2021, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts relating to the Company s communications with and repossession notices sent to Massachusetts customers. We are cooperating
with the inquiry. 

In General. There can be no assurance as
to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2022,
our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above. The amount of losses that
may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that
the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2022 is 4.9 million, and that the range of reasonably
possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31,
2022 does not exceed 11.2 million. 

Accordingly, we believe that
the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors,
the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or
incorporated by reference herein. 

Overview 

We are a specialty finance
company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and,
to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger
vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories
or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating
sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions
and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts
directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment
purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans
from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as automobile contracts. 

We were incorporated and began
our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have originated a total of approximately 20.0 billion of automobile
contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured
by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately 822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers
and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December
31, 2022 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties.

Our principal executive offices
are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting
functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches.
We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. 

The programs we offer to dealers
and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile
contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which
we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the
purchase of the pool of contracts from us.

Coronavirus Pandemic 

In December 2019, a new strain
of coronavirus (the COVID-19 virus originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout
the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report
to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as the pandemic. In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied
with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking
various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10 of
our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2022, most of
our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. 

Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities 

Throughout the period for which information is
presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations,
and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts,
sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities
to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted
accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structured
as secured financings. 

When structured to be treated as a secured financing
for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear
as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income
on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before
2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017
we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts. 

Since 1994 we have conducted
95 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of those securitizations
are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning
of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020.
In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets
in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. 

Our recent history of term securitizations is summarized
in the table below:

Generally, prior to a securitization
transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term
funding capacity is 400 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility
was most recently renewed in July 2022, extending the revolving period to July 2024, with an optional amortization period through July
2025. In addition, the capacity was doubled from 100 million to 200 million at the July 2022 renewal. 

In November 2015, we entered
into another 100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January
2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2026. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from 100 million to
 200 million. 

We previously had a third facility.
This 100 million facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving
period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in February 2021 and elected not to renew it. 

In a securitization and in
our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations
and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or
warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid
interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at
a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will
bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. 

In a securitization, the related
special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts
falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An
unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both
our liquidity and results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We believe that our accounting
policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Term Securitizations, (d) Accrual
for Contingent Liabilities and (e) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Such policies are described below. 

Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value 

Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair
value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we
consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future
with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal
rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter,
we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest
rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value
of the receivables. 

We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables
at the close of each measurement period. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment
would be required. Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a 15.3 million mark to the carrying value of the portion of
the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The mark-up was the result of lower than expected losses during the period as our
previous estimates for higher losses due to the pandemic had not materialized. 

In the fourth quarter of 2022, our re-evaluation
of the fair values of these receivables resulted in a positive mark for certain older receivables and a negative mark to the fair values
of newer receivables that largely offset each other. As a result, on a net basis, no mark was taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

35 

Anticipated credit losses are included in our
estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the
appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate
of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also, because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the
level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our
initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record
acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we
recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. 

Allowance for Finance Credit Losses 

In order to estimate an appropriate
allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as static
pooling, which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into
separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance
for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio
of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance
by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral
and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables
acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair
value method of accounting for finance receivables. 

Broad economic factors such
as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average
age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels
of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually
increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. 

The credit performance of
our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for
purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit
performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. 

We generally do not lower
the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent
basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount
of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. 

Effective
January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326, which changes the criteria under which credit
losses on financial instruments (such as the Company s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduced a new credit reserving
model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously
used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. The adoption
of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company s
receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables
that were originated prior to January 2018, as our legacy portfolio . To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition
to its allowance for finance credit losses of 127.0 million. 

Term Securitizations 

Our term securitization structure has generally
been as follows: 

We sell automobile contracts
we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our
automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory
trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal
balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except
that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors
purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase
the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. 

36 

We structure our securitizations
to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread
account held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization
of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal
balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal
credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement
be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified
levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid
under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending
on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement
among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from
time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing
the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding
balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. 

Upon each transfer of automobile
contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance
sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. 

We receive periodic base servicing
fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for
financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are
entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to
pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and
custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal
balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts
that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100 , the related securitization
agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified
percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. 

If the amount of cash required
for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection
period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary
for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related
spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization
is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although
spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in
the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization
transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts.
Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization
agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed
notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. 

In all of our term securitizations
and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary)
to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings
we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to
us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely
basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and
our retained interests in the respective trusts. 

37 

Accrual for Contingent Liabilities 

We are routinely involved
in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal
counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it
is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. 

We have recorded a liability
as of December 31, 2022, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount
of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us,
we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as
of December 31, 2022, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed 11.2 million. 

Accordingly, we believe that
the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent
in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves
we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending
on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes
under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Deferred tax assets are recognized
subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax
asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. 

In determining the possible
future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable
temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that
it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred
tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal
of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements,
and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under Risk Factors, 
and in particular under the subheading Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements may affect whether such projections prove
to be correct. 

We recognize interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions 

We depend upon the availability
of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our
automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 95 term securitizations of approximately 17.7 billion in contracts. We generally
conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar
year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset
of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently, we successfully
completed securitizations in June and September 2020 and four securitizations in each of 2021 and 2022. 

38 

Financial Covenants 

Certain of our securitization
transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results.
Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain
securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default
if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31,
2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues . During the year ended
December 31, 2022, our revenues were 329.7 million, an increase of 61.9 million, or 23.1 , from the prior year revenues of 267.8 million.
The primary reason for the increase in revenues is the increase in interest income resulting from the increase in the average outstanding
balance of finance receivables measured at fair value. In addition, mark ups to the finance receivables measured at fair value also contributed
to the increase in revenues during the year. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 include a 15.3 million mark up to the recorded
value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The marks are estimates based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value
and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and increases or decreases in our estimates
of future net losses. 

Results for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2022 included the 15.3 million mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value.
The mark-up was the result of lower than expected losses during the period as our previous estimates for higher losses due to the pandemic
had not materialized. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these receivables resulted in a positive
mark for certain older receivables and a negative mark to the fair values of newer receivables that largely offset each other. As a result,
on a net basis, no mark was taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues for the prior year period include a 4.4 million mark down to
the fair value portfolio. 

Revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2021 include a 4.4 million mark down to the fair value portfolio. 

Interest income for the year
ended December 31, 2022 increased 39.0 million, or 14.6 , to 305.2 million from 266.2 million in the prior year. The primary reason
for the increase in interest income is the 32.5 increase in the average balance of finance receivables measured at fair value over the
prior year period. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Other income was 9.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This 54.1 increase was primarily
driven by the increase in origination and servicing fees we earned from third party receivables that we began originating in May 2021.
These fees were 6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 1.3 million in the prior year period. 

39 

Expenses . Our operating expenses
consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision
for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio
of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable
to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing
12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs
and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors
that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors
such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. 

Employee costs include base
salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options,
and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with
the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. 

Other operating expenses consist
largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising
expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Total operating expenses were
 213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 202.1 million for the prior year, an increase of 11.5 million, or 5.7 .
The increase is primarily due to increases in interest expense, sales expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses.
Reductions in provisions for credit losses offset some of the increase in operating expenses. 

Employee costs increased by
 3.7 million or 4.7 , to 84.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, representing 39.5 of total operating expenses. Employee
costs were 80.5 million in the prior year, or 39.9 of total operating expenses.

General and administrative expenses
include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit
services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were 37.6 million, an increase of 3.0 million, or 8.7 , compared
to the previous year and represented 17.6 of total operating expenses. 

40 

Interest expense for the year
ended December 31, 2022 increased by 12.3 million to 87.5 million, or 16.3 , compared to 75.2 million in the previous year. Interest
expense represented 41.0 of total operating expenses in 2022. The primary reason for the increase in interest expense is the increase
in interest expense on our warehouse lines of credit and securitization trust debt. 

Interest on securitization trust
debt increased by 6.2 million, or 9.7 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization
trust debt increased 11.0 to 2,020.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,819.9 million for the year ended December
31, 2021. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have increased in 2022 after decreasing in 2021. For any particular quarterly
securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for
benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing
to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have
resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are
summarized in the table below:

The annualized average rate
on our securitization trust debt was 3.5 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The annualized average rate is influenced by
the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization
since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate
bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. 

Interest expense on warehouse
lines of credit was 10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 4.4 million in the prior year. Lower rates were offset
by higher utilization of our credit lines during the year compared to last year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was 130.1
million during 2022 compared to 51.3 million in 2021. 

Interest expense on residual
interest financing was 4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.8 million in the prior year as the average balance
has increased. 

Interest expense on our subordinated
renewable notes decreased by 297,000, or 11.3 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The average balance
of the notes increased from 25.3 million in the prior year to 26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average interest
rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 8.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 10.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The annualized yield on our finance receivables
was 12.0 for 2022 compared to 12.4 in 2021. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected
losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these fair value receivables was 2,388.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,802.6 million in the prior year period. 

Effective January 1, 2020,
the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally
referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on
the portion of the Company s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded
an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of 127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to
the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective
method. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded
a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of 28.1 million compared to 14.6 million in 2021. The
reserve decreases were primarily due to improved credit performance for these
receivables. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. 
Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting,
we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables
measured at fair value. 

Sales expense consists primarily
of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions
based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers. Sales expense increased
by 6.2 million to 23.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and represented 10.8 of total operating expenses. We purchased
 1,854.4 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,146.3 million in the prior year period. 

Occupancy expenses decreased
by 180,000 or 2.3 , to 7.5 million compared to 7.7 million in the previous year and represented 3.5 of total operating expenses. 

Depreciation and amortization
expenses decreased by 57,000 or 3.4 , to 1.6 million compared to 1.7 million in the previous year and represented 0.8 of total operating
expenses. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of 30.2 million, representing a 26 effective tax rate. In the prior period, our income tax
expense was 18.2 million, representing a 28 effective tax rate. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31,
2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020 

Revenues . During
the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were 267.8 million, a decrease of 3.4 million, or 1.2 , from the prior year revenues
of 271.2 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended
December 31, 2021 decreased 28.7 million, or 9.7 , to 266.3 million from 295.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the
decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our legacy portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which
accrued interest at an average of 20.2 , which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair
value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account
of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average
balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are net of mark downs
of 4.4 million and 29.5 million, respectively, to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down
is an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently
acquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic. 

Other income was 6.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Expenses . Our operating expenses
consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision
for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio
of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable
to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing
12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs
and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors
that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors
such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. 

Employee costs include base
salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options,
and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with
the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. 

Other operating expenses consist
largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising
expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Total operating expenses were
 202.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 251.0 million for the prior year, a decrease of 49.0 million, or 19.5 .
The decrease is primarily due to a decreases in interest expense and provisions for credit losses. 

Employee costs increased by
 336,000 or 0.4 , to 80.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 39.9 of total operating expenses, from 80.2
million for the prior year, or 31.9 of total operating expenses. Employee costs for 2021 include approximately 8.0 million for the establishment
of a bonus pool for a segment of employees we classify as Managers.

employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021

General and administrative expenses
include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit
services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were 34.6 million, an increase of 2.6 million, or 8.2 , compared
to the previous year and represented 17.1 of total operating expenses. 

Interest expense for the year
ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 26.1 million to 75.2 million, or 25.8 , compared to 101.3 million in the previous year. Interest
expense represented 37.2 of total operating expenses in 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense is the decrease
in securitization trust debt interest. 

Interest on securitization trust
debt decreased by 23.6 million, or 26.9 , for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization
trust debt decreased 9.8 to 1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2,017.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2020. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally decreased since 2019 and have stayed relatively low in
2021 despite trending upward throughout the year. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is
ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our
bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand
for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt
interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below:

The annualized average rate
on our securitization trust debt was 3.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 4.4 for 2020. The annualized average rate
is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any
particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter
term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. 

Interest expense on warehouse
lines of credit decreased by 3.2 million, or 42.1 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease was
primarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was 51.3 million
during 2021 compared to 92.5 million in 2020. 

Interest expense on residual
interest financing was 3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 3.5 million in the prior year as the average balance
has increased.

Interest expense on our subordinated
renewable notes increased by 466,000, or 21.4 , for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance
of the notes increased from 19.3 million in the prior year to 25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average interest
rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 10.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 11.2 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance
receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables
measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is
therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was 1,802.6 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 1,631.5 million in the prior year period. 

Effective January 1, 2020,
the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally
referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on
the portion of the Company s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded
an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of 127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to
the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective
method. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded
a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of 14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due
to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance. In the prior year period, we recorded an
increase to provision for credit losses for 14.1 million. That provision represented our estimate in 2020 of additional forecasted losses
that might be incurred as a result of the pandemic on our portfolio of finance receivables. Such losses were not considered in our initial
estimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded upon our adoption of CECL in January 2020. 

The allowance applies only to
our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we
have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income
net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. 

Sales expense consists primarily
of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions
based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs,
internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense increased by 2.7 million to 16.9 million during the year ended December
31, 2021 and represented 8.4 of total operating expenses. We purchased 1,146.3 million of new contracts during the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to 742.6 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in
contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Since then, our contract purchase volumes have gradually increased
to pre-pandemic levels. 

Occupancy expenses increased
by 294,000 or 4.0 , to 7.7 million compared to 7.4 million in the previous year and represented 3.8 of total operating expenses. 

Depreciation and amortization
expenses decreased by 109,000 or 6.1 , to 1.7 million compared to 1.8 million in the previous year and represented 0.8 of total operating
expenses. 

Income tax expense was 18.2
million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of 1.6 million for 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic
Security CARES Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component
of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses NOLs arising from 2018, 2019
and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 . However,
the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35 , which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect
for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of 680,000 and 8.8 million
for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense for 2021 would have been 18.9 million, representing an
effective income tax rate of 29 . For 2020, income tax expense would have been 7.2 million for an effective tax rate of 36 .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

Our business requires substantial
cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows
from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving
credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables,
fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts.
Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization
transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses,
the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels
in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet
our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the
level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio,
and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. 

Net cash provided by operating
activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 215.9 million, 198.2 million and 238.8 million, respectively. Net
cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our
provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables. 

Net cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 713.9 million and 115.4 million, respectively. This compares to net cash
provided by investing activities of 93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in investing activities generally relates
to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were 1,673.2 million (includes acquisition fees paid), 1,107.5
million and 739.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal
payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities were 484.2 million in 2022. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 50.4
million and 328.5 million, respectively. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization
trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit
and other debt. We issued 1,411.0 million in new securitization trust debt in 2022 compared to 1,110.7 million in 2021 and 714.5 million
in 2020. Repayments of securitization debt were 1,060.1 million, 1,153.1 million and 1,010.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

We purchase automobile contracts
from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase
or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We
have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term
financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to
finance our continuing operations. 

The acquisition of automobile
contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,
if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount
of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement
in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to
us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate
at which we purchase automobile contracts. 

48 

We are and may in the future
be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had unrestricted
cash of 13.5 million and 114.7 million aggregate available borrowings under our two warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability
of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 22.1 million of such eligible collateral. During 2022,
we completed four securitizations aggregating 1,411.0 million of notes sold. In January 2023, we completed another securitization with
 324.8 million of notes sold. Cash proceeds from this securitization were used to pay down the outstanding balance on our two warehouse
credit facilities thus increasing the amounts available for borrowing under these facilities. Our plans to manage our liquidity include
maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our
operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases,
in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. 

Our liquidity will also be
affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread
account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only
if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contracts
in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels,
the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance
that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. 

Our warehouse credit facilities
contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum
levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our
term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a
default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be
accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. 

We currently have and will
continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,469.0 million of debt outstanding.
Such debt consisted primarily of 2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included 285.3 million of warehouse lines of
credit, 49.6 million of residual interest financing debt and 25.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. 

Although we believe we are
able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate
sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness
when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities.

which will depend on the performance of such receivables, as to which there can be no assurance, are 804.4 million in 2023, 578.9 million
in 2024, 339.1 million in 2025, 202.3 million in 2026, 128.1 million in 2027, 55.3 million in 2028, and 0.6 million in 2029.

We anticipate
repaying debt due in 2023 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. 

Warehouse Credit Facilities 

The terms on which credit
has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse
credit facilities: 

Facility Established in
May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured
to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary
Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 82.0 of eligible finance receivables. The Class A loans under
the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 3.00 per annum, with
a minimum rate of 3.75 per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 4.00 per annum,
with a minimum rate of 4.75 per annum. The Class B loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at
a per annum rate equal to 8.50 per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to 9.50 per annum. In July 2022,
we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., and doubled the capacity from 100 million to 200 million. This
facility was amended to extend the revolving period to July 2024 and to include an amortization period through July 2025 for any receivables
pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was 150.3 million outstanding under this facility. 

Facility Established in
November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of
Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile
contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective
advances up to 88.00 of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.15 
per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.15 per annum. On February 2, 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent
Services, L.P. In June 2022, we increased the capacity of our credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from 100 million to 200
million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028
for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was 137.6 million outstanding
under this facility. 

Capital Resources 

Securitization trust debt
is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related
receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly
later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored
asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. 

The acquisition of automobile
contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,
if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent
on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent
to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts.
We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash
from the trusts and related spread accounts.

Residual Interest Financing. On
May 16, 2018, we completed a 40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual
interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased 40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests
in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80 interest in a CPS affiliate
that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes 2018-1 Notes ), issued
by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595 . The notes were paid off in February 2022. 

On June 30, 2021, we completed
a 50 million securitization of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction,
qualified institutional buyers purchased 50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations
consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes 2021-1 Notes ), issued by CPS Auto Securitization
Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86 . At December 31, 2022 there was 50.0 million outstanding under this facility. 

51 

The agreed valuation of the
collateral for the 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization
and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the
related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment
date, the 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified
minimum collateral ratio. 

Securitization Trust Debt. 
Since 2011, we treated all 45 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes,
and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt.
We had 2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. 

Subordinated Renewable
Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public.
Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor
notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are
offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may
be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2022 there were 25.3 million of such notes outstanding. 

We must comply with certain
affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios
related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In
addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors
to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

Forward-looking Statements 

This report on Form 10-K includes
certain forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as anticipates, 
 expects, plans, estimates, or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking
statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plague
that might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to such
events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which might impair the obligation to perform contracts, or the ability
of obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant
to the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts;
and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that
could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect
our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts
to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors
that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand
for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations).
The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial
items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could
cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability
and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The
accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit
performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that
generally affect our profitability.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

Interest Rate Risk 

We are subject to interest
rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization.
Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed.
Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase
while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely
decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate
environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest
to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until
several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts,
set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash
flow. 

To mitigate, but not eliminate,
the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts
in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest
rates payable by us in securitizations, we have usually structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures,
whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We may continue to use pre-funding structures
in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional
contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver
to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market
yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding.
The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive
less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures . Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, management of the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act as of December 31, 2022 (the Evaluation
Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
(i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report.

Internal Control. Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Management, with the participation
of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the
participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria. 

Our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 

 Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

 Las Vegas, Nevada 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements 2 .
We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company s management is responsible
for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

F- 2 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Accounting for Loans at Fair Value 

As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company carries all finance receivables acquired after 2017 at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company
had 2.4 billion in finance receivables that are carried at fair value, all of which are classified as level 3 fair values as they contain
one or more inputs which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. With assistance from an outside valuation expert,
the Company used a level 3 fair value methodology for the fair value of finance receivables. The significant assumptions used by the Company
to calculate the fair value of these financial receivables include the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization
of the portfolio of finance receivables. These significant assumptions were based on the factors that market participants use in pricing
similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

We identified the valuation of finance receivables
carried at fair value as a critical audit matter as this estimate requires subjective auditor judgment. Our principal considerations in
making this determination are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by the Company in determining the assumptions to estimate
fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair
value of these finance receivables, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in
evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. 

F- 3 

Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the
application of the assumptions used to support the estimate of loans at fair value included addressing: 

The completeness and accuracy of data 
 
 Third-party model review 
 
 Review of management s judgments and significant assumptions over inputs 

Substantively testing management's process, including
evaluating management s judgments and assumptions, for developing the estimate of loans at fair value included: 

Using an auditor employed valuation specialist to assist in testing the Company s estimate of fair
value of the finance receivables. Testing included evaluation of certain management significant assumptions and, evaluating the appropriateness
of the methodology including a recalculation of the model. 
 
 Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the fair value of finance receivables
estimate. 

Allowance for Finance Credit Losses 
Qualitative Factors Related to the CECL Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts 

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial
statements, the Company has a gross receivables portfolio of 92.3 million and a related allowance for finance credit losses (ACL) on
loans of 21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management estimates the allowance using relevant information from internal
and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience
for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on the calendar quarter of origination is used to estimate expected losses
for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. This estimate is adjusted by certain qualitative factors that may impact future credit losses.
The qualitative factors represent management s estimate of the impact of future losses. 

The use of qualitative factors to adjust historical
losses for management s forecast requires significant judgment. Management applies qualitative factors to adjust its estimation
of the timing and amount losses to represent its future economic forecast. We identified auditing the reasonableness of qualitative factors
used to create forecasts in its credit loss model as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. 

Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the
application of the assumptions used to support the estimate of the allowance for credit losses included addressing: 

The completeness and accuracy of internal data 
 
 Review of management s judgments and significant assumptions over inputs 

Substantively testing management's process, including
evaluating management s judgments and assumptions, for developing the estimate of the allowance for credit losses included: 

Evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology for developing the forecast and qualitative factors. 
 
 Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation of qualitative factors. 
 
 Evaluating the reasonableness of the forecasts. 
 
 Inspecting and evaluating key assumptions and judgments used in developing the qualitative factors.

, , , , , , and respectively, of contracts purchased during 2022 compared

We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by
commercial banks or automobile manufacturers captive finance companies. 

We are subject to various
regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations
could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

million , which exceeded
the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. 

Our portfolio of finance receivables
consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency
on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until
the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract
that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. 

million positive mark to the
carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The Company considered the effect of the pandemic
on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of million for the twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2021. 

Anticipated credit losses
are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation
of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate
of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the
level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our
initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record
acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we
recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. 

and 
million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Our warehouse securitization
structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes
or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts
in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts
and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. 

We have the power to direct
the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from
the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured
financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization
trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

We receive periodic base servicing
fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent
collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and
certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments
sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those
contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100 , the related
Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified
percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization 
of the Notes. 

If the amount of cash required
for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall
is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above
allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account
or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level,
then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted
from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the
Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization
Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders and
the related securitization Trusts recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is
limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts.

Our securitization transactions
and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement.
These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

In January 2018 the Company
adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are
recorded separately on the Company s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. 

The following table presents the components of
finance receivables, net of unearned interest: 

Unearned acquisition fees, discounts and deferred origination costs, net 

Finance receivables 

We consider an automobile
contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90 of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may
have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments
are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent.
In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor s
next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension
may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest.
Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following
table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

31-60 days 

61-90 days 

91 + days 

Finance receivables totaling
 million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their
delinquency status. 

Allowance for Credit Losses
 Finance Receivables 

The allowance for credit losses
is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to present the net amount expected to be
collected. Charge offs are deducted from the allowance when management believes that collectability is unlikely. 

Management estimates the allowance
using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and, reasonable
and supportable forecasts. We believe our historical credit loss experience provides the best basis for the estimation of expected credit
losses. Consequently, we use historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on their calendar quarter
of origination, to forecast expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. 

We measure the weighted average
monthly incremental change in cumulative net losses for the vintage pools in the relevant historical period. For the pools in the relevant
historical period, we consider each pool s performance from its inception through the end of the current period. We then apply the
results of the historical analysis to less seasoned vintage pools beginning with each vintage pool s most recent actual cumulative
net loss experience and extrapolating from that point based on the historical data. We believe the pattern and magnitude of losses on
older vintages allows us to establish a reasonable and supportable forecast of less seasoned vintages. 

Our contract purchase guidelines
are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key credit characteristics of individual contracts such as obligor credit history,
job stability, residence stability and ability to pay, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Similarly,
for key structural characteristics such as loan-to-value, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively
little variation from the average for the portfolio. Consequently, we do not believe there are significant differences in risk characteristics
between various segments of our portfolio. 

Our methodology incorporates
historical pools that are sufficiently seasoned to capture the magnitude and trends of losses within those vintage pools. Furthermore,
the historical period encompasses a substantial volume of receivables over periods that include fluctuations in the competitive landscape,
the Company s rates of growth, size of our managed portfolio and fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment. 

In consideration of the depth
and breadth of the historical period, and the homogeneity of our portfolio, we generally do not adjust historical loss information for
differences in risk characteristics such as credit or structural composition of segments of the portfolio or for changes in environmental
conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, collateral values or other factors. Throughout our history we have observed how events
such as extreme weather, political unrest, and other qualitative factors have influenced the performance of our portfolio. Consequently,
we have considered how such qualitative factors may affect future credit losses and have incorporated our judgement of the effect of those
factors into our estimates.

At the adoption of CECL, the Company recorded
an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of million . In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to
the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective
method. 

The Company recorded a reduction to provision
for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021,
respectively. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance,
an improved macroeconomic outlook and higher used car prices. The Company made additional provisions for credit losses of million 
for the year ended December 30, 2020. Those reserve increases were made in consideration for the uncertainty associated with the pandemic.

Debt issuance costs of 
million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These
debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. 

All of the securitization
trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned,
bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. 

The terms of the various securitization
agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with
respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage
levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2022. 

We are responsible for the
administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts
to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December
31, 2022, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately million . Interest expense on the securitization trust
debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include
facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the
time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly,
the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. 

Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy
remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue
the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the
applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries
have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes,
are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available
to pay any of our other creditors.

On May 11, 2012, we entered
into a million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the
purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The
facility provides for effective advances up to 86.0 of eligible finance receivables. The Class A loans under the facility generally accrue
interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 3.00 per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75 per
annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 4.00 per annum, with a minimum rate of 4.75 
per annum. The Class B loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to 8.50 
per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to 9.50 per annum. In July 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving
credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., and doubled the capacity from 100 million to 200 million. This facility was amended to extend
the revolving period to July 2024 and to include an amortization period through July 2025 for any receivables pledged to the facility
at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was million outstanding under this facility. 

On February 2, 2022, we renewed
our two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the
purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The
facility provides for effective advances up to 88.00 of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at
a commercial paper rate plus 4.15 per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.15 per annum. In June 2022, we increased the capacity of our credit
agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from 100 million to 200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to
January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving
period. At December 31, 2022 there was million outstanding under this facility. 

The total outstanding debt
on our two warehouse lines of credit was million as of December 31, 2022, compared to million outstanding as of December
31, 2021. 

On June 30, 2021, we completed
a million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction,
qualified institutional buyers purchased million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations
consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes 2021-1 Notes ), issued by CPS Auto Securitization
Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86 . At December 31, 2022 there was million outstanding under this facility. 

The agreed valuation of the
collateral for the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization
and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the
related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment
date, the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain
a specified minimum collateral ratio. 

Unamortized debt issuance
costs of and as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the amount reported
above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

We must comply with certain
affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios
related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted
payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1.

to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000, 19,200,000 and , respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior
plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an
exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and
vesting generally over 4-5 years. 

The per share weighted-average
fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was ,
 ,
and ,
respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the
following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical
and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 
to 
for 2022, 
to 
for 2021, and 
to 
for 2020. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of
the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future.

For the years ended December
31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of million , million and million , respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to million .
This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of years. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021,
options outstanding had intrinsic values of million and million , respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, options exercisable
had intrinsic values of million and million , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was million 
and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during
the year ended December 2022 and cash of million was received. At December 31, 2022, there were a total of additional
shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan.

Income tax expense for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before
income taxes as follows:

Net deferred tax asset 

We acquired certain net operating
losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. MFN in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. TFC in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with
a net operating loss NOL carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses BILs )) to utilize
its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. 

In determining the possible
future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable
temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years
in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. 

Deferred tax assets are recognized
subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax
asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization
is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of million as of December 31, 2022 is more
likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of 10.2 million consists of approximately million 
of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and million of net state deferred tax assets. 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of million . These state net operating losses begin to expire
in 2023. 

We recognize a tax position
as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax
examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being
realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize
potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2022, we had no unrecognized
tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. 

We are subject to taxation
in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations
by tax authorities for years before 2018.

Legal Proceedings 

Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved
in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers
can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes
allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which
we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. 

Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency
judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were
not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed.
The defendant s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis,
not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. In April 2022, a
motion for certification of a class was filed but has not been ruled upon. It is reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims
will be on a class basis. 

Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018,
a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified
our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective
provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney
fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date
of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to
our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. 

Massachusetts Civil Investigative Demand .
In September 2021, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
relating to the Company s communications with and repossession notices sent to Massachusetts customers. We are cooperating with
the inquiry. 

In General. There
can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most
recently as of December 31, 2022, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters
identified above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such
information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31,
2022 is 
million , and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including
those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2022 does not exceed 
million . 

Accordingly, we believe that
the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors,
the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. 

per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were million , million ,
and million respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

We also sponsor a defined
benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the Plan ). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001.

Total 

Our investment policies
and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75 equity securities and 25 fixed income securities (excluding
Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management
and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international
equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity
or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization,
the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors
are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors
are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable.

actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2022, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles
in inventory totaled million . We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of million , which is based on a recovery
rate of approximately , resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of . The fair value and carrying amount of
the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2021 was million after applying a valuation adjustment of million .
